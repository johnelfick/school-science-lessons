<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="32.1.0H"></a>32.1.0 Voltage, emf sources, Voltage produced by:<br>
 voltage = electrical potential difference<br>
 1. emf<br>
 The force that causes free electrons to move in a conductor may be called voltage, electromotive force, emf, difference in potential difference or even "electrical pressure".<br>
 The electromotive force, emf, is not really a "force" measured in newtons, 
but a potential, i.e. energy per unit charge, measured in volts, V.<br>
 Potential difference can be thought of as the concentration of charge, 
measured in volts, V.<br>
The energy available to charges moving in an electrical circuit is measured using electric potential difference, which is defined as the change in<br>
 potential energy per unit charge between two defined points in the circuit.<br>
 Energy is required to separate positive and negative charge carriers;
 charge separation produces an electrical potential difference that 
 can be used to drive current in circuits.<br>
 An emf of 1 volt (1V) across a component with resistance of 1 ohm
drives a current of 1 A through it.<br>
2. Volt<br>
 The volt, symbol V (Alessandro Volta 1745-1827), is the SI unit of 
electric potential (potential difference, emf).<br>
 The value expressed in volts is called the voltage, defined as the difference 
of potential between two points on a conductor carrying 
 one ampere of current when the power dissipated is one watt.<br>
 A potential difference of 1 volt = 1 joule per coulomb, 1 J / C.<br>
 3. Power<br>
 Power is the rate at which energy is transformed by a circuit component; 
power enables quantitative analysis of energy 
 transformations in the circuit.<br>
 If connected by a conductor, electrons will flow from a negatively charged 
body to a positively charged body until the two charges are 
 equal and the potential difference no longer exists.<br>
 When a cell does work W to drive a charge Q around a circuit, the cell 
has an electromotive force E, E = W / Q = P / I.<br>
 (where W = watt, the SI unit of power, charge = Q, P = power and I = current).<br>
 P = W t = VI = IR x I = I<sup>2</sup>R.<br>
 P = power, W = work = energy transformed, t = time interval, V = potential 
difference, I = current.<br>
 So a source of potential difference, e.g. a cell, has electromotive force, emf in this document.<br>
 However, emf is not a "force" although it does cause charges to move around the circuit.<br>
The emf is really energy per unit charge.<br>
 Potential difference is different from emf, because in current electricity potential difference always refers to energy loss in a circuit, e.g. conversion to heat and light in an incandescent bulb.<br>
 The unit of potential difference is the volt, V.<br>
 An electric current can flow in a conductor only if a potential difference, V, exists across it.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="32.1.2.1H">32.1.2.1</a> Piezoelectricity, voltage produced by mechanical stress to crystals<br>
<a href="topicIndexPotassium.html#PotassiumsodtartrateH">Rochelle salt</a>, potassium sodium tartrate-4-water<br>
<a href="/images/32.1.1.2.gif">See diagram 31.1.1.2</a>: Voltage produced by pressure.<br>
<a href="/images/16.3.7ch.gif">See diagram 16.3.7</a>: Potassium sodium tartrate.<br>
Experiment<br>
 1. Show ferroelectricity hysteresis, Curie point and the direct piezoelectric 
effect with Rochelle salt, 
 (potassium sodium tartrate-4-water).<br>
 Natural crystals are rare, e.g. diamond.<br>
 They manufacture most crystals used in industry.<br>
 When a crystal of quartz or Rochelle salt (Seignette salt) is compressed, 
some electrons move through the crystal.<br>
 This movement creates an electric potential difference between the two 
opposite faces of the crystal.<br>
 If an external wire is connected while the pressure and emf are present, 
electrons will flow until the charges are equalized.<br>
 When the force is removed, the crystal is decompressed, and immediately
 causes an electric force in the opposite direction.<br>
 The crystal can convert mechanical force to electrical force.<br>
 Although the power capacity of a crystal is extremely small, they are
useful, because of their extreme sensitivity to changes of 
 mechanical force or changes in temperature.<br>
 The regular piezoelectric signal from a quartz crystal in an electronic 
watch allow the watch to keep almost perfect time.<br>
 Piezoelectricity is the phenomenon in certain crystals anc ceramics 
when application of mechanical stress causes electric charge with 
 the voltage proportional to the stress.<br>
 It occurs in crystals of cane sugar, quartz, Rochelle salt (potassium
 sodium tartrate-4-water), topaz, tourmaline.<br>
2. Connect Rochelle salt to a neon lamp or electrostatic voltmeter.<br>
 Make sheets of polycrystalline Rochelle salt that show piezoelectric 
effects.<br>
 Measure the voltage of a Rochelle salt crystal under various stresses
produced by a mass on a lever arm.<br>
 Excite a Rochelle salt crystal with an audio voltage and couple it to 
a sounding board.<br>
 Connect an audio oscillator to a large Rochelle salt crystal and the sound 
can be distinctly heard.<br>
 Apply an audio oscillator to a Rochelle salt and amplify with a wood
sounding board.<br>
3. Demonstrate piezoelectricity by dusting the cooling
or warming crystal with a dust of red lead and sulfur that has passed through
a silk or nylon screen.<br>
 A simple bellows can be made from a plastic nasal spray or deodorant 
bottle in that the aperture has been enlarged to allow a 
 sizeable spray to be emitted.<br>
 Place in the bottle a mixture of about 2 parts red lead to 1 part sulfur.<br>
 Put a small piece of silk or nylon stocking over the mouth of the bottle.<br>
 Tighten this with a rubber band.<br>
 The dust particles receive electric charges as they pass through the
screen formed by the stocking.<br>
 They settle on the end of the crystal that attracts them.<br>
 The red lead gets a positive charge and goes to the negative end of the 
crystal.<br>
 The sulfur gets a negative charge and settles on the positive end of
the crystal.<br>
4. Barbecue piezo-igniters<br>
 These fire lighters contain quartz crystals that have piezoelectric 
properties and so develop electric potential under stress.<br>
 When two crystals are struck together separation of charge in the crystal 
lattice can produce a very high voltage.<br>
4. Mosquito bite clicker<br>
 This handy gadget can relieve the pain caused by bites of mosquitoes, 
 sand flies and midges, and also the stings of small jellyfish, by 
 injecting a small electric current into the affected skin.<br>
 It is powered by piezoelectricity and not batteries, so it is small, 
light weight and easy to use.<br>
5. Piezoelectric sheets are made from ceramic lead-zirconate-titanate 
 (PZT).<br>
Make a ball and spring model of the piezoelectric effect.<br>
Attach a piezoelectric sparker to a Braun electroscope.<br>
 Mount a sphere on the end of a piezoelectric gas lighter.<br>
 Use a piezoelectric gun to discharge a set of charged nylon strings.<br>
 Attach one end of a piezoelectric crystal to a needle point in the piezoelectric 
pistol.<br>
 The best generators of piezoelectric electric are very thin zinc oxide 
wires that can generate 200 milliwatts per cubic centimetres when 
 squeezed, e.g. by the foot.<br>
 So piezoelectric crystals may be incorporated into footwear to produce 
people-powered energy.<br>
 A gas piezoelectric home lighter acts as a cheap source of 
reliable static electricity.<br>
 It is constructed by shortening the earth electrode and the attachment
 of an aluminized Christmas tree decoration.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="32.1.4H"></a>32.1.4 Photoelectric cell, voltage produced by light<br>
See: <a href="Commercial3.html#LightH">Photoelectric</a> Planck's Constant, (Commercial).<br>
 Voltage is produced by light striking photosensitive (light sensitive)
 substances.<br>
When light strikes the surface of a substance, e.g. compounds of silver oxide or copper oxide, it may dislodge electrons from the atoms at the surface, 
 the substance becomes positively charged, and an electric force is created.<br>
Experiment<br>
 1.<a href="/images/32.1.1.4a.gif">See diagram 4.1.1.4a</a>: Voltage produced by light, photoelectric cell.<br>
 This photoelectric cell has a curved light sensitive surface focussed
on the central anode.<br>
 When light from the direction shown strikes the sensitive surface, it 
emits electrons towards the anode.<br>
 The more intense the light, the greater is the number of electrons emitted.<br>
 When you connect a wire between the filament and the back or dark side, 
the accumulated electrons will flow to the dark side.<br>
 These electrons will eventually pass through the metal of the reflector 
and replace the electrons leaving the light sensitive surface.<br>
 Thus light energy is converted to a flow of electrons, and a usable current 
develops.<br>
 2. Photoelectric cell construction.<br>
 This photoelectric cell is constructed in layers.<br>
<a href="/images/32.1.1.4b.gif">See diagram 4.1.1.4b</a>: Photoelectric cell construction.<br>
 A base plate of pure copper is coated with light sensitive copper oxide.<br>
 An extremely thin additional layer of metal is put over the copper oxide 
to allow penetration of light to the copper oxide and 
 accumulate the electrons emitted by the copper oxide.<br>
 An externally connected wire completes the electron path, the same as 
in the reflector type cell.<br>
 The photocell's voltage is used as needed by connecting the external 
wires to another device, which amplifies (enlarges) it to a usable 
 level.<br>
 A photocell's power capacity is very small.<br>
 However, it reacts to light intensity variations in an extremely short 
time.<br>
 This characteristic makes the photocell very useful in detecting or accurately 
controlling many processes or operations.<br>
 For instance, the photoelectric cell, or some form of the photoelectric 
 principle, is used in television cameras, automatic 
 manufacturing process controls, door openers, burglar alarms.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="32.1.5.0H"></a>32.1.5.0 Voltage produced by chemical action, battery<br>
<a href="/images/3.2.84ch.gif">See diagram 3.2.84: </a> Copper and zinc foil in a voltmeter.<br>
 Voltage is produced by chemical reaction in a battery cell.<br>
 Electrons may be removed from atoms and set in motion by energy derived 
from forms of energy, e.g. friction, pressure, heat, or light.<br>
 These physical actions do not alter the molecules of the substances 
being acted upon.<br>
 Molecules are not added, taken away, or split.<br>
 Only electrons are lost or added.<br>
 If the molecules of a substance combine with atoms of another substance, 
or give up atoms of its own, the action is chemical in nature.<br>
 When atoms are added to or taken from the molecules of a substance, 
the chemical change will cause the substance to take an electric 
 charge.<br>
 The process of producing a voltage by chemical action is used in batteries.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="32.3.01H"></a>32.3.01 Ohm's law, rheostat<br>
 See: <a href="Commercial3.html#CircuitsH">AC Circuits</a>, (Commercial).<br>
 See: <a href="Commercial3.html#OhmslawH">Ohm's law</a>, (Commercial).<br>
<a href="/images/32.3.1.1d.gif">See diagram 32.3.1.1d</a>: Circuits for demonstrating Ohm's law.<br>
<a href="/images/32.3.1.gif">See diagram 32.3.1</a>: Resistor colour code.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2">Ohm's law<br>
(George Simon Ohm 1789-1854 Germany)<br>
1. Introduction to Ohm's law<br>
The law for a part of a circuit is expressed by the equation I = V / R, where I is current (also intensity of current) through a conductor, 
V is potential difference (also drop of voltage) between the ends of this conductor, and R is resistance of the conductor.<br>
 It could be illustrated by a diagram in (Fig. 1), which means that whatever happens outside this conductor, the numerical relations 
 between I, V, and R remain the same.<br>
 If Ohm's law is associated with different diagram (Fig. 2), this diagram implies that the law is valid for a closed circuit with a single resistance 
 and a battery supplying a constant potential difference V.<br>
Students relying on this diagram may difficulty with simply measuring intensity of current I and potential difference V, because Fig. 1 b implies that 
 other parts of the circuit have no resistance.<br>
 So, students may connect the voltmeter in a variety of ways, e.g. between A and B, or B and C, or C and D, and obtain different 
 potential differences.<br>
 The teacher should inform students that every part of the circuit has some resistance.<br>
For example: R is the resistance of a conductor to be measured, RA and RV are resistances of an ammeter and a voltmeter, R0 is an additional 
 resistor necessary to transform an ammeter into a voltmeter, Rwis the resistance of conducting wires (leads), r is the internal resistance of a power 
 source.<br>
Such a circuit would correspond to Ohm's law for the whole circuit I = E / R + r, where R usually means the total resistance of the external circuit, 
E is the electromotive force of the power source, and r is its internal resistance.<br>
Teachers usually introduce this law after the initial introduction of Ohm's law.<br>
2. Student experience of Ohm's law<br>
Students who investigated the effect of length and wire gauge on resistance found the need for at least half a meter of wire to measure changes of resistance.<br>
The multimeter to measure the current had to be in the milliamp range, but the fuse on the milliammeter has a very low power rating and so it burns out easily.<br>
Students used a 1 metre length of nichrome wire pulled tight between two clamped retort stands.<br>
The wire ranging from 20 SWG (0.87 mm) to 32 SWG (0.25 mm).<br>
The results were: 20 SWG 2.6 ohm, 22 SWG 3.3 ohm, 24 SWG 6.2 ohm, and 32 SWG 26.2 ohm.<br>
The graphs were linear with a y-intercept of 0.4 ohm in all cases.<br>
The 0.4 ohm may be the internal resistance of the DMM's battery.<br>
The resistivity came out to 1.2 x 10^-6 ohm m, which seemed quite reasonable.<br>
3. Ohm's law statement<br>
Ohm's law states that the potential difference, V, needed to create electric current, I, for a wire with constant resistance, R, then V = 
 IR, where the SI unit is the volt, V.<br>
 The electric current in a conductor is proportional to the potential difference: V = IR, I = V /R, R = V / I, where R = resistance, V = potential difference, I = current.<br>
 For ohmic resistors, resistance, R, is a constant.<br>
4. Ohm's law application<br>
 Ohm's law applies to volts / amps relationship for electrolytes, 
voltage / current relationship for gases, Ohmic conductors.<br>
 Ohm's law and Kirchoff's laws in simple circuits, the connection of simple 
circuits and use of appropriate meters to measure current.<br>
The emf and potential difference around the circuit, verification of Ohm's 
law with a simple series circuit or voltage divider network, 
 plotting of I / V characteristic curve.<br>
5. Equation for resistance<br>
Ohm's law defines the equation for resistance, V = IR where V
= potential difference (pd) between the ends of a resistor, I = 
 current through the resistor, R = resistance of the resistor.<br>
6. The ohmic and nonohmic materials<br>
The "ohmic" materials have a linear relationship between the applied 
voltage and the resulting electric current.<br>
 The "nonohmic materials do not have this simple relationship, but may 
be very useful substances, e.g. materials to make light-emitting 
 diodes, LEDs.<br>

<a href="/images/32.3.1a.jpg">See diagram 32.3.1a</a>: Resisitor colour code.<br>
Carbon resistors and adjustable carbon composition resistors are commonly used in electronics, because they are compact and cheap, but they are 
 not accurate, especially at high power levels.<br>
 Wire wound resistors and adjustable wire wound resistors may be very accurate 
except at very high power ratings.<br>
 Examine assortment of different resistors.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="32.3.1.1H"></a>32.3.1.1 Resistors, resistances, switches, resistance box<br>
 See: <a href="Commercial.html#ResistancesH">Resistances</a>, (Commercial).<br>
<a href="/images/32.3.1.1d.gif">See diagram 32.3.1.1</a>: Resistance circuit.<br>
Resistors control the electric current in a circuit.<br>
Fixed resistors containing carbon, insulating filler and binding resin vary in resistance value from 1 ohm, usually above 10 ohm.<br>
For higher power rating, a resistance wire is wound around an insulating rod.<br>
Simple resistors occur in filament globe lamps, toaster elements and electric heaters.<br>
An electric current flowing through a resistor always produces heat, and sometimes heat and light.<br>
Variable resistors, potentiometers, allow resistance to be changed, e.g. in a radio volume control.<br>
The electric power, P, is the rate at which electrical energy is converted to another form of energy, e.g. heat.<br>
Power = Energy / Time.<br>
The unit of power, watt (W) is equivalent to i joule of energy consumed in 1 second.<br>
A 60 watt electric light bulb consumes 60 joules of electricity per second.<br>
Power of a resistor, P = voltage across a resistor, V X current through a resistor, V.<br>
P =VI.<br>
Power ratings of resistors may be 0.25 W, 0.5 W, 1 W.<br>
The power rating of a resistor must be greater than the power used in it.<br>
 1. Resistance box<br>
 A resistance box contains coils of wire of known resistance connected in series by thick brass blocks.<br>
 Resistor boxes are used to show Ohm's law.<br>
 A resistance board is set up as a simple Wheatstone bridge to find the resistance.<br>
 You must remove plugs to obtain the required resistance in the circuit.<br>
 2. Relative resistance<br>
The relative resistance of the following conductors of the same length and cross-section, with silver as a standard of "1", are arranged in an order of ascending resistance as follows:<br>
 Silver 1.0, Copper 1.08, Gold 1.4, Aluminium 1.8, Platinum 7.0, Lead 13.5.<br>
 The resistance in an electrical circuit is expressed by the symbol R and is measured in ohms.<br>
One ohm is the resistance of a circuit element that permits a steady current of 1 ampere (1 coulomb per second) to flow when a steady emf of 1 volt 
 is applied to the circuit.<br>
3. Rheostats<br>
Rheostats are used as protective resistors or voltage dividers.<br>
 Coils are rated by number of windings and resistance.<br>
 Manufactured circuit parts containing definite amounts of resistance 
are called resistors.<br>
 5. Resistance wire diameters<br>
Resistance wire diameters are measured by Standard Wire Gauge, SWG (UK, Australia), OR<br>
 Brown and Sharpe (B. and S.) (American Wire Gauge).<br>
 SWG 50 is smallest gauge and SWG 70 the largest.<br>
 Cable sizes are shown as follows:<br>
 14 / 36 = 14 strands of 36 SWG wire to carry 2 amps for internal lighting in a motor car, OR<br>
 61 / 20 = 61 strands of 20 SWG wires to carry 150 amps suitable for 6 volt starter motors in a car.<br>
Experiment<br>
1. Connect one meter lengths of various wires in 
 series and measure the voltage across each.<br>
 Measure voltages on a board with seven one meter lengths 
of various wires is series so all carry the same current.<br>
 Place 6V across a set of wires of different lengths and / or diameters 
and measure the currents.<br>
 2. Make a simple switch.<br>
 Fasten the end of a piece of wire to a pencil with two rubber bands.<br>
 A second wire makes a connection.<br>
 3. Examine switches in a circuit.<br>
 Put a knife switch in a circuit with a cell and a lamp and turn the
light on and off by operating the switch.<br>
 Replace the lamp with a bell or buzzer and operate the switch.<br>
 Replace the knife switch with a push button switch.<br>
 Take apart some common switches such as the common household, tumbler 
switch, rocker switch.<br>
 See how they are constructed.<br>
 4. Find all kinds of electric switches used in daily life, e.g. pull switch, reading lamp switch, suspension wire switch, cassette switch.<br>
Also find some electric keys, e.g. single knife switch, double knives switch, single throw switch, multithrow switch.<br>
 Disassemble some switches that can be disassembled.<br>
Observe the composition of those switches and the connection among down leads and inner components of switches.<br>
In the on-off operation after turning on the switch, prevent the spring from bouncing out or replace it quickly.<br>
 Discuss and summarize what kind of significance the knife number and
the multithrow of switches have.<br>
 Reassemble the disassembled switches.<br>
 Connect different switches into the circuit composed of cells and bulbs.<br>
 Prepare more conducting wires and bulbs for the multiknife or multithrow 
experiment.<br>
 At the end of the experiment observe the values of allow voltage and
allow current, and explicate their significance.<br>
 The values of allowed voltage and allowed current are labelled on the 
outsides of switches.<br>

 See: <a href="Commercial3.html#OhmslawH">Ohm's law</a> (Commercial).<br>
<a href="/images/32.3.1.3a.gif">See diagram: 32.3.1.3a</a>: I-V curve for ohmic conductors.<br>
<a href="/images/32.3.1.3.gif">See diagram: 32.3.1.3</a>: I-V curve for non-ohmic conductor.<br>
* An electrical resistor is a device of known or variable electrical resistance used to cause a drop in voltage itself or to limit the flow of electrical 
 current through itself.<br>
* Resistors that obey Ohm's law are called ohmic resistors.<br>
If you draw a graph of voltage against current, the curve is linear, the slope of the curve is constant and gives the resistance, as constant value, static resistance.<br>
* If the resistance of a resistor changes as the voltage increases, 
the resistor is a non-ohmic resistor.<br>
 So if you draw a graph of voltage against current the curve is not linear, 
but some curvy shape.<br>
 The slope of the curve at a particular voltage shows the resistance 
only at that voltage.<br>
 Non-ohmic resistors include tungsten light bulb filament, diode, thermistor.<br>
* Is the resistance of a non-ohmic conductor the ratio of the voltage to current at the applied voltage, or the inverse slope of the current voltage 
 graph at the applied voltage?<br>
 The equation R = V / I is not a statement of Ohm's law.<br>
 It is the definition of resistance that applies equally to ohmic and
non-ohmic conductors.<br>
For the non-ohmic conductor whose I-V curve is shown in the diagram above, the resistance of the conductor, when the applied voltage is 
 V<sub>0</sub>, is V<sub>0</sub> / I<sub>0</sub>.<br>
 The conductor is described as non-ohmic, because its resistance, V<sub>0</sub> 
/ I<sub>0</sub>, varies with applied voltage.<br>
 Even pure copper is non-ohmic if current is above 1 KA per cm<sup>2</sup>.<br>
 A conductor is described as ohmic, i.e. obeying Ohm's law, if its resistance 
is independent of the applied voltage.<br>
 Note the slope of the I-V curve at the applied voltage, i.e. V / I.<br>
 It is called the dynamic resistance, or a-c resistance, of the conductor 
at this voltage.<br>
 It has significance in describing the dynamic I-V characteristics of 
electronic devices.<br>
 However, it is not correct to describe it as the "resistance" of the
conductor.<br>
Experiment<br>
<a href="/images/32.3.1.3b.gif">See diagram: 32.3.1.3b</a>: Non-ohmic resistor experiment circuit<br>
1. Use a 12 volt, 6 lamp and a 15 ohm, 10 watt resistor.<br>
 Apply 12 volts in the circuit and calculate the resistance of the lamp 
at its running temperature.<br>
 Increase the voltage and record the current.<br>
 Plot the voltage-current of the lamp.<br>
 Replace the lamp with the resistor and record the current at the same

2. The resistance of a tungsten filament in an
incandescent light bulb is temperature dependent.<br>
 Turn on a 100 watt light bulb in a lamp socket, fixed vertically over 
the socket.<br>
 Leave it turned until too hot to touch.<br>
 Unplug the lamp and use an ohmmeter to measure the resistance of the
filament every 5 seconds as it cools.<br>
 Assuming that the resistance varies linearly with temperature, plot the 
filament temperature as a function of time as it cooled.<br>
 In a 75 watt or 100 watt 120 volt light bulb, the filament temperature
 is about 2550<sup> o</sup>C and has a resistance of about 144 ohms and 
 draws 0.33 amps.<br>
 The "cold resistance" is about 10 ohms.<br>
3. Ohmic and non-ohmic resistivity of "Play-Doh", 
 a modelling compound for children.<br>
 Play-Doh contains, among other ingredients, a starch-based substance, 
 sodium chloride, petroleum additive, borax and a colorant.<br>
 Red coloured Play-Doh exhibits ohmic resistivity up to about 1 volt potential 
difference, then non-ohmic resistivity.<br>
 Drill holes in the side a of a plastic tube filled with red Play-Doh 
and attach electrode to the ends.<br>
 As voltage and current is increased in the circuit the voltage drop across 
two voltmeter probes inserted in a measure distance in the 
 Play-Doh.<br>
 Voltages from 0.1V to 1.0V produce found resistivity of about 0.2 Ωm, 
including a change in resistivity when it become non-ohmic.<br>
 Time may be a factor if the Play-Doh becomes dry.<br>

Experiment<br>
 Connect a little electric motor to a large 1.5 volt dry cell.<br>
 Use a rheostat to make your motor start slowly, come up to full speed 
and then slow down.<br>
 As the copper wire is moved nearer to C, you make the electron current 
to flow through more of the jug element and meet more 
 resistance.<br>
 Thus the voltage of the battery cannot push electrons around the circuit

 Copper wire, 18 SWG, bare, 1.22 mm diameter, 0.0418 Ohm / m.<br>
 Nichrome wire, 32 SWG, bare, 0.274 mm diameter, 18.4 Ohm / m.<br>
 Resistivity symbol is ρ, (Greek <i>ρ</i> rho), and the unit is ohm metres.<br>
 If resistance, R, of a wire length, L, and cross-section area, a m<sup>2</sup>, 
R = rho × (L / a).<br>
Resistivity<br>
 The resistance wire Constantan (Eureka wire) has a high volume resistivity 
and almost negligible temperature coefficient.<br>
 Resistivity depends on the material, but resistance depends on the nature 
of the material, its length and its cross-section area.<br>
 Resistivity in ohm metres of conductors = 10<sup>-8 </sup>to 10<sup>-6</sup>, 
semiconductors = 10<sup>-6 </sup>to 10<sup>-1</sup>, insulators 10<sup>7 </sup>to
10<sup>23</sup>.<br>
 Resistivity is the reciprocal of conductivity.<br>
 In semiconductors, the higher the level of doping, the lower the resistivity.<br>
 An A C battery, 3 V flashlight bulb, and a copper wire coil make a hand 
held temperature coefficient of resistivity apparatus.<br>
 Resistance changes with temperature.<br>
If resistance changes with temperature, a wire with resistance R<sub>0</sub>at temperature T<sub>0</sub>, then resistance R at temperature T = 
 R<sub>0</sub>+ aR<sub>0</sub>(T - T<sub>0</sub>), where "a" = temperature coefficient of resistance.<br>
Experiment<br>
1. To observe resistivity with metre wire bridge set up as in diagram 32.2.60 except substitute for R1 a material, e.g. a wire, of known length and 
cross-section area.<br>
Measure the resistance of length I cm of the specimen taking care that on interchanging the specimen R, and known resistance R2, 
the same length I cm of the specimen is exposed between the terminals in each case.<br>
 Tie small knots in the wire near each end and ensure that these knots 
just emerge from the terminals in each case.<br>
 Measure the length I cm of the specimen under test with a metre rule.<br>
 Use a micrometer screw gauge to measure its diameter d cm at four different places.<br>
As in 32.2.60 for determining the resistance R, of the specimen, the resistance of a wire, is proportional to its length l, and inversely proportional 
 to its cross-section area A, so resistance R is proportional to length l / area A.<br>
 So R = rho X (l / A), where rho is a constant called the resistivity of the material.<br>
 So rho = (RA) / l ohm cm.<br>
2. To measure temperature coefficient of resistance of material with a metre wire bridge, insert the thermometer through the cork and wind the specimen 
 in a coil round the stem of the thermometer keeping the turns separate.<br>
 Tie the coil to the thermometer with thread.<br>
 Connect the ends of the coiled specimen to copper wire leads.<br>
 Record this temperature t<sub>1</sub><sup>o</sup>C after heating for ten minutes when the temperature of the coil becomes constant, and measure the 
 balance point AB and DC.<br>
 Heat the beaker plus contents for 10 minutes, record the temperature of the coil, t<sub>2</sub><sup>o</sup>C, measure the new balance point AB<sub>2 
</sub>and B<sub>2</sub>C.<br>
 Electrical resistance of a material varies with temperature.<br>
 For metals, over small ranges of temperature, the variation is regular.<br>
 If resistance of a metal wire is R<sub>0 </sub>at 0<sup>o</sup>C, and 
R<sub>t</sub>, at temperature t<sup>o</sup>C, R<sub>t </sub>= R<sub>0</sub>(1 + at) where "a" is a constant called the temperature 
 coefficient of resistance.<br>
 So Rt<sub>1 </sub>= R<sub>0</sub>(1 + at<sub>1</sub>), and Rt<sub>2</sub> = R<sub>0</sub>(1 + at<sub>2</sub>).<br>
 So Rt<sub>1</sub> / Rt<sub>2 </sub>= (1 + at<sub>1</sub>) / (1 + at<sub>2</sub>).<br>
 Rt<sub>1 </sub>= R<sub>2</sub>(AB<sub>1</sub>) / (B<sub>1</sub>C) ohms.<br>
 Rt<sub>2 </sub>= R<sub>2</sub>(AB<sub>2</sub> / (B<sub>2</sub>C) ohms.<br>

A thermistor is a small piece of semiconducting material the resistance of which falls with increasing temperature.<br>
It can be used for sensitive temperature measurement and control.<br>
 The resistance decreases when heated or when current passes through 
it causing heat.<br>
 So an incandescent globe may turn on at higher temperature when resistance 
in the circuit is less.<br>
 Thermistors are wires used in electronic circuits made of metal oxides that decrease in resistance when the temperature of the wire increases.<br>

1. A thermistor, thermal resistor, is a semiconductor 
 made of Co, Ni, Mn oxides and copper powder.<br>
 Its resistance is very sensitive to temperature.<br>
 When the thermistor is cold, a current of 25 mA will not be detected 
by the ammeter.<br>
 Heat the thermistor very carefully with a Bunsen burner and the current 
rises.<br>
 Stop heating when the current reaches 0.3 amps.<br>
2. To show that materials change their conductivity,

In electromagnetism and electronics, electromotive force, emf, measured in volts, is an electrical action caused by any non-electrical source.<br>
The volt is the standard unit of electromotive force, emf, (voltage).<br>
An emf of 1 volt (1 V) across a component of a circuit with resistance 1 ohm drives a current of 1A through that component.<br>
An electric current flows through a conductor, only if there is a potential difference, V, across it.<br>
The source of the potential difference is the electromotive force, emf, measured in volts.<br>
1. Electromotive force, emf, measured in volts, provides a potential difference across a conductor and causes an electric current to flow through 
the conductor.<br>
Sources of emf include batteries, generators, photocells and thermocouples.<br>
When a potential difference across a conductor produces an electric field that pushes on charges that force them to move and cause current flow, 
the direction of the electric field is from higher potential to lower potential.<br>
Show direction of current as the direction of the electric field in the conductor.<br>
By convention, current goes from higher potential to lower potential.<br>
In liquids and gases that conduct electricity, positive charges move in the direction of the electric field and negative charges move in the opposite 
direction to the electric field.<br>
In metals and vacuum tubes only electrons (negative charges) move, and they move in the opposite direction to the electric field.<br>
Although the current starts moving around a circuit almost instantaneously, the charges move slowly, e.g. electrons in a current of five amps through 
a copper wire move at about 0.5 mm per second, yet in the vacuum of a cathode ray tube the electrons can move at 3 × 10<sup>7 </sup>metres per second.<br>

<a href="/images/32.2.56d.gif">See diagram 32.2.56</a>: The emf of a cell.<br>
 Experiment<br>
 The emf, E volts, of a cell is the potential difference between its terminals, when the circuit is open.<br>
 The resistance of the voltmeter is high so little current passes through it.<br>
 When the switch is closed, the voltmeter reads V volts, i.e. less than E volts.<br>
 V is the potential difference needed to cause the current I amps to flow through the resistance external to the cell, mainly the rheostat Rh.<br>
 (E - V) volts = potential difference required for the current I amps to flow through the internal resistance r of the cell.<br>
 So I = (E - V) / r or r = (E - V) / I.<br>
 With the switch S open, record the reading E volts on the voltmeter across the cell C, e.g. Daniell cell.<br>
 Close the switch and adjust the rheostat to give a small current I amps and V volts on the voltmeter.<br>
 Adjust the rheostat Rh to get five pairs of current I amps, and potential difference V volts.<br>
 Calculate R = V / I for each pair of readings of readings.<br>
 Calculate the internal resistance of the cell r = (E -V) / I.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="32.4.6.6.2H"></a>32.4.6.6.2 emf of two cells with a potentiometer<br>
 See: <a href="Commercial3.html#PotentiometersH">Potentiometers</a>, (Commercial).<br>
 A potentiometer is a length of resistance wire AC of uniform cross-section with a terminal at each end, and a graduated scale.<br>
A potentiometer is a three-terminal resistor with a sliding or rotating contact that forms an adjustable voltage divider.<br>
 If only two terminals are used, one end and the wiper, it acts as a variable resistor or rheostat.<br>
<a href="/images/32.2.56d.gif">See diagram 32.2.56</a>: Potentiometer.<br>
 Experiment<br>
 1. When a current flows through the resistance wire there is a steady
fall in potential from A to C.<br>
 So the difference in potential between two places on the resistance 
wire is proportional to the distance between them.<br>
<a href="/images/32.2.58d.gif">See diagram 32.2.58</a>: Two accumulator cells and another cell.<br>
 2. Use two accumulator cells, and a Leclanché cell, carbon electrode 
positive (dry cell) at L.<br>
 Put a resistor as a protective shunt across a sensitive centre zero galvanometer 
G.<br>
 Close switch S.<br>
 Touch the potentiometer wire with the sliding contact near A then touch 
near C to check that the galvanometer G deflections are be in 
 opposite directions.<br>
 If not, adjust the rheostat Rh to increase the current through the circuit.<br>
 Move the sliding contact to a point B1 on the resistance wire where the 
galvanometer shows no deflection.<br>
 Disconnect the shunt across the galvanometer to make it more sensitive 
and measure the distance AB1 more accurately.<br>
 3. Use two accumulator cells, and a Daniell cell (copper electrode positive) 
at D.<br>
 Replace the shunt across the galvanometer.<br>
 Move the sliding contact to a point B2 on the resistance wire where the 
galvanometer shows no deflection. Measure AB2.<br>
When the galvanometer shows no deflection, no current is supplied by the cell at C2, that circuit is an open circuit and the potential difference between 
 A and B is equal to the emf of the cell.<br>
 The emf E1 of the Leclanché cell is proportional to AB1.<br>
 The emf E2 of the Daniell cell is proportional to AB2.<br>
 So (emf E1) / (emf E2) = AB1 / AB2.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="32.4.6.7H"></a>32.4.6.7 Internal resistance of a cell<br>
See: <a href="Commercial.html#VoltmetersH">Voltmeters</a> (Commercial).<br>
The terminal potential difference, voltage, of a cell when it causes current I to flow is related to its electromotive force, emf, and its internal 
 resistance r, so the potential difference across each cell in series = (emf - Ir).<br>
Total emf = (emf<sub>1 </sub>+ emf<sub>2 </sub>+ emf<sub>3</sub>) - (Ir<sub>1 </sub>+ Ir<sub>2 </sub>+ Ir<sub>3</sub>).<br>
Terminal voltage (terminal potential difference)<br>
When a battery produces current, i.e. discharges, terminal voltage, V = (emf) - (voltage drop in internal resistance), 
V = emf - Ir<br>
When a battery is receiving current, charging, terminal voltage V = (emf) + (voltage drop in internal resistance), 
V = emf + r.<br>
Experiment<br>
 1.<a href="/images/32.2.58d.gif">See diagram 32.2.58</a>: Two accumulator cells and another cell.<br>
 To measure the internal resistance of a cell with a potentiometer, put 
a resistor as a protective shunt across a galvanometer G.<br>
 Close switch S1.<br>
 With switch S2 open, measure the balance point B1 on the potentiometer
 wire AC,<br>
* with the protective shunt,<br>
* without the protective shunt.<br>
 Record AB1.<br>
 Put a resistor as a protective shunt across a galvanometer G.<br>
 Close switch S1.<br>
 With R = 5 ohms and S2 closed, measure the new balance point AB2.<br>
 Record AB2.<br>
 With R = 4 ohms and with S2 closed, measure the balance point AB3.
 2. Repeat with R = 3 ohms.<br>
 Repeat with R = 2 ohms.<br>
 E = I(R + r), E is the emf of the cell D and r the internal resistance
 of cell D.<br>
 V = IR, where V is the PD between the terminals of D when it is sending 
current through R.<br>
 So E / V = + r) / R, r = (E - V) / V × R.<br>
 AB1 is proportional to E and AB2 is proportional to V,<br>
 So r = (AB1 - AB2) / AB2 × R ohms.<br>

<a href="/images/32.4.6.9.gif">See diagram 32.4.6.9</a>: Model electric lamp.<br>
 Experiment<br>
 1. Push the ends of two pieces of copper wire, 16 swg, through a cork 
in a small bottle.<br>
 Connect the ends of the copper wire inside the bottle with a stand of
steel wool.<br>
 Connect this model electric lamp model in a circuit with one or more dry 
cells, or lead cell accumulators, and a switch.<br>
 Close the switch until the fine wire filament begins to glow.<br>
 At first the heated iron wire produces light, but soon the iron combines 
with the oxygen of the air inside the bottle and burns.<br>
 Examine a manufactured lamp bulb.<br>
 It contains no oxygen.<br>
 It has a tungsten carbide wire filament that may be heated to a high
temperature so that it glows without burning.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="35.33.0H"></a>35.33.0 Piezoelectricity with red lead and sulfur<br>
 Demonstrate piezoelectricity by dusting then cooling or warming crystal with a dust of red lead and sulfur that has passed through a silk or nylon screen.<br>
 A simple bellows can be made from a plastic nasal spray or deodorant bottle in that the aperture has been enlarged to allow a sizeable 
 spray to be emitted.<br>
 Place in the bottle a mixture of about 2 parts red lead to 1 part sulfur.<br>
 Put a small piece of silk or nylon stocking over the mouth of the bottle.<br>
 Tighten this with a rubber band.<br>
 The dust particles receive electric charges as they pass through the
screen formed by the stocking.<br>
 They settle on the end of the crystal that attracts them.<br>
 The red lead gets a positive charge and goes to the negative end of the 
crystal.<br>
 The sulfur gets a negative charge and settles on the positive end of
the crystal.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="35.33.1H"></a>35.33.1 Pyroelectricity, ferroelectricity<br>
The minerals tourmaline and quartz have pyroelectric properties, i.e. electricity is generated when the crystal is heated and opposite charges gather<br>
on the opposite faces of asymmetric crystals.<br>
So the heated crystals generate electricity.<br>
Temperature or pressure changes cause such minerals to get an electric charge when they are warmed or cooled or pressed.<br>
Other substances are pyroelectric, but are termed ferroelectric, because the direction of charge changes if external electric fields are applied, e.g. gallium nitrate (GaN) and lithium tantalate (LiTaO3).<br>
