<a href="./appendices/appendixF.html#AgroclavineH">Agroclavine</a> |
Sweet potato, (Sweetpotato), <i>Ipomoea batatas</i>, Convolvulaceae, is a climbing herbaceous perennial vine, alternate palmately lobed leaves, sympetalous trumpet-shaped purple flowers,<br>edible tuberous root with smooth skin, colour n yellow to orange to red brown to purple, tuber flesh white to yellow to purple.<br>
It comes from South America, but is now grown very widely in many tropical and temperate countries, e.g. USA, and is now grown in South West Asia.<br>
It is the chief food crop in Papua New Guinea and is very important in the Solomon Islands and New Hebrides.<br>
In Papua New Guinea it is called kau kau, in Fiji it is called kumara and in some Polynesian islands it is called kumala.<br>
It produces starchy underground tubers and young green leaves which can be soaked and eaten.<br>
It can live for years, but it usually harvested after about 3 months, before it can flower.<br>
The biological relatives are th tropical creepers, e.g. the Morning Glory, <i>Convolvulus</i> sp., Convolvulaceae.<br>
There are many different varieties producing tubers with different tastes and yields.<br>
It is probably easier to grow than any other food plant and it does not suffer from many diseases.<br>
They are dependable, will always give a crop and are very quick in growth, with some varieties giving a crop in 3 tor 4 months.<br>
Uses<br>
Sweet potato is used as an important food crop after, steaming, boiling, frying, baking.<br>
The tubers can be cut into small pieces and dried in the sun to keep for a long time, and can be ground into flour.<br>
The tubers and leaves can also be fed to pigs even if they infected with the sweet potato weevil.<br>
The leaves and excess growth can be added to the compost.<br>
It may be grown just as a colonizing ground cover on poor soils to keep soil moisture high and add organic matter.<br>
It may be used to function as a living mulch to keep the weeds down.<br>
Climate<br>
The sweet potato grows well in warm, sunny and humid regions, but it can grow well in dry savanna country.<br>
It grows well in temperatures of 24<sup>o</sup>C or more with plenty of sunlight and warm nights.<br>
The plants will not grow well when the temperature is below 10<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
Sweet potatoes will grow well in many situations from those that are wet to those that are dry.<br>
At sea level it can grow well, and some varieties can grow at over 1500 metres.<br>
Soil<br>
Sweet potato grows best in a light, well-drained, sandy loam containing rotten plant material, but useful crops can be grown in poor soils.<br>
If the soil containing too much organic matter and high in nitrogen, e.g. chicken manure, it will produces too many stems and leaves, and few tubers.<br>
The pH of soil should be 5.7 to 6.7.<br>
Rainfall<br>
Sweet potato needs regular rain to grow well, especially when the leaves are starting to grow about 50 days after planting.<br>
It requires a well distributed rainfall of 75 -150 cm for good production.<br>
However, but too much rain may damage the plants and at harvest time it may cause tuber rot.<br>
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="2.0H"></a>2.0 Leaves<br>
<a href="./images/61.2.gif">See diagram 61.2:</a> Leaf shapes.<br>
Leaves of different varieties vary greatly in size and shape<br>
The leaf shape may be entire, i.e. have no lobes, but are just one shape, or heart- shaped, or deeply divided with 3, 5 or 7 mostly pointed-shape lobes.<br>
The long thin petioles and leaf veins are green to red in colour.<br>
The leaves of sweet potatoes have a long thin leaf stalk or petiole.<br>
Experiment.<br>
Collect sweet potato leaves of different shapes.<br>
Trace the outline of 3 leaves of different shapes on to paper.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="3.0H"></a>3.0 Stems<br>
The stem of the sweet potato plant is thin, bends easily, has little lumps along it called nodes, like knots.<br>
The leaves are attached to its younger parts.<br>
Where leaves drop off, a leaf scar remains.<br>
Buds on the stem are just above the position of each leaf scar.<br>
Every fifth leaf is directly in line with another leaf below it.<br>
If a piece of stem is buried, new leaves will grow from the buds above the ground and roots will grow from the stem below the ground.<br>
When a stem grows over the surface of the soil, some roots may grow down from some nodes that are touching the soil.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="4.0H"></a>4.0 Tubers<br>
<a href="./images/61.4.gif">See diagram 61.4:</a> Sweet potato tuber.<br>
<a href="61.13.jpg">See diagram 61.13:</a> Sweet potato tuber with shoots and roots.<br>
<a href="61.14.jpg">See diagram 61.14:</a> Sweet potato tuber with shoots and roots.<br>
Tubers are produced when the roots spreading out from the planting material turn down into the soil and accumulate food reserves.<br>
The "crown" end may produce shoots.<br>
An outer periderm may produce secondary roots.<br>
The tubers of sweet potatoes vary greatly in size, weighing between 0.3 and 3 kg, shape and colour of the flesh and of the skin.<br>
The most common varieties have long spindle-shaped tubers, but other varieties have nearly round or nearly oval tubers.<br>
The outside of the tuber has small pits on it with a bud at the bottom of each pit, which can grow out into a secondary roots.<br>
Tubers with smooth shapes are preferred, because tubers with long grooves in them are difficult to peel without wasting a lot of flesh.<br>
The colour of the skin and of the flesh may be white, cream, yellow or purple, with dark orange varieties containing beta carotene.<br>
Some tubers are very good to eat, with a pleasant and feel good in the mouth.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="5.0H"></a>5.0 Flowers<br>
<a href="./images/61.5.gif">See diagram 61.5</a>: Sweet potato flower.<br>
Flowers, usually violet, purple, white, are clustered in the leaf axils.<br>
They are formed singly or in small clusters in the axils of the leaves.<br>
The 5 petals are joined to make a tube.<br>
The 5 small green sepals are under the petals.<br>
Seeds are contained in a small capsule that splits open when it is ripe, to release 2 to 4 small brown or black seeds with sharp corners.<br>
The seeds are not usually used for sowing sweet potatoes.<br>
Many varieties of sweet potato in cultivation do not have time to produce flowers and fruits before the harvest.<br>
Experiment<br>
Collect some flowers and seeds.<br>
Describe the colour of the flowers an seeds in the seed capsules and draw them.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="6.0H"></a>6.0 Planting material<br>
See diagram 61.6: Methods of planting, Planting material.<br>
Cuttings<br>
Propagation from cuttings is the quickest and easiest way, and most economic way, of increasing sweet potato plants.<br>
However, propagation from cuttings is possible only when an established vines of sweet potatoes remain in the field all through the year.<br>
1. The most common planting method is to plant tip cuttings.<br>
Cut a piece of stem, 20 to 40 centimetres long, with three to five growth buds, and taken from the tips of young stems.<br>
Remove all the leaves except for the tiny leaves at the very tip.<br>
Plant the cutting by covering almost the whole length with soil, leaving only the leaves of the tip should sticking out of the ground.<br>
Take the cuttings only when you are ready to plant them, and keep them in the shade until they are inserted in the soil.<br>
In warmer climates, plant the cuttings runners straight into the prepared soil, then water in well.<br>
In cooler climates, plant the cuttings into pots, water in well, and keep the pots in a warm place, e.g. a sunny windowsill.<br>
2. Use pieces of stem and leaves from the middle part of the stem.<br>
The best pieces of stem to use for planting have a new shoot growing in a leaf axil.<br>
Leave stem cuttings for a week until the leaves have died, then plant the stem piece.<br>
3. Leave a bundle of stem cuttings in the shade and covered with grass or banana leaves to make roots growing out from the covered nodes.<br>
4. Cut off around 4 cm just above a leaf at the tip of a vine, remove the lower leaves and place in water until roots appear.<br>
Slips<br>
Slips are shoots that are grown from a mature sweet potato tuber, which can be planted 40-60 cm apart.<br>
1. Keep tubers in weak light in the shade until they start to sprout and cut off pieces of the tuber with the attached shoots then plant the pieces.<br>
2. When the shoots are 15 -20 cm in length, they can be broken off the tuber and planted.<br>
3. Cut a clean healthy tuber in half and place in water, half out of the water and half submerged, or half bury a tuber in moist sand or potting mix.<br>
Keep the half tuber in a warm place until shoots begin to grow above and roots begin to grow below.<br>

<a href="./images/61.6.gif">See diagram 61.6:</a> Methods of planting, Planting material<br>
1. Use pieces of stem and leaves from the middle part of the stem.<br>

4. Keep tubers in weak light in the shade until they start to sprout.<br>
Cut off pieces of the tuber with the shoots attached to them, then plant the pieces.<br>
5. When the shoots are long enough, 15 -20 cm in length, they can be broken off the tuber and planted.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="7.0H"></a>7.0 Planting sweet potato<br>
<a href="./images/61.7.gif">See diagram 61.7:</a> Sweet potato gardens, Ridges, Mounds.<br>
The sweet potato grower should know the varieties and know how long they take to form tubers, and be harvested.<br>
If planting several times, at intervals, all the tubers do not become ready for harvest at the same time, so they can be harvested only when needed.<br>
1. Planting on the flat<br>
The garden is prepared by digging up the soil, burying weeds, and making the soil loose.<br>
This method of planting is not used very much, because it does not make good drainage.<br>
2. Planting inn ridges 25-30 cm height and 60 cm apart or in moulded beds 30 cm apart<br>
Ridges may be made by hand or by ploughs which throw up the earth up into ridges of loose soil that allow for good drainage.<br>
3. Planting on mounds<br>
The best method of planting is to form small mounds and plant the cuttings into the top of the mounds.<br>
The mounds can be made by hand or be formed from ridges first made by a plough.<br>
A mound may 25 to 90 cm wide across the top and be heaped up until 15 to 40 cm high.<br>
Well-buried plant material may make the soil loose and warm that will help the sweet potatoe plants to grow better.<br>
4. Use cuttings cut about 20 cm from the growing tip of the runner.<br>
Trim all the leaves off except for the two small emerging leaves.<br>
or<br>
Make cuttings from 25-30 cm pieces of stem that have 5 nodes and to bury the bottom 3 nodes and leave 2 of them above ground.<br>
Plant the cuttings 40-60 cm apart, buried horizontally.<br>
5. The depth of planting cuttings<br>
In some places cuttings are buried 30 cm deep, but in other places they are only buried 6 cm deep.<br>
Planting too deep makes it too hard to harvest the tubers.<br>
Some people plant the cuttings so they are straight up in the soil.<br>
Some people plant the cuttings so they are at an angle of 30<sup>o</sup> or 60<sup>o</sup> to level.<br>
Some people plant the cuttings so that the bottom part of the cutting is buried horizontally and the top part is bent upwards.<br>
6. Usually more than one cutting is planted at each planting hole.<br>
Planting 2 to 5 cuttings in one place on a mound is usual.<br>
Plant a new row every week to get a continuous supply.<br>
Dig a sweet potato garden, planting 3 cuttings in each mound.<br>
Use cuttings that have 5 nodes and plant them so the bottom 3 nodes are under the soil and 2 are above the soil.<br>
7. The soil should be pH 5.5-6.5, with good levels of potassium and phosphorus to maximize tuber size.<br>
Ridges and mounds<br>
Sweet potatoes are usually grown on ridges or mounds after deep tilling, protect them from too much moisture, so better than growing on the flat<br>
The ridges are made about 75 cm apart, but it is better to plant on round mounds 30 to 40 cm high, 1 m apart.<br>
Mounds should be as narrow as possible to forces the plant to bend its roots downward quickly, build up food reserves and develop tubers.<br>
Planting sweet potato<br>
The best way to control pests and diseases is to always plant sweet potato in new ground and use clean planting material.<br>
Prepare soil for sweet potato and plant it.<br>
1. On light sandy soil plant into ridges one metre apart.<br>
2. On heavy clay soils plant into mounds.<br>
The soil must be well drained.<br>
Select cuttings about 50 cm long from the growing tips of healthy plants, which are producing large tubers.<br>
Some people cut back old vines near the roots and later use the new shoots for cuttings.<br>
Make ridges by digging trenches one metre apart, put in rotten plant material, plant ashes, potash or a low nitrogen fertilizer, e.g. NPK 5.10.10 or NPK 6:9:15.<br>
Then hill up over the filled furrow.<br>
The soil should be light and fine with no clods, sticks or stones in it.<br>
Plant the cutting five cm deep, three nodes underground, 50 cm apart.<br>
If you plant two rows on each ridge most of the ground will be covered to control weeds, but tubers will be smaller than if planting only one row.<br>
Press down around each cutting with the foot.<br>
The soil should be damp when planting.<br>
Mulching will keep the soil damp and protect the ridges from erosion.<br>
The soil should not be very dry just, because harvested tubers can be attacked by the sweet potato weevil.<br>
Village people have learned many interesting ways to grow sweet potato and you should learn your local method.<br>
However, you should also experiment with new methods, e.g. dry season planting.<br>
Use some clean cuttings.<br>
Draw a diagram to show how to make ridges and where to plant them.<br>
Show how to hill up the soil to make ridges.<br>
Show how to select plant cuttings.<br>
Show how to plant cuttings in the ridges.<br>
You may then use mulch to keep the soil damp.<br>
Make mounds.<br>
Build up heaps of rotten plant material and wood ash.<br>
Cover the heaps with soil to make a round mound about one metre across and half a metre high.<br>
Plant four cuttings around the top of the mound.<br>
Planting<br>
Plant cuttings at a slant, leaving 3 or 4 cm above ground, and press the soil down firmly.<br>
If planting on mounds, plant four or five cuttings in a circle on each mound, to give a planting density of 15 000 to 30 000 plants per hectare.<br>
Propagate from tubers, if you do not have any plants of sweet potatoes with enough leafy growth to provide cuttings.<br>
Tubers must be made to sprout in a cool nursery bed.<br>
If the tubers are large, cut them into several pieces.<br>
After about a month, remove from the tubers the young shoots that are 15 to 20 centimetres long and plant them.<br>
This method of propagation from tubers is usually done only on about one third of the area of the sweet potatoes field.<br>
Later, cuttings from the plants thus obtained can be used to enlarge the plantation.<br>
When cultivating, remake the mounds at the same time.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="8.0H"></a>8.0 Crop care<br>
1. Use hand weeding to pull out all the weeds every two weeks after planting and burn the weeds when dry.<br>
For control of weeds, one or two cultivations in the early stages of growth are enough, because 4 to 6 weeks after planting, the plant's own leafy growth will closely cover the soil.<br>
2. Water the plants if the soil becomes dry, but if heavy rains wash away soil, hill up ridges with a hoe.<br>
3. Lift the vines to prevent secondary roots growing.<br>
4. Look for pests and diseases.<br>
If you find anything attacking the sweet potato put the pest or disease and the part of the plant in methylated spirits.<br>
The caterpillars of the hawk moth and the leaf miner moth will eat the leaves.<br>
The sweet potato weevil walks down cracks in dry ground to eat the tubers.<br>
The vine scab disease forms spots on the tips of stems.<br>
Rats will try to eat the tubers.<br>
5. Prepare for harvest<br>
Harvest when the leaves turn yellow
Feel the size of some tubers in the ground, then feel the size the following weeks.<br>
Weigh some sample developing tubers.<br>
The tubers are ready to harvest when the skin of the tubers is firm, when a cut piece turns creamy white, not greenish black around the edges, or have a white juice that turns black.<br>
Dig out the tubers with a stick or a fork, not a spade which will cut them.<br>
Dry them in the sun and store in a cool dry place.<br>
Leave the tubers in the ground to harvest only when you need them or cut off the vines at ground level and dig up the lot.<br>
Burn all the cut vines to kill all the pests and diseases on them.<br>
Growth studies<br>
<a href="./images/61.8.gif">See diagram 61.8:</a> Sweet potato diary.<br>
Keep records of the growth of the crop.<br>
1. Note how many stems come from each cutting.<br>
2. Note how fast do the stems grow, i.e. what length of stem is grown each day.<br>
3. Note when the tubers start to form by uncovering the roots of one plant each week.<br>
The normal life of the plant is 4-5 months at sea level, but 5-6 months if planted high up in the mountains.<br>
4. Note when the tubers have formed properly and the plant is near the end of its years growth.<br>
At this stage some leaves may turn yellow.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="9.0H"></a>9.0 Fertilizers<br>
This earthy vegetable likes crumbly, loose soil, well composted with organic matter, which helps create a loose, permeable, healthy bed.<br>
Sweet potatoes grow best in a sandy loam (approx. proportions sand 53%, silt 43%, and clay 7%) preferably at temperatures above 24 C.<br>
Although they need water, do not soak the soil, because sweet potato can rot in damp conditions.<br>
Sweet potatoes respond well to fertilizers, especially if containing nitrogen and potassium.<br>
The fertilizers to use are as follows:<br>
1. Ammonium sulfate or urea or IBDU.<br>
2. Chloride of potash or sulfate of potash.<br>
Do not add too much of them or it will burn the plants.<br>
Use about one matchbox full of mixed fertilizer and spread it over one square metre.<br>
Do not put the fertilizer too close to the plants.<br>
Sprinkle it over the ground, but keep it 10 cm away from the plants and dig it lightly into the soil.<br>
3. Trim excess growth to increase the size of the tubers.<br>

<a href="61.15.jpg">See diagram 61.15:</a> Tuber damaged by Sweet potato weevil 1.<br>
Sweet potato weevil, <i>Cylas formicarius</i> in beetle family Brentidae is the most serious pest of sweet potato, causing damage in field and storage.<br>
It is found in Australia, the South Pacific and many other countries, and is widespread in Queensland, with losses up to 97%.<br>
The West Indian sweet potato weevil, <i>Euscepes postfasciatus</i> is found in North America.<br>
A complete life cycle occurs in 35 to 40 days and all stages can be found during the year in sweet potato tubers.<br>
During winter adults may seek shelter and remain inactive until the weather is favourable.<br>
The only vegetable crop they feed on is sweet potato, but they also feed on Convolvulaceae plants, including railroad vine (<i>Ipomoea pes-caprae</i>), and morning glory (<i>Ipomoea panduratea</i>).<br>
A symptom of infestation is yellowing of the vines, but a heavy infestation is usually necessary before this is noticed, so infestation may be overlooked, because damage is not apparent until harvest.<br>
Adult<br>
The adult body, legs, and head are long and thin, so it looks like an ant, and measures 5.5 to 8.0 mm in length.<br>
It is shiny and smooth, but with short hairs.
The head is black, with an extremely long rostrum (beak).<br>
The antennae, thorax and legs are orange to red-brown, and the abdomen and elytra are metallic blue.<br>
The adult weevils can feed on the leaves, vines, roots and the outside of the tubers.<br>
Adults usually have limited access to tubers, so damage by them is less severe than by larvae and adult feeding on foliage is limited.<br>
However, adults may feed on the tubers, creating many small holes on the outside of the tubers.<br>
An adult weevil is a metallic blue and orange and about 6 mm long.<br>
It eats everything, stems, leaves and roots.<br>
The weevils lay their eggs in the roots and the larvae tunnel through the roots and make a rotten mess of them.<br>
The female weevils chew small holes in the surface of the stems or tubers.<br>
They then lay their eggs in these cavities.<br>
The eggs hatch and a small larva comes out of the egg.<br>
In dry weather, cracks may appear in the soil which allow weevils to go down to the tubers.<br>
Eggs<br>
The soft white eggs are about 0.65 X 0.46 mm and are laid in the root and the larvae burrow through the tubers making a sodden rotten mess.<br>
Larvae<br>
The main form of damage is mining of the tubers by larvae so that the tuber is riddled with dark, spongy cavities.<br>
Also, larvae cause damage indirectly by facilitating entry of soil-borne pathogens.<br>
Even low levels of feeding on the roots may cause a chemical reaction that gives a bitter taste and terpene odour to the tubers, so unmarketable.<br>
Larvae also attack the vine of the plant, causing it to darken, crack, or collapse.<br>
The larvae bore into the stems or tubers.<br>
The larvae have no legs, are white in colour and are about 8 mm long.<br>
If the larvae have been living in the stem, they often go down into the tubers later.<br>
The main form of damage is mining of the tubers by larvae so that the tuber is riddled with dark, spongy cavities.<br>
Also, larvae cause damage indirectly by facilitating entry of soil-borne pathogens.<br>
After 3 weeks the larvae turn into a resting stage called a pupa.<br>
Later the adult weevil comes out of the pupa.<br>
Damage<br>
The edges and the surface of the leaves will appear chewed with small holes and will wilt, dry, or discolour.<br>
The stems may show signs of damage, rotting, and distortion.<br>
Biological Control<br>
Do not plant any more sweet potatoes for at least a year in that place so weevils cannot go from old to new plants and tubers.<br>
Mulching prevents soil cracks, improves soil moisture and provides a habitat for the enemies of the weevil.<br>
Do not leave any tubers in the soil after harvest.<br>
After harvesting all the tubers, pull out all the remaining roots and burn them.<br>
Do not use previous crops for planting material, because it may contain weevils.<br>
Remove alternate wild hosts from near the garden e.g. wild convolvulous vines, carrot roots, and radish roots and leaves.<br>
Use commercial pherome traps or fungal pathogens.<br>
Control using insecticides<br>
Use insecticides containing Diazinon and Carbofuran.<br>
Before planting tubers, slips and cuttings, dip them in an insecticide solution.<br>
Granular or liquid formulations are used, and systemic insecticides are preferred.<br>
Post planting applications may be made to the foliage for adult control, especially if nearby fields are infected.<br>
If systemic insecticide is applied, some suppression of larvae developing in the vine may also occur.<br>
Due to the long duration of the plant growth period, preplant or planting time applications may be followed by mid season applications.<br>
In places where harvested sweet potatoes are stored, the soil can be fumigated.<br>
Fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) is an exotic pest that has been detected in Queensland.<br>
Tubers with weevils in them can be fed to pigs.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="11.0H"></a>11.0 Diseases<br>
To avoid diseases, do not grow sweet potatoes on the same soil for two years in succession.<br>
If sweet potatoes are attacked by diseases and insects, burn any remaining plant material, and wait for years before growing them again in the same field.<br>
Signs of the disease are yellow withered leaves and black marks inside the stems and tubers.<br>
Other fungi may cause the young plant to rot and it stops growing.<br>
To control rot, choose clean resistant varieties, so do not use plants attached by rot for propagation cuttings or tubers.<br>
Sweet potato feathery mottle virus is the most common and widespread virus infecting sweet potato, in most countries where the crop is grown.<br>
The virus can reach high levels of infection in crops propagated from infected material or grown near infected crops, to allow aphid transmission<br>
from crop to crop.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="12.0H"></a>12.0 Harvesting sweet potatoes<br>
Sweet potatoes are ready for harvesting when most of the leaves have turned yellow and have started to fall off the plant.<br>
A tuber is ready for harvest when the juice from a cut with a knife does not go black quickly.<br>
To avoid damaging the tubers, use a small digging tool to start digging from the side of the ridge or mound to first loosen the soil.<br>
Then use your fingers to find the first tubers, so you know their depth in the soil.<br>
Dig carefully to turn over the soil and expose the tubers.

<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="13.0H"></a>13.0 Storing sweet potato tubers<br>
1. The length of time for which sweet potatoes can be kept differs with the varieties and the harvesting season.<br>
If they are harvested in dry weather, the tubers may be stored for 2 or 3 months.<br>
Store only those tubers which are dry, firm to hold with brightly coloured skin, and with no cuts, holes or insect damage.<br>
Store them loose in a cool, dark ventilated place, not in plastic bags and not in a refrigerator.<br>
Do not wash them after harvesting, but keep them dry, and remove dirt with a dry brush to prevent rotting from too much moisture.<br>
Put them on dry ground or on boards supported on posts, and do not heap them up too much.<br>
Wrapping in paper can protect sweet potatoes from fungus or insects.<br>
2. Sweet potato tubers go bad very easily, so storing them for a long time is not usual.<br>
However, there is a way of storing them for short periods, by "curing" them first.<br>
Select only mature tubers with flesh that is white when cut.<br>
Start with air-dried tubers.<br>
Curing is done by giving the tubers a high temperature of 29<sup>o</sup>C and keeping them in moist air for 4 to 7 days.<br>
Keep them in a room for curing, but there must be air flowing through this place.<br>
After about a week of curing, this hardens the skin of the tubers and this keeps out the fungus that makes them go bad.<br>
However, chilling may cause a hard core condition that remains even after cooking.<br>
3. After curing for about a week, put the tubers where it is cool and the temperature is only about 16<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
Temperature below 10<sup>o</sup>C is too cold for the sweet potatoes and they will be damaged.<br>
 In some places the people store the tubers in pits made in the ground in a cool place.<br>
 They may keep them for times up to 4 months in the pits, but usually you can only store them for shorter periods, e.g. 4 weeks.<br>
4. To test if the tubers have been properly cured, the skin of the tubers does not slip easily when pushed, the buds may have a purplish colour,<br>
 the skin looks dry and spongy.<br>

<a href="Foodgardens1.html#1.16H">1.16</a>Records</a><br>
1. Establishment costs are the things you buy, which will probably last for a long time, e.g. spades, hoes, sprays.<br>
Divide the establishment costs by the number of years you think these things will last and you add this amount to the costs, e.g. 3 years.<br>
2. Production costs are things that you must buy each year that you grow the sweet potatoes, e.g. fertilizers and insecticides.<br>
3. Profit = returns - establishment costs - production costs.<br>
Yields of sweet potatoes and storing.<br>
Depending on the varieties of sweet potato and on the way they are grown, yields vary from 4 to 7 tons per hectare on average.<br>
On a modern and well- cared- for plantation, yields may be much higher, and may even be more than 20 tons per hectare.<br>

1. Sweet potato varieties sold in Australia.<br>
Gold varieties: gold skin, orange flesh, Beauregard.<br>
'Beauregard' variety has a gold smooth skin with orange flesh and is a good source of Vitamin A.<br>
<a href="61.11.jpg">See diagram 61.11</a>: 'Beauregard' variety.<br>
'Sweet n Gold' variety is very sweet and has orange to golden flesh, and is probably the most popular variety sold in Australia.<br>
Also, 'Bellevue' and 'Orleans'.<br>
Red varieties: red skin, white flesh.<br>
'Red Garnet' is moist, sweet flavoured, soft textured.<br>
'Northern Star' variety has purple skin with white flesh, is drier than the orange varieties and not as sweet, so suitable for fried chips.<br>
'Kumara' variety has large tubers, red skin and ivory flesh mixed with violet, with small emerald green leaves and dark purple petioles, high levels of<br>
anthocyanins, can be eaten fresh or steamed.<br>
<a href="./images/61.9.jpg">See diagram 61.9</a>: 'Kumara' variety<br><br>
Purple varieties: white skin, purple flesh.<br>
'Sweet n Star' variety has purple skin and pale cream flesh, is less susceptible to attack by soil insects than gold types.<br>
'WSPF' or 'White Skin Purple Flesh' variety has internal purple rings.<br>

White varieties: white skin white flesh.<br>
'Kestle' variety has white skin with white flesh.<br>
2. Where sweet potatoes are grown, there are usually many varieties with local names.<br>
Collect some leaves and tubers of as many varieties and note the features of the different varieties:<br>
| Shape of leaves | Colour of tuber skin | Colour of tuber flesh | Shape of tube | Time to maturity | Taste of cooked tuber.<br>
The main varieties are:<br>
| Dry and starchy | Red or purple, containing anthocyanin | Moist and sweet | Dark orange containing beta carotene (called "yams" in USA)|.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="16.0H"></a>16.0 Food value of sweet potatoes<br>
Eat young sweet potato shoots and leaves in stir fries and salads.<br>
The tubers are full of sugar and starch so they are a good energy food, but they contain a very little protein food.<br>
They are rich in iron and calcium, minerals and in vitamins, e.g. vitamin A.<br>
During cooking, enzymes break down starch to maltose between 60<sup>o</sup>C and 75<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
So slow baking is better than rapid boiling to allow longer enzyme action.<br>
 Some red varieties become dark during cooking caused by phenolic compounds.<br>
 Do some local varieties have special uses, e.g. for babies?<br>
 How do people cook them?<br>
 Do you need to peel them?<br>
 Sweet potato is an important energy food.<br>
 Some varieties are also healthy foods, e.g. red flesh varieties.<br>
 Some varieties are also growth foods if you eat the skins.<br>
 Make sweet potato biscuits.<br>
 Cut tubers into thin slices and dry them in the sun.<br>
 After a few days store the pieces in a tin with a tight lid.<br>
 The pieces can be broken up with a hammer to make flour.<br>
 Mix flour with margarine, baking powder and some milk.<br>
 Roll out dough cut into shapes and bake in hot oven.<br>
 You will need sweet potato leaves and tubers.<br>
Sweet potato in the diet<br>
Sweet potatoes have nutritional value (protein, fibre, Vitamin C and calcium), and a low GI rating.<br>
Both young and mature leaves have significant amounts of Vitamin B6.<br>
Leaves can be added to a stir fry like spinach.<br>
Try frying with garlic for an added boost as they pick up other flavours.<br>
The emerging shoots, tips, stalks and unformed leaves can be eaten in stir fry dishes or salads.<br>
White varieties can be cooked as chips (French fries). boiled or roasted.<br>
Grated sweet potato can be used to thicken soup and curries, and also be used as a filler in cakes, breads and fritters.<br>
Dried sweet potatoes can be made into a flour and used is batters and pancakes.<br>
The sweet potato plant produces starchy underground tubers and young green leaves which can be soaked and eaten.<br>
Sweet potato can be cut into small pieces and dried in the sun.<br>
This will keep a long time and can be ground into flour.<br>
