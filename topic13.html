Clamp the test-tube to a stand.<br> 
Put the solid reagent in the sidearm test-tube and the liquid reagent in the reservoir.<br> 
Add the liquid reagent very slowly drop by drop.<br> 
Keep the reservoir tap closed and the reservoir full to prevent gases blowing back.<br>

 Hydrogen gas, H2, was first discovered by Theophrastus Paracelsus, (1493-1541, Swiss- German), and Robert Boyle (1627-1691, England), who demonstrated the existence of "inflammable air"<br>
 Both chemists used sulfuric acid with iron to make hydrogen gas.<br> 
 In 1766, Henry Cavendish (1731-1810, England), using iron with hydrochloric acid, showed that hydrogen is an element and a constituent of water.<br> 
 Hydrogen gas, both as a compressed gas and a gas generated by experiment is highly flammable and can act as a non-toxic asphyxiant.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.41.1H">3.41.1</a> Lighted splint test for hydrogen gas<br>
 Be careful! A dangerous explosion may occur if you use anything bigger than a small test-tube when igniting the gas, particularly if the gas is mixed with air.<br> 
 Never test more than a test-tube full of hydrogen gas.<br> 
 Never dry hydrogen gas with concentrated sulfuric acid.<br> 
1. Hold a lighted splint or burning taper to the mouth of a test-tube.<br> 
 The gas explodes with a squeaky pop sound.<br> 
 The splint is extinguished.<br> 
 The squeaky pop shows rapid combustion of hydrogen to form water vapour.<br> 
 Look for vapour on the sides of the test-tube.<br> 
 However, as 2 litres of gas forms only about 1 mL of liquid, the liquid on the sides of the test-tube may just show that test-tube was already wet before the experiment.<br>

 Experiments<br>
 1. Prepare hydrogen gas by reaction of an acid on an active metal, e.g. zinc with hydrochloric acid.<br> 
<a href="./images/3.2.33ch.gif">See diagram 3.2.33</a>: Zinc with hydrochloric acid<br>
 Do not use a container bigger than a test-tube.<br> 
 Check that the test-tubes are not chipped or cracked.<br> 
 Put granulated zinc in a small borosilicate test-tube and cover it with water.<br> 
 Add a crystal of copper (II) sulfate to act as a catalyst.<br> 
 The copper sulfate first reacts with zinc in a displacement reaction to form metallic copper, which has a catalytic action.<br> 
 Slowly add dilute hydrochloric acid through a funnel, or through a syringe.<br> 
 Bubbles of hydrogen appear on the surface of the zinc.<br> 
 The test-tube feels hot, because the reaction is exothermic.<br> 
 Use a lighted taper to "pop"' the air / hydrogen mixture.<br> 
 Collect hydrogen gas by downward displacement or over water.<br> 
 Let the reaction continue for some minutes to drive out all the air from the test-tube.<br> 
 Discard the first two test-tubes of hydrogen, because they will contain displaced air.<br> 
 Collect test-tubes of the gas and apply stoppers.<br> 
 Zn (s) + 2HCl (aq)--> ZnCl2 (s) + H2 (g)<br>
2. Prepare hydrogen with iron filings and citric acid or sulfuric acid or sodium hydrogen sulfate<br>
 Put 1 cm depth of iron filings in a test-tube.<br> 
 Just cover the iron filings with a dilute acid solution.<br> 
 Warm the test-tube until frothing starts.<br> 
 Hydrogen is colourless and odourless, but any impurities in the iron filings give a nasty smell.<br> 
 To test for hydrogen gas, remove from heating, place your thumb over the end of the test-tube, count to five, apply a lighted paper to the end of the test-tube, the hydrogen gas explodes with a loud pop sound.<br> 
 Never test more than one test-tube full of hydrogen gas!<br>
 3. Prepare hydrogen with aluminium foil and sodium carbonate<br>
 Cut into small pieces aluminium foil or aluminium milk bottle tops and put them into a test-tube.<br> 
 Add 5 mL of sodium carbonate solution (Na2CO3.10H2O, washing soda).<br> 
 Heat until effervescence occurs.<br> 
4. Prepare hydrogen with calcium and hydrochloric acid<br>
 Use forceps to transfer about 0.1 g of calcium metal turnings to dilute hydrochloric acid in a test-tube.<br> 
 Ca (s) + 2HCl (aq)--> CaCl2 (aq) + H2 (g)<br>
5. Prepare hydrogen with iron filings and potash alum<br>
 Put 5 g of iron filings in a 1 cm depth of alum solution in a test-tube.<br> 
 Heat the solution until effervescence occurs.<br> 
 Potash alum, "alum" has the formula: Al2(SO4)3.K2(SO4).24H2O, also shown as KAl(SO4)2.12H2O.<br> 
6. Prepare hydrogen with iron filings and ammonium chloride<br>
 Put an equal volumes mixture of iron filings and ammonium chloride in a dry test-tube and heat.<br> 
 Hydrogen gas and ammonia are given off.<br> 
7. Prepare hydrogen with aluminium kitchen foil and caustic soda drain cleaner (sodium hydroxide)<br>
 Fill a clear glass bottle one third full with tap water.<br> 
 Do not use a plastic bottle.<br> 
 Cut a plastic bottle, with diameter greater than the glass bottle at half its length, to make a beaker.<br> 
 Half fill the plastic beaker and stand the glass bottle in it.<br> 
 With safety glasses and gloves, use a funnel to add three heaped teaspoons of caustic soda to the water in the glass bottle.<br> 
 Keep the bottle open and swirl the bottle gently without spilling any reagents, then return the bottle to the plastic beaker.<br> 
 The dissolving is exothermic so the contents of the bottle will get hot.<br> 
 Roll three 20 Ã— 30 cm sheets of kitchen aluminium foil into cylinders and then drop them into the bottle.<br> 
 Inflate a 30 cm (helium quality) balloon to stretch the rubber.<br> 
 Deflate the balloon and attach it to the mouth of the bottle, with another person holding the bottle.<br> 
 Swirl the bottle contents again and return the bottle to the plastic beaker.<br> 
 Let the balloon swell to 30 cm diameter then remove from the bottle, with another person holding the bottle, and attach a balloon clip with attached string.<br> 
If the balloon does not rise up when you hold the attached string, either the balloon is not yet at full capacity or the reaction has occurred too quickly, and condensed water vapour inside the balloon is weighing it down.<br> 
 Wash the remaining reagents down the laboratory sink.<br> 
 2Al (s) + 2 NaOH (aq) + 2H2O--> 2NaAlO2 + 3H2 +energy<br>

 Safety<br>
 For these experiments, wear safety goggles, ear protection and have a fire extinguisher close by.<br> 
 Ensure that all ignition of hydrogen occurs at least 2 metres away from any other source of hydrogen, and away from glass light fittings or glass-fronted cabinets.<br> 
 Prepare hydrogen gas by reaction of an acid on an active metal, e.g. zinc with hydrochloric acid.<br> 
 Hydrogen forms spontaneously combustible / explosive mixture in air at low temperature.<br> 
 Hydrogen gas forms explosive mixtures with air when mixed in almost any proportions.<br> 
 Pure hydrogen burns in air with a hot colourless flame without exploding.<br> 
 However, mixtures of hydrogen and oxygen or air burn with explosions.<br>
 In experiments to demonstrate ignition of hydrogen, air / hydrogen mixtures are often ignited instead.<br> 
 For example, when igniting a jet of hydrogen gas from a flask containing metal and acid, sufficient air may be left in the flask to form an explosive mixture so the whole flask explodes, throwing shards of glass in all directions.<br> 
 Exploding soap bubbles containing hydrogen / oxygen mixture on the surface of a beaker of water is safe, if the delivery tube is at least 10 cm below the surface of the water.<br> 
Prepare hdrogen in test-tubes<br>
 Generate small quantities of gas in a test-tube only.<br> 
 There may be some risk associated with popping air / hydrogen mixtures in test-tubes, because the test-tube may shatter.<br> 
 Check that the test-tubes are not flawed.<br> 
 Students may be injured by "popping" (burning) hydrogen in other glass containers.<br> 
 Exploding about 1 mL of hydrogen / air or hydrogen / oxygen mixture is safe, if there is no possibility of broken materials being propelled outwards by the explosion.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.42.1.7H">3.42.1.7</a> Fountain test for hydrogen chloride<br>
 1. This test is similar to the ammonia fountain test.<br> 
 Heat the end of a delivery tube and draw it out to form a fine jet.<br> 
 Fill a flask with hydrogen chloride and close the flask with a one-hole stopper with a delivery tube.<br> 
 Add litmus to alkaline water in a beaker.<br> 
 Warm the flask gently to expand the gas and then hold the flask upside down with the lower end of the delivery tube in alkaline water.<br> 
 Water soon sprays into the flask through the fine jet as the hydrogen chloride gas dissolves in the water, and the pressure of hydrogen chloride in the flask decreases.<br> 
 The litmus in the water changes from blue to red.<br> 
2. Fill a beaker with litmus solution.<br> 
 Fit a glass jet tube into the stopper of a flask.<br> 
 Remove the stopper and jet, and start filling the dry flask with hydrogen chloride.<br> 
 When the flask is full of gas, replace the stopper and jet, and quickly invert the flask with the other end of the jet tube in the litmus solution.<br> 
 With the spirit burner at a safe distance, pour a finger width of methylated spirit on the flask and blow on it.<br> 
 This causes the spirit to evaporate and thereby cool the flask and the gas inside it.<br> 
 The contraction of the gas reduces its pressure, and atmospheric pressure forces litmus solution up the glass tube and out of the jet.<br> 
 The fountain from the jet suddenly increases and the litmus changes colour.<br> 
 The fountain from the jet suddenly increases for the reason given above.<br> 
 The litmus changes from blue to red, because the water in the litmus solutionreacts with the hydrogen chloride to form hydrochloric acid.<br>

 Hydrogen sulfide, Extremely Toxic, Highly flammable<br>
 Hydrogen sulfide, gas, &lt; 1% Not hazardous<br>
 Hydrogen sulfide water, solution, Toxic if ingested<br>
 Hydrogen sulfide gas is both an irritant and an asphyxiant.<br> 
 Collapse, coma and death from respiratory failure may come within a few seconds after one or two inspirations.<br> 
 Do not prepare hydrogen sulfide in an open room.<br> 
 Hydrogen sulfide is extremely toxic so use a fume cupboard.<br> 
 You can ignite a jet of hydrogen sulfide issuing from a delivery tube.<br> 
 Be careful! Hydrogen sulfide is an extremely poisonous colourless flammable gas with an unpleasant smell of rotten eggs.<br> 
 At less than 1% concentration the smell disappears.<br> 
 So a student may be breathing in this poisonous gas without being aware of it.<br> 
 Do NOT use a Kipp's apparatus for generating hydrogen sulfide.<br> 
 Hydrogen sulfide has high acute short-term toxicity to aquatic life, birds, and animals.<br> 
 It is soluble in water and organic solvents and will corrode metals.<br> 
 Hydrogen sulfide is used in the manufacture of pulp and paper (digesting agent), in tanneries and in sulfide ores.<br> 
 It is the main offensive smell in flatus produces after a diet of certain types of beans.<br> 
Experiment<br>
 1. This experiment is regarded as the safest method to prepare hydrogen sulfide gas.<br> 
 Do this experiment in a fume cupboard, fume hood.<br> 
 Prepare only a very small quantity of this gas.<br> 
 Have a beaker full of a weak alkali ready to stop the reaction.<br> 
 Add dilute hydrochloric acid to iron (II) sulfide.<br> 
 Collect the gas over warm water by downward displacement.<br>

 Put 5 sodium thiosulfate crystals in a metal screw cap.<br> 
 Heat the metal screw cap gently by holding it with pincers in a Bunsen burner flame, until the crystals have melted and solidified again with steam given off.<br> 
 Be careful! Do NOT inhale gas directly from the metal screw cap.<br> 
 With more careful heating, note the "rotten egg" smell of hydrogen sulfide.<br> 
 Allow the metal screw cap to cool.<br> 
 Moisten the white residue with a weak acid, e.g. vinegar.<br> 
 The smell of hydrogen sulfide gas becomes stronger.<br> 
 Dip a strip of clean newspaper in the copper (II) sulfate solution and hold it over the meal screw cap.<br>

 1. Party balloons can be inflated with gas only from a high pressure source, e.g. a gas cylinder.<br> 
 2. Snap lock resealable polythene bags.<br> 
 They can be resealed with a finger press sealing strip to give a gas tight seal.<br> 
 The closure system, which reseals an opened bag includes a pressure sensitive adhesive on the front side, and a defined release surface on the back of the bag.<br> 
 The top portion of the bag is folded so that the defined release surface comes into contact with the adhesive to reseal the opened bag.<br> 
3. The plastic bag used in a 2 litre wine cask can be washed out and used to store gas.<br> 
 Use a cork borer to insert a glass tube through a one hole rubber stopper.<br> 
 Be Careful! Leave 1 cm of glass tube to protrude from the top of the stopper.<br> 
 Pull tight around the neck of the plastic bag around the rubber stopper and secure it tightly with a cable tie.<br> 
 To check for leaks, close the end of the glass tube with a rubber cap, immerse the bag in water and squeeze the bag.<br> 
 To fill the bag, squeeze it flat then fill it from a gas cylinder or chemical generator.<br> 
 Refill the bag and squeeze out the gas more than once to ensure that any air is flushed out.<br> 
 When the bag is finally filled, close the glass tube with a rubber cap.<br> 
 To get a gas sample, inject the hypodermic needle of a syringe through the rubber cap and suck gas into the syringe.<br> 
 A cable tie usually consists of a Nylon tape with a gear rack and a ratchet within a small open case.<br> 
 When the pointed tip of the cable tie has been pulled through the case and past the ratchet, it cannot be pulled back, but the loop formed may be pulled tighter.<br> 
 Cable ties are used to bind several cables together, e.g. cables around a motor car engine.<br>

 Put 15 mL of 3% w/w (3 g H2O2 /100 g solution) hydrogen peroxide solution into flask A.<br>

 Weigh flask A and its contents, W1.<br> 
 Attach Plastic tube 1 and Plastic tube 2 to flask B only.<br> 
 Put water into flask B leaving a space in the neck of the flask.<br> 
 Add water to a beaker until it is one third full.<br> 
 Siphon water into the beaker by blowing into the open end of Rubber tube1 or by using a pipette bulb.<br> 
 Raise and lower the beaker to remove any air bubbles from Plastic tube 2.<br> 
 Adjust the height of the beaker so that the levels of the water in the beaker and in flask B are the same.<br> 
 Connect Plastic tube one to flask A.<br> 
 Raise the beaker to check for leaks in the apparatus.<br> 
 Again, adjust the height of the beaker so that the levels of the water in the beaker and in flask B are the same.<br>

 Again, adjust the height of the beaker so that the levels of the water in the beaker and in flask B are the same.<br> 
 Close the pinch clamp.<br> 
 Remove the stopper in flask A, insert a thermometer and note the temperature of the gas inside, T1.<br> 
 Repeat this measurement with flask B, T2.<br> 
 Disconnect Plastic tube 1 from flask A and again weigh flask A and its contents, W2.<br> 
 Measure the oxygen produced, by measuring the volume or weight water in the beaker, V.<br> 
 Find the vapour pressure of water at that temperature from the Table of saturated vapour pressure over water, Psvp.<br> 
 Note the room temperature.<br> 
 Note the barometric pressure from a barometer or ask the weather bureau or local airport.<br> 
 Calculation 1.<br>
Calculate the volume at STP of 32 g, one mole, of oxygen gas.<br> 
 (W2 - W)1 = Loss in weight<br>
 VO2 = volume of water in the beaker = volume of oxygen collected<br>
 Tf = average temperature in the flasks = (T1 + T2) / 2<br>
 Patm = atmospheric pressure = pressure of oxygen in the flask, PO2 + saturation vapour pressure of water at that temperature, Psvp.<br> 
 So PO2 = (Patm - Psvp)<br>
 VO2 = volume of oxygen in the flask<br>
 Tstp = temperature at STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure) = 0<sup>o</sup>C, 273 K<br>
 Pstp = pressure at STP = 760 mm Hg = 101325 Pa<br>
 Vstp = volume at STP.<br> 
 P1V1 / T1 = P2V2 / T2 (Boyle's law and Charles's law)<br>
 (P1 Ã— V1) / T1 = (P2 Ã— V2) / T2<br>
 (PO2 Ã— VO2) / Tf = (Pstp Ã— Vstp) / Tstp<br>
 So Vstp = VO2 [(PO2 / Pstp) Ã— (Tstp / Tf)]<br>
 Relative molecular mass of oxygen = 32 g<br>
 So number of moles of oxygen = (W2-W1) / 32<br>
 So the molar volume of oxygen at stp = Vstp / number of moles of oxygen = litres / mole<br>
 A mole of an ideal gas occupies 22.4 litres at STP.<br> 
 Calculation 2.<br>
If barometric pressure = 1016 kPa, average temperature = 20<sup>o</sup>C, loss in weight of flask = 0.2 g, volume of oxygen collected 
 at average temperature = 140 mL<br>
 Pressure of oxygen in apparatus = (barometric pressure - SVP at 20<sup>o</sup>C) = (1016 - 2.3) = 1013.7 kPa<br>
 Vstp = 140 [(1013.66 / 101.325) Ã— (293 / 273)] = 503.17 mL<br>
 Number of moles = 0.2 / 32 = 0.00625 moles<br>
 Molar volume = 140 / 0.00625 = 22400 = 22.4 litres = 22.4 L / mole<br>
