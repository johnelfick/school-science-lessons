 Coade stone, "lithodipyra", was a popular artificial stone used before the invention of Portland cement, used for statues and sculptures.<br>
 It was famed to resist weathering and many statues and facades remain unweathered today.<br>
 It was made from a secret recipe of silica, alumina, flint, quartz, clay and soda-lime glass.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="34.5H">34.5</a> Earthquakes, Richter scale<br>
 Earthquakes are violent moving or shaking of the Earth's caused by geological forces or volcanic activity.<br>
 Seismic waves are the vibrations from earthquakes that travel through the Earth.<br>
 They are recorded on seismographs that record a zig-zag trace of the amplitudes of ground oscillations.<br>
 Seismographs can detect earthquakes from sources anywhere in the world.<br>
 The Richter Magnitude Scale (Charles F. Richter, USA, 1935), an open-ended scale, is used to compare the size of earthquakes from the logarithm 
 of the amplitude of waves recorded by seismographs, adjusting for the distance between seismographs and the epicentre of the earthquakes.<br>
 Each point on the scale presents a ten-fold increase in magnitude.<br>
 Magnitude is expressed in whole numbers and decimal fractions, e.g. strong earthquake magnitude 6.3.<br>
The more recent Moment Magnitude Scale is a logarithmic scale of 1 to 10 that enables seismologists to compare the energy released by different earthquakes on the basis of the area of the geological fault that ruptured in the earthquake.<br>

Oxyacetylene welding, (oxy-acetylene welding)<br>
In excess air, acetylene (ethyne), burns with a hot white flame.<br>
If the acetylene is mixed with oxygen from separate gas cylinders in an oxy-acetylene torch, a temperature of 3 500<sup>o</sup>C can be produced to allow welding of tubes and pipes.<br>
The two ends of the metal objects to be welded are heated until they begin to melt.<br>
Rods of "filler" metal are melted along the joint then the joint cools and solidifies.<br>
The oxyacetylene flame can burn under water.<br>
Also, metal can be preheated with the oxyacetylene flame then cut with a pure oxygen flame.<br>

<a href="https://www.teaching.com.au/product/SER1066601/">Tectonic stress</a> Modern Teaching Aids</a><br>
Tectonic stress is the force per unit area on rocks.<br>
1. Confining stress occurs when rocks are pushed down by the rocks, so they cannot move and cannot deform.<br>.
2. Compression stress occurs when rocks are squeezed together, causing the rocks to fold or fracture, and is most common stress at convergent plate boundaries.<br>
3. Tension stress occurs when rocks are pulled apart, causing the rocks to lengthen or break apart, and is most common at divergent plate boundaries.<br>
4. Shear stress occurs when forces on the rocks are moving in parallel opposite directions, and is  most common stress at transform plate boundaries.<br>
Responses to increasing stress<br> 
5. Elastic deformation occurs when the rock returns to its original shape when the stress is removed.<br>
6. Plastic deformation occurs when rocks under stress do not return to its original shape when the stress is removed.<br>
7. Fracture occurs when a rock under stress breaks.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="34.17H">34.17</a> Prepare quicklime, CaO<br>
 The word "lime" is commonly used for both quicklime and slaked lime.<br>
 Quicklime is manufactured by roasting chalk or limestone in a lime kiln.<br>
 It emits a brilliant light when strongly heated, and was used for lighting stages, hence the phrase  "to be in the limelight".<br>
Quicklime, burnt lime, CaO, is prepared from marble, chalk, or limestone, CaCO3<br>
1.  Use a lump of marble, chalk (not blackboard chalk), or limestone twice the size of a thimble, and 20 cm of iron wire.<br>
 Copper wire is not suitable, because it melts with the heat.<br>
 The wire used for tying up bundles of firewood answers the purpose.<br>
 Tie one end of the wire round the lump and hold the other end in a pair of pliers or fasten it in a metal stand.<br>
 Put a sheet of asbestos or a metal tray below the Bunsen burner in case the lump falls out of the wire.<br>
 Suspend the lump just inside a very hot flame and heat it for ten to fifteen minutes.<br>
 In a short time the lump begins to glow as quicklime forms.<br>
 After heating let the lump to cool on the asbestos or metal tray.<br>
  2. Put the lump of marble, chalk or  limestone into a glowing fire with a pair of tongs  and leave it there for twenty minutes.<br>
  Quicklime can also be made from powdered chalk with the help of a home-made blowpipe.<br>
  CaCO3 --> CaO + CO2<br>
 Calcium carbonate --> calcium oxide + carbon dioxide.<br>
This lime-burning occurs above about 830oC.<br> 
After cooling, the quicklime is slowly converted back to calcium carbonate because of the revers reaction with the carbon dioxide in the air.

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="34.18H">34.18</a> Prepare slaked lime. Ca(OH)2<br>
 Slaked lime, or calcium hydroxide, is made from quicklime by adding water to the latter.<br>
 This process is called "slaking" the quicklime.<br>
 Slaked lime is used to make limewater and mortar.<br>
 It is also used by gardeners to "sweeten" the soil, i.e. increase the pH.<br>
 Slaked lime, E526, is a saturated solution of calcium hydroxide, and is also called limewater or milk of lime or killed lime.<br>.
  Put small lumps of fresh quicklime into an evaporating dish or watch glass.<br>
 Use a test-tube to add drops of water.<br>
 Clouds of steam arise, accompanied by a hissing noise.<br>
 The water may boil.<br>
 Finally, the solid breaks up into a fine, dry powder.<br>
 The water has combined chemically with the quicklime, and slaked lime remains.<br>
 The word "quick" in quicklime means "live", as in "the quick and the dead" and "quicksands".<br>
 The superstitious people of the middle ages believed that quicklime was inhabited by a "spirit".<br>
 When water was added to quicklime the "spirit" was released and a "dead" substance remained.<br>
  CaO + H2O --> Ca(OH)2<br>
 Calcium oxide + water --> calcium hydroxide<br>
The solution can cause burns.<br>
The white calcium hydroxide powder is not very soluble in water and as it dissolves it emits heat, leaving the rest in suspension.<br>
Its solubity decreases wiht temperature, called retrograde or reverse solubility.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="34.19H">34.19</a> Prepare putty<br>
 Prepare putty (glazier's putty, painter's putty), with calcium carbonate paste (whiting), + linseed oil (+ white lead).<br>
 Putty is used as a, filler in glazing, to seal glass into frames.<br>

<a href="3.2.66ch.GIF">See diagram 3.2.66</a>: Cardboard box for cement test.<br>
 Cement is any material that binds loose sediment into a rock and may be ferruginous (containing iron), calcareous (containing calcium),  and siliceous (containing silica).<br>
 Builders' cement contains calcium and aluminium silicates.<br>
 Concrete contains aggregate (gravel and sand), cement, and water.<br>
 Concrete can be cast into shape to become load bearing.<br>
 Mortar contains sand, cement and water and is used for plasters.<br>
 Grouts contain cement and water and are used to fill gaps.<br>
Experiment<br>
 Make 5 boxes out of stiff paper or cardboard 1.5 cm deep, 5 cm wide and 10 cm long.<br>
 Use adhesive tape or clips to fasten the edges.<br>
 A cement brick, the same size as the clay bricks, can be cast in these boxes.<br>
 Smear a little oil or grease around the inside surfaces of the boxes.<br>
 Obtain some fresh Portland cement from a builder.<br>
1. Cement / water brick<br>
 Mix the cement with water to a thick paste and fill the box with it, smoothing off the top surface level with the paper.<br>
 It should "set" in a few minutes, but it will take a few days to "harden".<br>
 "Setting" is to change from a fluid to a firm rigid material, but a mark can still be scratched on the surface with a nail.<br>
 To "harden" is to become rock hard.<br>
2. Cement / sand / water brick<br>
 Mix 1 part of cement powder with 3 parts of clean sand.<br>
 Work into a thick paste with water.<br>
 Pour into the paper box, smooth off the surface and leave to set and harden.<br>
3. Cement / sand / gravel / water brick<br>
 Make a brick as before using 1 part cement powder, 1 part of sand, 3 parts
clean gravel and water.<br>
 Cast the brick and leave to set and harden.<br>
 This is a concrete brick.<br>
4. Cement / lime / sand / water brick<br>
 A builder buys quicklime and mixes this with water to make calcium hydroxide 
on the building site just before he uses it.<br>
 Mix 1 part of cement, 5 parts of builders' lime, calcium hydroxide, and 
2 parts of sand and make into a paste with water.<br>
 Cast a brick as before and leave to harden.<br>
5. Test the strength of the above bricks.<br>

 Concrete is an artificial stone used as a building material.<br>
 It contains cement, sand, water and an aggregate, crushed stone or slag, a mixture of oxides formed during ore smelting and refining.<br>
 Reinforced concrete uses steel bars, twist bars, or cables to counteract  weakness in tension.<br>
 Alkaline cement protects steel reinforcing rods in concrete from corrosion.<br>
 Clean pieces of steel reinforcing or nails with sandpaper  and put them into two jars half filled with water.<br>
 Put broken pieces of concrete in one jar.<br>
 After a week, note that the steel in the jar without the concrete corrodes faster.<br>
Carbon dioxide from the atmosphere slowly penetrates the surface of concrete and reacts with lime, Ca(OH)2, to convert it to limestone, CaCO3,  reducing the alkalinity of the concrete touching the steel bars.<br>
The steel can form rust containing iron oxides and hydroxides that have a larger volume than iron.<br>
 This expansion cracks the concrete.<br>
 Find a broken piece of old exposed concrete.<br>
 Break it and wet the new surface with phenolphthalein indicator solution.<br>
 A pink coloration indicates the high alkalinity inside the concrete with a rim of untinted concrete around the edge.<br>

 Weigh the polystyrene cup and contents again to check the weight of the added amount of water.<br>
 Fill another polystyrene cup with water to the same level and weigh the cup + water.<br>
 Leave the polystyrene cups for one day then weigh them again.<br>
 The loss in weight of the cup + water only shows the loss by evaporation of the cup + cement mixture + water.<br>
 The rough surface area of the setting concrete does allow water to evaporate faster than in cup + water only.<br>
 However, the loss by evaporation is negligible.<br>
 The experiment shows that most of the added water is absorbed in the chemical  reaction of the setting cement.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="34.2.2H">34.2.2</a> Portland cement<br>
 1. Portland cement hardens as it reacts with water.<br>
 It was thought to have the same colour as stone on Isle of Portland, U.K.<br>
 Portland cement is a fine powder produced by grinding Portland cement clinker and some gypsum.<br>
2. The raw mixture is mainly chalk or limestone containing clay or silicon dioxide and other materials, including clay, shale, sand, iron ore, bauxite,.<br>
 fly ash and slag, i.e., minerals containing calcium oxide, silicon oxide, calcium aluminate, aluminium oxide, ferric oxide, and magnesium oxide.<br>
 Calcium and silicon form the calcium silicates that give strength to the concrete.<br>
 Aluminium and iron compounds produce the liquid solvent flux in the kiln that helps in the formation of silicates at a conveniently low  temperature.<br>
3. The raw mixture is heated in a cement kiln at 
 1400-1450 <sup>o</sup>C so that the ingredients become sintered, i.e. about one third melted, but not fused into a molten mass.<br>
 It cools to become grey-coloured clinker containing at least two thirds  by weight of calcium silicates.<br>
 Calcium sulfate as gypsum is added to the clinker.<br>
 The gypsum hydrates very rapidly during the concrete setting reaction and helps to control the initial setting rate.<br>
 The mixture is ground to form fine cement powder that can be stored dry and later mixed with water to form an alkaline cement  workable slurry for casting.<br>
4. Portland cement powder may contain 50% tricalcium silicate, 3(CaO).SiO2, 25% dicalcium silicate, 2(CaO).SiO2,.<br>
 10% tricalcium aluminate, 3(CaO).Al2O3, 10% tetracalcium aluminoferrite, 4(CaO)4.Al2O3.Fe2O3, 5% gypsum, CaSO4.2H2O.<br>
 So Portland cement contains approximately 65%, calcium oxide, CaO 25%, silicon oxide, SiO2, 5% aluminium oxide, Al2O3, 1% ferric oxide, Fe2O3 and 4% calcium sulfate, CaSO4.<br>
 Different types of cement contain the same four major compounds that make up at least 90% of the total weight, but in different  proportions.<br>
 Tricalcium silicate + water (yields) --> calcium silicate hydrate + calcium hydroxide + heat.<br>
5. When water is added to concrete powder, hydration occurs and during this chemical reaction the concrete gradually hardens as calcium silicate.<br>
 hydrate gel that forms in the first few days at the surface and later deeper in the pour.<br>
 The strength of hard concrete comes from the solid part of the paste, the calcium silicate hydrate and other crystalline phases.<br>
 The pores remaining in hard concrete are filled with water and air and have no strength.<br>
 dicalcium silicate + dicalcium silicate + water --> calcium silicate  hydrate + calcium hydroxide + heat<br>
 The volume of setting concrete should not change, because the added water should be used up in the hydration process.<br>
 So the weight of cement powder + water + aggregate = weight of the set concrete block (conservation of mass).<br>
 The water-cement ratio (by weight) of completely hydrated cement is 0.22 to 0.25, excluding evaporable water.<br>
 So the warning "Do not touch wet concrete until it dries" is inaccurate  because nearly all the water is lost of the hydration reaction, not  by evaporation.<br>
 The rate of reaction of the cement with water is proportional to the surface area of the particles.<br>
 Cement production requires high energy input and produces large quantities  of carbon dioxide, so it contributes to global warming.<br>
 However, EMC, Energetically Modified Cement, uses very finely ground ingredients that have increased surface area for the chemical  reaction and uses less energy to produce it.<br>

 Heating steel material to "red heat" then cooling it slowly is called annealing.<br>
 Putting steel material heated to red heat into cold liquid to cool it quickly is called quenching.<br>
 Reheated steel material is quenched to the temperature slightly lower than "red heat" temperature, then cooled slowly, called tempering.<br>
 Annealing, quenching and tempering are heat treatings to change rigidity,  brittleness and toughness, by changing the arrangement of iron  atoms.<br>
 Annealing is a form of heat treatment to soften a metal and make it easier to work.<br>
 Annealing is often used to soften steel to relax its inner stress to change its shape by forging, pressing and machining.<br>

 These needles are alloys of iron and carbon, but the proportion of carbon is very small.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="34.9.3H">34.9.3</a> Heat treatment of
razor blades or steel knitting needles<br>
 The properties of steel whether it is hard, tough, springy depend on the 
manner in which the steel has been treated previously and, in 
 particular, on how it has been heated or cooled.<br>
Experiment<br>
 1. Hold one end of a razor blade in a pair of pliers and try to bend the
other with a pair of pincers.<br>
 The blade snaps, because it is brittle, although the steel is extremely
 hard.<br>
2. Hold one corner of a razor blade in a pair of 
 pliers and heat it strongly over a Bunsen burner flame until it is red 
hot.<br>
 When it has been red hot for half a minute make the flame gradually less 
hot and smaller, so that the blade cools down very slowly.<br>
 The gradual cooling should occupy at least five minutes.<br>
 When the blade is cold it is found to have lost its hard and brittle character.<br>
 It can now be bent easily without breaking, and it stays bent.<br>
 This process of slow cooling is called "annealing" the steel.<br>
3. Straighten the blade used in the foregoing experiment, 
 and once more heat it until it is red hot.<br>
 Have available cold water in an old cup or mug.<br>
 When the blade has been red hot for a short time put it into the cold water.<br>
 The rapid cooling in this treatment makes the blade hard and brittle.<br>
4. Dry the blade after the quick cooling in the 
 previous experiment.<br>
 Rub it with emery paper until the surface is bright and clean.<br>
 Holding the corner of the blade in the pliers.<br>
 Heat it by holding it an inch above a medium Bunsen burner flame until 
a blue sheen just appears over the surface.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="34.11.1H">34.11.1</a> Mechanical properties of materials, elastic, ductile, malleable<br>
<a href="34.5.0.GIF">See diagram 34.5.0</a>: Three tubes, originally of the same length.<br>
 In the diagram, the three bars were originally all the same length.<br>
 They demonstrate the concepts of stress, strain, Poisson's ratio and the strength of a material.<br>
 Stress: force per unit area<br>
 Strain: deformation produced by stress<br>
 Poisson's ratio: the ratio of the proportional decrease in a lateral measurement to the proportional increase in length of a stretched  substance.<br>
1. Elastic<br>
 If forces are applied to a body remaining in equilibrium, the length volume or shape alters temporarily or permanently, i.e. it becomes deformed.<br>
 If the forces applied to the body stop and the body regains its original length, volume and shape, then the deformation occurred within  the elastic limit of the body.<br>
 The magnitude of the elasticity of the body or the material comprising the body is expressed as a modulus of elasticity.<br>
2. Ductile<br>
 Ductility is the ability of metals or alloys to keep their strength and be permanently distorted and not crack or fracture, when their  shape is altered.<br>
 Some ductile metals, e.g. copper, can be drawn through a die to reduce the cross-section by plastic flow and form wire, but other  metals lose their strength and crack.<br>
 Gold is among the most ductile metals.<br>
 One gram of gold can be drawn into a wire 2 km long.<br>
 The atoms of a ductile metal can slide past each other without causing the material to break into pieces.<br>
 Also, a ductile metal can be hammered so finely that light can pass through it.<br>
 Only metals are ductile.<br>
3. Malleable<br>
 A malleable metal can be hammered, pressed or extruded out of the original shape, and not tend to return to the original shape or to  fracture or break.<br>
 Both ductile and malleable metals or alloys have large crystals.<br>
 Metals have a regular pattern of fixed particles consisting of the nucleus of an atom and inner electrons around the atom.<br>
Outer electrons (delocalized electrons, valence electrons) are held only loosely by the nuclei of the atoms, so they can mover freely between the fixed particles allowing metals to have good heat conductivity and good electrical conductivity.<br>
 Metals are malleable and ductile, because distorting metallic crystals does not completely break all the metallic bonds.<br>
 Many metals have high melting points and high boiling points, because their chemical bonds are strong.<br>
 The greater the number of outer shell valence electrons the higher the boilingpoint.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a href="UNPh35.html#35.20">See 35.20</a>: Tenacity (Geology)<br>
Elastic materials strain when stretched and quickly return to their original state once the stress is removed, usually caused by bond stretching along crystallographic planes in an ordered solid.<br>
The three types of stress<br>
1. Tension: Equal and opposite forces acting away from each other along the same line of action that tend to elongate the body.<br>
2. Compression: Equal and opposite forces acting away towards each other along the same line of action that tend to shorten the body.<br>
3. Shear: Equal and opposite forces acting along different lines of action that tend to twist the body without changing its volume.<br>
 The amount of deformation is proportional to the applied stress only until the applied stress reaches the elastic limit.<br>
 Within the elastic limit when the deforming force is removed the body returns
to its original shape and volume.<br>
 At some stage applied stress beyond the elastic limit the body can no longer
be deformed and so it breaks.<br>
 For example, stretch springs of copper and brass.<br>
 The copper spring remains extended, because it has reached its elastic limit.<br>
 Shearing causes shear strain, where parallel surfaces slide past one another, 
occurs when forces are applied to shears and scissors.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="34.11.5H">34.11.5</a> Viscoelasticity, creep<br>
 Viscoelastic materials show viscous and elastic characteristics when deformed.<br>
 They have the relationship between stress and strain depending on time.<br>
 All materials have some viscoelastic response.<br>
 For example, the behaviour of steel or aluminium, at room temperature and
under small strain, does not deviate much from linear 
 elasticity.<br>
 Viscoelastic effects occur in synthetic polymer foams, polystyrene, guitar 
strings, tuning forks, wood, metals at high temperature, 
 shoe insoles, human tissue, e.g. spinal discs, skin.<br>
 For example, if skin is pinched, the harder the pinch the longer it takes 
to return to its normal position.<br>
 Creep is a slow, progressive deformation of a material under constant stress.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">The behaviour of viscoelastic materials include 
 the following:<br>
 1. If the stress is held constant, the strain increases with time, viscoelastic 
creep.<br>
 2. If the strain is held constant, the stress decreases with time, viscoelastic 
relaxation.<br>
 3. The effective stiffness depends on the rate of application of the load.<br>
 4. If cyclic loading is applied, hysteresis, a phase lag, occurs, leading 
to a dissipation of mechanical energy.<br>
 5. Acoustic waves experience attenuation.<br>
 6. Rebound of an object following an impact is less than 100%.<br>
 7. During rolling, frictional resistance occurs.<br>

 Hooke's law states that, within the elastic limit, the stress is proportional 
 to the strain.<br>
 The constant of proportionality, elastic constant, for a material is called 
Young's modulus, E.<br>
 With wires made of iron or annealed steels, at the elastic limit (yield 
point), a sudden plastic deformation occurs.<br>
 The wire "gives" and despite decrease of stress the wire does not return 
to its previous shorter length.<br>
 Hooke's law does not apply to polymers or rubber.<br>
 When a small stress results in a big strain, the material is soft.<br>
 When a big stress results in a small strain, the material is hard.<br>
 When a small stress results in permanent deformation, the material is plastic.<br>
 A modulus is a numerical quantity representing some quality of a substance 
 equal to the ratio of the magnitude of the cause to the 
 magnitude of its effect on the substance.<br>
 The bulk modulus of a material is often expressed for convenience in GPa, 
gigapascals.<br>
 1 gigapascal = 1000000000 pascal, 10<sup>9</sup> pa.<br>
Experiment<br>
 1. Mark the beginning and end positions of several different masses.<br>
 Compare the end positions of masses that are multiples, such as double 
or triple.<br>
2. With the spring held in the pin vice on the stand, 
weights are added in steps of 1 kg.<br>
 The greater the weight added, the greater the extension of the spring and
the relation between them should be linear in nature 
 according to Hooke's Law.<br>
 Releasing the weights should see a return to the original extension.<br>
 When this is occurring the spring is displaying elastic deformation.<br>
 If enough weight is added to the spring, it will deform permanently and 
lose its elasticity.<br>
 This is known as plastic deformation.<br>
 It is interesting to note that if the experiment is repeated with rubber 
bands, Hooke's Law is not followed.<br>
 Rubber is extremely non-linear in its stress-strain characteristics.<br>
3. Pull on a horizontal spring with a spring scale.<br>
 Use 2 metres of copper wire, e.g. 32 SWG, stretched by weights attached 
 to the end the wire through a pulley.<br>
 Plot a graph of load against extension of the wire.<br>
 The graph is a straight line to show that Hooke's law applies, extension 
 is proportional to stretching force.<br>
 Take off weights and observe that the wire returns to its previous lengths 
at the same tensions.<br>
4. Repeat the experiment by adding weights until 
 the wire suddenly "gives" or "runs".<br>
 This is called the yield point.<br>
 The wire has stretch proportionally much more than previously for the load
added.<br>
 The wire can support heavier loads.<br>
 However, when the weights are removed, the wire can no longer return to
its original lengths.<br>
 At the yield point the wire had reached its elastic limit and Hooke's law
no longer applies.<br>
 In engineering, metal components should carry loads only within their elastic
limits.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2">However, the malleability, ductility, and power 
 of resisting oxygen of alloys is generally diminished.<br>
 The alloy formed of two brittle metals is always brittle.<br>
 The alloys formed of metals having different fusing points are usually 
malleable while cold and brittle while hot.<br>
 The action of the air on alloys is generally less than on their simple 
metals, unless the former are heated.<br>
 A mixture of 1 part of tin and 3 parts of lead is scarcely acted on at common
temperatures, but at a red heat it readily takes fire, and 
 continues to burn for some time.<br>
 Similarly, a mixture of tin and zinc, when strongly heated, rapidly decomposes 
both moist air and steam.<br>
 Brittleness is the tendency for metals or alloys to have a brittle fracture 
when under tension, without plastic deformation, i.e. still 
 keeping its shape.<br>
 Brittleness mean a low value of fracture toughness, toughness.<br>
 Brittle fracture is causes by cracks leading to more cracks usually along 
certain crystal planes.<br>

Shear is a kind of deformation of materials where parallel plates of the material are displaced in a direction parallel to themselves, but the parallel 
 plates remain parallel.<br>
 So the adjacent planes of parallel plates slide over each other.<br>
 If a shearing force is applied parallel to one side of a rectangle it becomes a parallelogram.<br>

<a href="34.7.2.GIF">See diagram 34.7.2</a>: "Happy ball bounces, sad ball does not bounce."<br>
 If a ball mass m is dropped from height h1 and rebounds to height h2, the loss of energy = mg(h1-h2).<br>
 The energy loss is expressed as the coefficient of restitution, e = v2/v1 = sqrt h2/h1, where v1 is the incident speed and v2 is the  rebound speed<br>
 1. Drop bounce and no-bounce balls.<br>
 Measure the height the bouncing ball is dropped from, and the height it bounces to, and calculate the coefficient of restitution.<br>
 The sad ball will not bounce as it is made from energy absorbing material.<br>
2. Newton found experimentally that if two smooth  spheres collide with velocities u1 and u2 and rebound with velocities v1and v2,<br>
 then - (v2 - v1) / (u2 - u1) is a positive constant, e, independent of the initial velocities, called the coefficient of elasticity or coefficient  off restitution.<br>
 The value of the constant e depends on the substances, e.g. 0.9 for glass and 0.2 for lead.<br>
3. The coefficient of restitution can be used to  measure of the elasticity of the collision between ball and racquet.<br>
 Elasticity is a measure of bounce, i.e. how much of the kinetic energy of the colliding objects remains after the collision.<br>
 With an inelastic collision, some kinetic energy is transformed into deformation of the material, heat, sound, and not available for  movement.<br>
 For a perfectly elastic collision, coefficient of restitution = 1, e.g. two diamonds colliding.<br>
 For a perfectly plastic, i.e. inelastic, collision, coefficient of restitution = 1, e.g. two lumps of Plasticine (modelling clay) that do not  bounce, but stick together.<br>
 The coefficient of restitution = difference in velocities of two colliding  objects after the collision / difference in velocities of two colliding  objects after the collision.<br>
 For a racquet and ball, v1 = velocity racquet centre before impact, s1 =velocity ball before impact, v2 = velocity racquet centre  after impact, s2 = velocity ball after impact.<br>
 Coefficient of Restitution = (s2 - v2) / (v1 - s1)<br>
 For a falling object bouncing off the floor, coefficient of restitution = (bounce height / drop height), e.g. for a particular bouncing ball,  coefficient of restitution = 0.85.<br>

<a href="34.4.3.GIF">See diagram: 34.4.3</a>: Precipitators.<br>
 To build a model to show the action of an electrostatic precipitator you need concentrated hydrochloric acid, concentrated ammonia solution, gas  jar or measuring cylinder, test-tubes, thin metal rod, glass and plastic tubing, stoppers, induction coil and leads, aquarium pump and aluminium 
 foil.
 The aluminium foil making up the outer electrode should be in the form of a cylinder inside the walls of the jar, but if you want to see what is happening  inside, you may leave a space.<br>
 Turn on the pump.<br>
 Hydrogen chloride from the acid reacts with ammonia from the next test-tube to form a smoke of ammonium chloride.<br>
 Notice the amount of smoke emerging from the chimney.<br>
 Gradually increase the flow of air from the pump then turn on the induction coil to supply the high voltage.<br>
Note any change in the smoke from the chimney.<br>

 Minerals differ greatly in hardness.<br>
 The hardness refers to the resistance of a mineral to scratching, scratch hardness.<br>
 The Mohs scale of hardness (Friedrich Mohs, Germany, 1773 - 1839) has a range from 1 (softest) to 10 (hardest).<br>
 Hold a specimen of a mineral with forceps and try to scratch the following substances with it:<br>
 fingernail hardness 2.5<br>
 piece of copper or copper coin hardness 3<br>
 steel knife blade hardness 3.5<br>
window glass hardness 3.5 to 6.0<br>
steel file hardness 6<br>
diamond hardness 10<br>
 American coins have hardness 2.5, but the old "Indian heads" penny has hardness 3.5.<br>
 Hardness 7 substances produce sparks when hit with steel.<br>
Be careful! When hardness testing with glass, do not hold the glass in the hand, but place it on a flat surface.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Mohs scale of hardness of minerals: 1. talc 2. gypsum 3. calcite 4. fluorite 5. apatite 6. orthoclase feldspar 7. quartz 8. topaz 9. corunum 10. diamond<br>
 The Mohs scale of hardness of gemstones: topaz 7 emerald 8 sapphire 9 ruby 9 diamond 10.<br>
An unglazed porcelain streak plate used by geologists has approximately 7.0 hardness<br>
This hardness test can be applied only to fresh unweathered specimens.<br>
The columnar mineral kyanite is unusual, because has hardness 4-4.5 vertically, but hardness 6-7 horizontally.<br>
Fibrous and porous aggregates may have a deceptively lower hardness, because of the spaces between grains.<br>
Determining the hardness of earthy minerals, fine grain minerals and needle-shaped fibrous minerals is almost impossible.<br>
Engineers do not use Mohs scale, but define harness as resistance to indentation by a tool tipped with a pyramid-shaped diamond.<br>
The scales include "Vickers", "Rockwell" and "Knoop", in units of force (newton) / diameter<sup>2</sup> of the indentation, at an angle of 136<sup>o</sup>.<br>
For example, the Australian "kangaroo" $1 Aluminium Bronze coin blanks have Vickers hardness 80.<br>

Many different versions exist of tables to show the most abundant elements in the Earth's crust, for example:<br>
Let "most abundant" refer to % of total mass and not the number individual atoms.<br>
On the earth's crust the most abundant element is oxygen, (about 46 %), because oxygen is a very common rock-forming element, together with silicon (28 %).<br>
Other common elements are aluminium (8.2%), iron (5.6%), calcium (4.2%), sodium (2.5%), magnesium (2.4%), potassium, (2.0%).<br>
So aluminium is the most common metal in the earth's crust, which makes up only a tiny portion of the entire earth.<br>
Beneath the earth's crust, the mantle contains 44.8% oxygen, 23% magnesium and 22% silicon, and the mantle makes up about 84% of the earth's volume.<br>
However, the closer to the earth's core the more dense the Earth.<br>
In the core, gravity is so strong the electromagnetic force between atoms is overcome, allowing for fusion fission to occur and the most "stable" form for nuclei 
is in the form of iron.<br>
The binding energy per nucleon in the nucleus is the highest in iron-56.<br>
Any element to the left of iron will go through fusion to create iron and every element to the right will go through fission and eventually become iron.<br
The core contains mainly iron at 88.8%.<br>
So the most abundant element in the Earth is iron at 32.1%, then oxygen at 30.1%, then silicon at 15.1%, and magnesium at 13.9%.<br>
