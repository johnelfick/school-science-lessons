<a href="./images/3.2.94ch.gif">See diagram 3.2.94: </a> Catalysts and rate of reaction.<br>
 1. Put a cube of sugar in a glass or aerated water, e.g. fizzy lemonade.<br>
 The drink fizzes more, because the sugar cube provides more sites for the formation of carbon dioxide bubbles on the sharp corners of the sugar crystals.<br>
 The sugar is said to act as a physical catalyst.<br>
 2. Fill a burette with water and invert it in a container of water to measure the volume of a gas in the burette by downward displacement of water.<br>
 Use a flask or test-tube fitted with a one-hole stopper and bent delivery tube.<br>
 Add 2 mL of 20 volumes of hydrogen peroxide to 50 L of water in the flask.<br>
 Note the time then immediately add 1 g of manganese (IV) oxide to the flask, close the stopper and adjust the end of the delivery tube inside the burette.<br>
 Note the volume of oxygen gas in the burette at intervals of 15 seconds.<br>
 Use graph paper to plot the volume of oxygen gas produced every 15 seconds against the time of the reaction.<br>
 Manganese (IV) oxide is the best catalyst for this reaction.<br>
 MnO2 + 2H2O2 --> MnO2 + 2H2O + O2<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="17.1.3H">17.1.3</a> Concentration of reactants, hydrochloric acid with magnesium<br>
 Pour 50 mL 6 M hydrochloric acid solution into a 100 mL standard flask.<br>
 Make up the solution to the mark and mix it well.<br>
 This is Solution B, 3 M.<br>
 Pipette 50 mL Solution B into another 100 mL standard flask.<br>
 Make up this solution to the mark and mix it well.<br>
 This is Solution C, 1.5 M.<br>
 Pour the remaining solution into a 100 mL beaker.<br>
 Pipette 50 mL solution C into another 100 mL standard flask and make this solution up to the mark and mix it well.<br>
 Label this solution D, 0.75 M.<br>
 Pour the remaining solution into a 100 mL beaker.<br>
 Pipette 50 mL of solution D into a 100 mL beaker.<br>
 Clean the oxide coating from a 2 cm strip of magnesium ribbon.<br>
 Cut off four 0.5 cm pieces of magnesium ribbon.<br>
 Put one strip into solution A and record the time of the reaction until you have dissolved all of the magnesium.<br>
 Repeat with a new magnesium strip for each of solutions B, C, and D.<br>
 Graph the results with time as the vertical axis and concentration as the horizontal axis.<br>
 Note whether a linear relationship exists between acid concentration and the rate at which magnesium dissolves.<br>
 Mg + 2HCl --> MgCl2 + H2.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="17.1.4H">17.1.4</a> Concentration and rate of reaction, sodium thiosulfate with dilute hydrochloric acid<br>
<a href="./images/3.2.92ch.gif">See diagram 3.2.92</a>: Black cross no longer visible.<br>
 1. Dissolve 5 g sodium thiosulfate crystals in 500 mL water.<br>
 Add 5 mL hydrochloric acid to 50 mL the sodium thiosulfate solution.<br>
2. Dissolve 20 g of sodium thiosulfate in 500 mL of water and put 50 mL of the solution in a container.<br>
 Place the container on a black cross marked on a sheet of paper.<br>
 Add 5 mL of dilute hydrochloric acid to the container and note the time.<br>
 Look down through the solution and note when the black cross is no longer visible.<br>
 Sulfur is produced during the reaction making the solution cloudy.<br>
 Repeat the experiment with 40 mL of sodium thiosulfate solution and 10 mL of water.<br>
 Add 5 mL of dilute hydrochloric acid.<br>
 The time when the black cross is no longer visible is greater.<br>
 Repeat the experiment with 30 mL of sodium thiosulfate solution and 20 mL of water.<br>
 The time when the black cross is no longer visible is still greater.<br>
 Repeat the experiment with 20 mL of sodium thiosulfate solution and 30 mL of water.<br>
 Use graph paper to plot the volume of the thiosulfate solution (concentration) against time taken for the reaction.<br>

<a href="./images/17.1.1ch.gif">See diagram 17.1.1</a>: Count bubbles, dilute hydrochloric acid with zinc<br>
1. Put a piece of granulated zinc in dilute hydrochloric acid in a test-tube.<br>
 Count the number of bubbles of hydrogen gas that reach the surface of the solution every 30 seconds.<br>
 Draw a graph by plotting the number of bubbles along the vertical axis and time along the horizontal axis.<br>
 The reaction starts quickly then becomes slower until it stops.<br>
The comparative rates of reaction is measured by the size of the extended balloons. 
2. <a href="./images/17.1.2ch.gif">See diagram 17.1.2</a>: Volume of gas, dilute hydrochloric acid with zinc<br>
 Repeat the experiment with a flask connected to a gas syringe to measure how much hydrogen gas forms in the reaction.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="17.1.7H">17.1.7</a> Dilute hydrochloric acid with marble chips<br>
<a href="./images/17.3.3ch.gif">See diagram 17.3.3</a>: Gas burette<br>
Saturation vapour pressure over water: <a href="UNPh12.html#12.5.3H">12.5.3</a>, (Table 2)<br>
This experiment is used to investigate: 1. the effect of changing the surface area of marble chips and 2. changing the concentration of hydrochloric acid. on the rate of reaction between marble chips and dilute hydrochloric acid.<br>
1. The smallest particles show the most vigorous reaction, because if you grind two pieces of substance with the same weight into coarse and fine sizes, the fine size pieces would have total surface area greater than the coarse pieces.<br>
 Be Careful! Hydrogen gas forms.<br>
 Break marble chips or granulated zinc into four sizes with a hammer.<br>
 Put 2 g of each into four test-tubes:<br>
 Test-tube 1, Original size as control,<br>
 Test-tube 2, Rice grain size,<br>
 Test-tube 3, Half rice grain size,<br>
 Test-tube 4, Coarse powder.<br>
 Add the same volume of 2 M hydrochloric acid to each test-tube.<br>
 Compare the reactions.<br>
 Rate of reaction of Test-tube 4 &gt; Test-tube 3 &gt; Test-tube 2 &gt; Test-tube 1.<br>
 Collect the gas in a burette inverted over water.<br>
 Compare how much gas forms in unit time for each size of marble chips or zinc.<br>
 Weigh the container and note the loss in mass every half minute while the reaction goes on.<br>
CaCO3 (s) + 2HCl (aq) --> CaCl2 (aq) + CO2 (g) + H2O (l)<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="17.1.8H">17.1.8</a> Measure rates of reaction<br>
Rates of reactions for laboratory experiments should not be so fast that an explosion occurs.<br>
Also, they should not be so slow that you cannot observe or measure any change in reasonable time.<br>
To measure the speed of a reaction you must measure some change, e.g. time taken for colour change, pH change, precipitate appears, reagents disappear, temperature change, volume of gas that forms<br>
weight of reactants used.<br>
Chemical reactions occur only if the particles of reactants can collide with sufficient energy, the activation energy, Ea.<br>
Reactions will become faster if the number of collisions increases and if the energy of collision increases.<br>
You can increase the rate of reaction by increasing concentration of reactants, light energy, particle size, pressure, temperature, and with catalysts.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="17.1.9.0H">17.1.9.0</a> Magnesium with hydrochloric acid<br>
 A reversible reaction can proceed in either direction by altering the conditions of the reaction, e.g. 1. altering the relative concentrations,<br>
 active mass 2. altering the temperature 3. altering the pressure.<br>
 Measure 10 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid into 4 beakers, then add the following:<br>
 Beaker A add nothing, Beaker B add 10 mL water, Beaker C add 30 mL water, Beaker D add 70 mL water.<br>
 Simultaneously add 6 cm of magnesium ribbon to each beaker.<br>
 Note how the rate of reaction in each beaker is proportional to the concentrations of the acid.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="17.1.9.1H">17.1.9.1</a> Potassium iodide with potassium iodate<br>
1. Put 30 mL of solution A containing 5 g of potassium iodate per litre in a measuring cylinder and dilute to 200 mL with water, then transfer to a beaker and add drops of starch solution.<br>
2. Put 30 mL of solution B containing 10 g of hydrated sodium sulfite per litre and 2.5 mL of 2M sulfuric acid in a measuring cylinder and dilute to 200 mL with water.<br>
3. Pour solution B into the beaker containing the diluted solution A.<br>
Note the starting time and record the time in seconds when a dark blue coloration appears.<br>
4. Repeat the experiment with 5 mL, 7.5 mL, 10 mL, 12.5 mL and 15 mL of 2M sulfuric acid.<br>
 Plot a graph of volume of acid to reciprocal of time and note the straight line result.<br>
 Reaction 1. is a slow and reaction.<br>
 The presence of iodine as a dark blue coloration indicates the completion of reaction 1.<br>
 Reaction 1. IO3<sup>-</sup> + 3HSO3<sup>-</sup> --> I<sup>-</sup> + 3HSO4<sup>-</sup><br>
 Reaction 2. is rapid, but does not occur until reaction 1. is complete<br>
 Reaction 2. 5I<sup>-</sup> + IO3<sup>-</sup> + 6H<sup>+</sup> --> 3I2 (s) + 3H2O.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="17.1.9.2H">17.1.9.2</a> Rate of reaction, k<br>
For many chemical reactions, but not all, increasing the concentrationof reactants increases the rate of reaction.<br>
The rate constant, k, is the constant for a given reaction at a given temperature.<br>
H2 (g) + I2 (g) --&gt; 2HI (g)<br>
rate = k [H2 (g)] [I2 (g)], where [H2(g)] = concentration of hydrogen gas<br>
If x = any substance, [x] = concentration of x.<br>
If in a chemical reaction, [x] is doubled and the rate of reaction remains constant, then the rate of reaction is independent of [x].<br>
If in a chemical reaction, [x] is doubled and the rate of reaction doubles, then the rate of reaction = k[x].<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="17.1.9.3H">17.1.9.3</a> Rates of reaction of aspirin<br>
Be Careful! Aspirin is a drug so do not let the students take them!<br>
 Soluble aspirins dissolve in water with a well defined end point and constants interaction time.<br>
 Use these tablets to investigate the effects of temperature, stirring, crushing and varying the water volume on reaction time.<br>
 Investigate the temperature change required to halve the reaction time between one tablet and known quantity of water at room temperature.<br>
 Investigate the number of tablets or fractions of tablets required to exactly double the reaction time in a known quantity of water at room temperature.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="17.1.9.4H">17.1.9.4</a> Size of particles and rate of reaction with balloons<br>
<a href="./images/3.2.91ch.gif">See diagram 3.2.91: </a> Size of particles and rate of reaction.<br>
 1. Use a hammer to break natural marble chips into four sizes:<br>
 1.1 coarse powder, 1.2 half a rice grain, 1.3 rice grain, 1.4. marble chips.<br>
 Put 2 g of each size separately into four test-tubes.<br>
 Blow up four balloons several times to stretch them.<br>
 Put 5 mL of dilute hydrochloric acid into each of the four balloons.<br>
 Slip the mouths of the balloons over the tops of the test-tubes, but do not let any acid enter the test-tubes.<br>
 Tip the acid from each balloon into the attached test-tube.<br>
 Note which balloon is the fastest and the slowest to expand, because of the production of carbon dioxide.<br>
 The coarse powder produces carbon dioxide in the shortest time.<br>
 2. Repeat the experiment without balloons, but with four conical flasks on a sensitive top balance.<br>
 Add 5 mL of dilute hydrochloric acid to 2 g of coarse powder and note the loss in weight every 30 seconds.<br>
 Then continue the experiment with the other sizes of marble chips.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="17.1.9.5H">17.1.9.5</a> Temperature and rate of reaction<br>
 Increase in temperature of 10<sup>o</sup>C usually doubles the rate of reaction.<br>
 The rate increases, because collisions between particles are more frequent and with more energy.<br>
 Also, more collisions per second may occur.<br>
 1. Add enough potassium manganate (VII) solution to dilute sulfuric acid to make it pink.<br>
 Put in a nail and record the time for the solution to lose the pink colour at room temperature.<br>
 Repeat the experiment at 10<sup>o</sup>C above room temperature.<br>
 Repeat the experiment at 20<sup>o</sup>C above room temperature.<br>
 Draw a graph to show time taken to decolorize against temperature.<br>
 The rate of reaction may double for each 10<sup>o</sup>C rise in temperature.<br>
2. Iron with sulfuric acid.<br>
 Put 1 g of steel wool in a test-tube and add 10 mL of dilute sulfuric acid.<br>
 Heat the mixture in a beaker of hot water until all the steel wool has dissolved.<br>
 Put a lighted paper into the test-tube to show that the gas given off is hydrogen gas.<br>
 Filter the solution while hot and leave to cool.<br>
 If crystals do not form on cooling, add alcohol to cause crystallization.<br>
 Pour off the liquid and dry the crystals between absorbent paper.<br>
 Observe the shape of the crystals of green salt iron sulfate.<br>
 iron(s) + sulfuric acid (aq) --> hydrogen (g) + iron sulfate (aq).<br>
3. Put 1 cm depth of iron filings in a test-tube.<br>
 Just cover the iron filings with a dilute acid solution.<br>
 Warm the test-tube until frothing starts.<br>
 Hydrogen gas is colourless and odourless, but any impurities in the iron filings give a nasty smell.<br>
 To tests for hydrogen gas, remove from heating, place your thumb over the end of the test-tube, count to five, apply a lighted paper to the end of the test-tube, the hydrogen gas explodes with a loud pop sound.<br>
 Never test more than one test-tube full of hydrogen gas!<br>
4. Dissolve 20 g of sodium thiosulfate in 500 mL of water and put 10 mL of the solution in a container.<br>
 Add 40 mL of water to the container.<br>
 Note the room temperature and add 5 mL of dilute hydrochloric acid.<br>
 Look down through the solution and note when the black cross is no longer visible.<br>
 Repeat the experiment at 30<sup>o</sup>C, 40<sup>o</sup>C, 50<sup>o</sup>C and 60<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 Use graph paper to plot the temperature of the sodium thiosulfate solution against time taken for the reaction.<br>
 The time when the black cross is no longer visible becomes less as the temperaturerises.<br>

 Heat drops of hydrogen peroxide in a test-tube.<br>
 When effervescence begins, put a glowing wood spill into the test-tube.<br>
 The spill relights, showing that oxygen is being produced.<br>
 Observe the rate at which hydrogen peroxide decomposes by the addition of acid or alkali.<br>
 Put 2 cm of hydrogen peroxide into each of two test-tubes.<br>
 To test-tube 1, add drops of a solution of sodium hydroxide or strong ammonia solution.<br>
 To test-tube 2, add sulfuric acid or citric acid.<br>
 Put both test-tubes into a beaker of hot water for one minute.<br>
 Test both test-tubes for oxygen.<br>
 Oxygen forms from test-tube 1 containing the alkali, but very little from the other test-tube.<br>
 Alkalis speed up the formation of oxygen, while acids slow it down.<br>
 For this reason acid is often added to containers of hydrogen peroxide to help it to keep its oxygen.<br>
 A catalyst is a substance that helps a chemical action without being changed itself.<br>
A substance that hinders instead of helping a chemical action is called a "negative" catalyst.<br>
So we say that sulfuric acid is a negative catalyst for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide.<br>

 Apply the glowing splinter test to any gas given off.<br>
 Hydrogen peroxide decomposes to give off oxygen when heated, but will decompose without heating when iron chloride and manganese dioxide are added to it.<br>
 The black colour of manganese dioxide and the brown colour of iron chloride remains after the reactions, so these chemicals may not have been altered during the reactions.<br>

Chemical equilibrium / dynamic equilibrium is a state in which the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the backward reaction.<br>
In other words, there is no net change in the concentration of reactants and products.<br>
 1. Equilibrium exists only in a closed system.<br>
 No reactants are put in and no reactants are taken out.<br>
 A closed system cannot exchange matter with its surroundings, but it may exchange energy with its surroundings.<br>
2. Limestone (calcium carbonate) is heated in a furnace to form quicklime (calcium oxide) and carbon dioxide.<br>
 The reverse reaction cannot occur, because the carbon dioxide is sucked out of the furnace.<br>
 Also, the calcium oxide is steadily and replaced by limestone.<br>
 This is a steady state system.<br>
 If the furnace were closed, at high temperature both decomposition and formation of calcium carbonate would occur.<br>
 When these process occur at the same rate then equilibrium exists.<br>
 CaCO3 (s) --> CaO (s) + CO2 (g).<br>
3. If different concentrations of iron (II) nitrate solution are added to potassium thiocyanate solution, at equilibrium the concentration of the FeSCN<sup>2+</sup>solution has a certain blue colour.<br>
 It is a property of this equilibrium reaction that does not change.<br>

 Fe<sup>3+</sup> (aq) + SCN<sup> -</sup> (aq) &lt;--> FeSCN<sup>2+</sup>(aq).<br>
4. The following equation shows that both forward and reverse reactions are going on.<br>
 It does not show the position of equilibrium.<br>
 The position at equilibrium shows whether there are more reactants or more products at equilibrium.<br>
 It can shift if reactants or products are added or removed.<br>
 N2O4 (g) &lt;--> 2NO2 (g)<br>
 In the above reaction, if, at equilibrium, N2O4 is added, the system moves to the right, i.e. some N2O4 changes to NO2 until equilibrium is reached.<br>
 In the above reaction, if, at equilibrium, N2O4 is removed, the system moves to the left, i.e. some NO2 changes to N2O4 until equilibrium is reached.<br>
 Position at equilibrium can shift if the temperature changes, but it will not shift, because solid is added or removed from a system.<br>
 Position at equilibrium does not change if a catalyst is added to the reaction, but if the system is not at equilibrium it will reach equilibrium quicker, because of the influence of the catalyst.<br>
5. Le Chatelier's principle states that if the conditions of a system at equilibrium are altered, changes will occur in the system towards counteracting the change in conditions, when a system in equilibrium is subjected to a change in conditions, it adjusts itself so as to oppose that change.<br>
 Henri Le Chatelier (1850 - 1936).<br>
If a stress is applied to a system in dynamic equilibrium, the system behaves in a way that relieves the stress.<br>
6. The law of chemical equilibrium (law of mass action)<br>
 For reaction aA + bB &lt;--> eE + fF (lower case = number of species, upper case = different types of species, e.g. 3 species of oxygen gas = 3O2) at equilibrium:<br>[E]<sup>e</sup> × [F]<sup>f</sup> / [A]<sup>a</sup> × [B]<sup>b</sup>= K, where K is the<br>equilibrium constant of that reaction at that temperature.<br>

Effect of alteration of concentration<br>
 Reaction: A + B --> C + D<br>
 A chemical reaction may stop although some of the reacting substances remain.<br>
 If A and B are the reacting substances and C and D are the resulting substances, an equilibrium occurs with some A and B remaining unchanged and some C and D formed.<br>
 Initially A and B react at a rate that depends on their concentrations.<br>
 A change in the concentration of either A or B produces a change in the rate of the reaction.<br>
 The rate of the forward action is proportional to the product of the concentrations of A and B, so rate of reaction of A and B is proportional to (Concentration of A) × (Concentration of B) =<br>k1 (Concentration
 of A) × (Concentration of B).<br>
 However, as soon as A and B react, their concentrations decrease, so the rate of reaction continuously decreases.<br>
 The reaction between A and B will have formed some C and D, and the concentrations of A B will increase and in turn react to form A and B with the rate of reaction proportional to the product of<br>their 
concentrations.<br>
 Rate of reaction of C and D is proportional to (Concentration of C) × (Concentrationof D) = k2 (Concentration of C) × (Concentration of D).<br>
 When there is apparently no further action, an equilibrium is reached with the rate of reaction of A and B forming C and D, equal to the rate of reaction of C and D forming A and B.<br>
 At equilibrium, k1 (Concentration of A) × (Concentration of B) = k2 (Concentration of C) × (Concentration of D).<br>
 k1 / k2 = the equilibrium constant, k.<br>
At equilibrium, the product of the concentrations of C and D, divided by the product of the concentrations of A and B has a definite value.<br>
 So if at equilibrium the concentration of A is increased by adding of more of it, the concentrations of B, C, and D will assume new values, but the value of the expression (K) will remain unchanged.<br>
 This will involve the combination of some A and B to form more C and D, i.e., the previous equilibrium concentration of B will be decreased and those of C and D will be increased.<br>

Hydrogen peroxide may be sold in pharmacies in two strengths as follows:<br>
1. 3% aqueous solution w / v, 3 g / mL, 10 volume, 10 vols (10% volume)<br>
2. 6% aqueous solution w / v, 6 g / mL, 20 volume = 20 vols (20% volume)<br>
The strength of an aqueous solution is represented by the volumes of oxygen that 100 cm<sup>3</sup> of the liquid solution will give on decomposition.<br>
So a 20 volume concentration means that when 1 volume of hydrogen peroxide solution is decomposed, it produces 20 volumes of oxygen.<br>
As a hydrogen peroxide 20 volume solution contains 6% H2O2, 60g of H2O2 in 1000g of solution.<br>
Atomic mass of H2O2 (H atomic mass 1.008, oxygen atomic mass 16) = 34.016, so the concentration of a 20 volume solution is 60 / 34.016 = 1.76 m.<br>
The smaller concentration, 3% w / v H2O2, is less stable and decomposes faster at room temperatures, so the actual concentration is probably less than 3%.<br>
