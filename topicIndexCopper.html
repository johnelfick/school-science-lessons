Copper is a metallic element used for coin alloys, electrical wiring, heating vessels, jewellery, roofing material for domes, conducting electricity and lightning conductors.<br>
It is the only red or red-brown metal.<br>
Its alloys include brass (copper and zinc), bronze (copper and tin), and in copper coins.<br>
Copper, Cu (cuprum) is a bright red-orange, ductile, malleable and ductile transition metal, with high electrical and thermal conductivity.<br>
It is obtained form cuprite, Cu2S.<br>
It is available as ingots, filings, foil, powder, turnings, nails, wire, turnings.<br>
It becomes dull when exposed to air, and in moist air becomes coated with verdis blue or green, basic copper carbonate.<br>
It is an excellent conductor of heat.<br>
It is extracted from cuprite Cu2S and malachite (basic copper (II) carbonate), Cu2CO3(OH)2.<br>
Aqueous copper ion, Cu<sup>2+</sup> is blue.<br>
Most Cu<sup>+</sup> compounds are white, but copper (I) oxide is brick red.<br>
It reacts with concentrated oxidizing acids, HNO3 or H2SO4 to produce high oxidation number ions, and sulfur dioxide SO2 or nitrogen dioxide, NO2.<br>
No reaction with dilute HCl or H2SO4 or with water.<br>
It can be attacked by mineral acids, e.g. hydrochloric and sulfuric acids and organic acids, e.g. acetic acid.<br>
It is soluble in dilute ammonia.<br>
It is incompatible with alkali solutions, sodium azide and acetylene.<br>
It reacts with strong oxidants, e.g. chlorates, bromates and iodates, to cause an explosion hazard.<br>
The heated powder forms an oxide.<br>
Copper deficiency may occur in infants fed only on cow's milk.<br>
Copper bracelets may alleviate, but not cure, arthritis.<br>
A copper bowl may be preferable for beating cream.<br>
Copper poisoning may occur from water standing for a long time in copper pipes or copper hot water service.<br>
It is a cofactor for many enzymes and proteins, and is used in the development of nerve, bone, blood and connective tissue.<br>
It competes with zinc for entry from the intestines, so an increase in dietary zinc may result in copper deficiency.<br>
The recommended daily allowance, RDA, is 1.5 to 3.0 mg.<br>

The surface of the coin will be cleaned, and a blue solution of either copper sulfate or copper nitrate forms.<br>
The surfaces of copper coins in everyday use become black with age, because copper combines with oxygen and hydrogen sulfide gases in the atmosphere to form copper oxide and copper sulfide,<br>which are both black.<br>
The black coating can be removed and the discoloured coin made bright and shiny by warming with dilute nitric acid.<br>
Dilute sulfuric acid will dissolve the copper oxide, but not the copper sulfide.<br>

1. Heat a piece of brass in a test-tube half full of dilute nitric acid.<br>
Effervescence begins.<br>
Observe the brown-yellow gas in the test-tube.<br>
At the same time a green-blue solution of copper nitrate forms.<br>
Let the action continue for five minutes and then pour the solution into an eggcup.<br>
Put a clean penknife blade into the solution.<br>
A deposit of pure copper forms on the blade.<br>
The gas is a mixture of colourless nitrogen tetroxide, nitrogen peroxide, N2O4 with red-brown nitrogen dioxide, NO2.<br>
N2O4 &lt;--> 2NO2.<br>
2. This experiment can also be done with a small copper coin.<br>
Warm a small piece of brass or a few bits of brass wire in a test-tube half full of dilute nitric acid, using only a small flame.<br>
Soon effervescence will begin and a brown gas, nitrogen peroxide, will be seen in the tube.<br>
At the same time a green-blue solution of copper nitrate forms.<br>
Allow the action to proceed for about five minutes and then pour the solution into an egg cup.<br>
Put a clean penknife blade into the solution.<br>
A deposit of pure copper forms on the blade.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.7.11.0H">12.7.11.0</a> Tests for copper wire with a flame test<br>
Dip the end of a copper wire into an iodine solution or tincture of iodine, then into the edge of a flame.<br>
Observe a blue-green colour of the flame, a beautiful appearance in the dark.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.7.11.1H">12.7.11.1</a> Prepare copper from copper oxide<br>
Mix one part of copper oxide, sodium bicarbonate or powdered washing soda, and two parts of sugar.<br>
Put a small amount of the mixture into a small metal screw-cap or on to a tin lid.<br>
Heat the mixture over a medium Bunsen flame.<br>
The mixture swells up and forms a copper-coloured mass.<br>
To obtain the copper from the mass allow the screw-cap or lid to cool and powder the copper-coloured residue.<br>
Put the powder into a test-tube and warm it for a few minutes with a little dilute sulfuric acid or sodium bisulfate solution.<br>
Pour away the contents of the tube except for the small amount of solid left at the bottom of the tube.<br>
This solid contains small particles of metallic copper.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.7.11.2H">12.7.11.2</a> Prepare copper (II) sulfate crystals with copper oxide<br>
When black copper oxide is warmed with dilute sulfuric acid, it is converted into a blue solution of copper sulfate.<br>
Half fill a test-tube with dilute sulfuric acid.<br>
Holding the tube in a paper holder, warm it over a small flame until the liquid nearly begins to boil.<br>
Then add a pinch of copper oxide from a salt spoon to the tube.<br>
The black powder will dissolve.<br>
Warm the tube again and add a further pinch of copper oxide.<br>
This also will dissolve.<br>
Continue the adding of small amounts of copper oxide and warming until a black sediment of copper oxide stays at the bottom of the tube, even after warming.<br>
Filter the blue solution into an evaporating dish and leave it to evaporate in the bottom of the airing cupboard.<br>
Blue crystals of copper sulfate will be deposited in a few hours on the bottom of the dish.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.7.11.5H">12.7.11.5</a> Prepare copper from copper sulfate<br>
1. Shake iron filings with 2 cm of blue vitriol solution in a test-tube for a few minutes.<br>
The colour of the solution will fade, and, if the shaking is continued long enough, will disappear.<br>
Filter the contents of the tube.<br>
Note the red-brown powder left in the filter paper.<br>
copper sulfate + iron --> copper + iron sulfate<br>
The red-brown powder is not pure copper, because excess of iron filings have been used, so it is a mixture of copper and excess iron filings coated with copper.<br>
2. Repeat the experiment using a piece of lead instead of iron filings.<br>
After cleaning the lead rub it with sandpaper and then immerse it in hot copper sulfate solution.<br>
The heat is necessary, because the action is slow in the cold.<br>
A film of copper will be deposited on the lead.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.7.11.7H">12.7.11.7</a> Prepare copper (I) oxide with golden syrup<br>
1. Add sodium hydroxide solution to 2 cm of copper (II) sulfate solution.<br>
A blue jelly-like precipitate of copper hydroxide forms.<br>
Stir golden syrup on the end of a spoon into a little hot water until it has dissolved.<br>
Add 2 cm of this solution to the copper hydroxide precipitate in the test-tube.<br>
Heat the test-tube gently.<br>
A yellow precipitate of copper (I) oxide, CuO, forms in the test-tube.<br>
The colour gradually changes to orange.<br>
Filter off the precipitate.<br>
The copper (I) oxide is left in the filter paper turns red, its usual colour.<br>
2. Repeat the experiment with a solution of black treacle, or the sweet sold as "barley sugar".<br>
These foods contain glucose.<br>
This chemical action may be used as a test for glucose.<br>
3. Use the solution to test on a cut apple for glucose.<br>
Heat small pieces of the apple with water.<br>
After filtering the liquid, use it in the same way as described for the golden syrup solution above.<br>
2NaOH (aq) + CuSO4 (aq) --> Na2SO4 (aq) + Cu(OH)2 (s).<br>

Copper (II) sulfate with ammonium chloride<br>
Add 1 mL of powdered copper (II) sulfate and 1 mL of ammonium chloride to a test-tube nearly full of water.<br>
Dissolve the substances by holding the thumb over the end of the test-tube and shake the test-tube upside.<br>
Use a small paint brush to write on a piece of paper with the faint blue solution.<br>
When the writing has dried, it is invisible.<br>
Warm the paper in front of a flame to make the writing appear in yellow letters.<br>
CuSO4.5H2O + 2NH4Cl --> (NH4)2SO4 + CuCl2 + 5H2O<br>
Copper (II) chloride solution is green-blue.<br>

Make a strong solution of copper sulfate by heating 1 cm of the powder with 2 cm of water in a test-tube.<br>
When the powder has dissolved, cool the test-tube under the tap.<br>
Pour drops of methylated spirits into the test-tube.<br>
A shower of very small crystals of copper sulfate precipitates in the test-tube, because copper sulfate is insoluble in methylated spirit.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.15.3.1H">12.15.3.1</a> Prepare iron sulfate with copper (II) sulfate solution<br>
1. Shake 2 mL of iron filings with 4 cm of copper sulfate solution in a test-tube for a few minutes.<br>
The colour of the solution will fade.<br>
If the shaking continued for long enough the colour disappears.<br>
Filter the contents of the test-tube.<br>
A red-brown powder is left in the filter paper as the more reactive Fe, displaces Cu to form FeSO4 and Cu.<br>
Fe (s) + CuSO4 (aq) --> FeSO4 (aq) + Cu (s)<br>
iron + copper sulfate --> iron (II) sulfate + copper<br>
The red-brown powder is not pure copper, because as excess iron filings are used in the experiment it is a mixture of copper and excess iron filings coated with copper.<br>

Zinc metal can displace copper ions from a solution of copper (II) sulfate.<br>
Add excess zinc powder to copper (II) sulfate solution.<br>
Zn (s) + CuSO4 --> ZnSO4 + Cu<br>
Zn (s) + Cu<sup>2+</sup> (aq) --> Zn<sup>2+</sup> (aq) + Cu (s)<br>
Zn (s) + Cu<sup>2+</sup> (aq) + SO4<sup>2-</sup> (aq) -->

After cleaning the lead, rub it with sandpaper, then immerse it in very hot copper sulfate solution.<br>
The heat is necessary, because the action is slow in the cold.<br>
A film of copper deposits on the lead.<br>
Pb (s) + Cu<sup>2+</sup> (aq) + SO4<sup>2-</sup> (aq) --> Pb<sup>2+</sup> (aq) + SO4<sup>2-</sup> (aq) + Cu (s)<br>
Pb<sup>2+</sup> (aq) + SO4<sup>2-</sup> (aq) --> PbSO4 (s)<br>
However, the lead sulfate is insoluble in the solution and rapidly forms a layer on the lead strip.<br>
So most people think no reaction occurs.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.15.4H">12.15.4</a> Prepare copper (II) carbonate and copper (II) oxide<br>
Add 2 cm of copper sulfate solution to 2 cm of sodium carbonate solution.<br>
A blue-green precipitate of copper carbonate forms in the double decomposition reaction<br>
Filter the precipitate, and with a spill transfer it to a metal lid.
Hold the lid in a pair of pliers and warm it gently over a small flame.<br>
The green colour copper (II) carbonate will change to black, because of formation of black copper (II) oxide.<br>
2Na<sup>+</sup> + SO4<sup>2-</sup> + Cu<sup>2+</sup> + CO3<sup>2</sup><sup>-</sup> --> Na2SO4 + CuCO3<br>
Na2CO3 + CuSO4 --> Na2SO4 + CuCO3<br>
sodium carbonate + copper sulfate --> sodium sulfate + copper (II) carbonate<br>
Another explanation:<br>
2Na2CO3 +2CuSO4 + H2O --> 2Na2SO4 + Cu2(OH)2CO3 + CO2<br>
sodium carbonate + copper sulfate + water --> sodium sulfate + basic copper carbonate + carbon dioxide<br>
Cu2(OH)2CO3 = 2CuO + CO2+ H2O.<br>
