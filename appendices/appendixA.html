<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.1.0H">16.1.0</a> Amines<br>
Amines, (C2H5NH2), are produced by the decay of organic matter, ammonia-derivative organic compounds of nitrogen.<br>
In amine molecules one or more hydrogen atoms has been replaced by a hydrocarbon radical, an alkyl or aryl group.<br>
Amines are organic derivative of ammonia, where one, two or three hydrogen atoms are replaced by alkyl groups as a primary, secondary or tertiary amine.<br>
For example: <a href="#TrimethylamineH">Trimethylamine</a> (C3H9N).<br>
Amines usually act as weak bases that form ammonium salts that are more soluble in water than the original amine.<br>
Cough medicines may contain cough suppressant dextramethorphan hydrobromide or decongestant and expectorant, pseudoephidrine hydrochloride and ephedrine.<br>
Ethane is an important product of microbial metabolism.<br>
Amines, RNH2 (amino, -NH2), amine, e.g. methylamine (CH3NH2)<br>
Plant amines occur in most plant cells, formed by decarboxylation of amino acids or by transamination of aldehydes.<br>
There is no sharp distinction between plant amines and alkaloids.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.3.0H">16.3.0</a> Catecholamines<br>
The catecholamines, epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine are synthesized in the central nervous system, and central part of the adrenal gland.<br>
Catecholamines function as psychoactive compounds, hormones or neurotransmitters.<br>
Catecholamines are monoamines, which contain catechol (benzene with two OH side groups at carbons 1 and 2) and a side-chain amine.<br>
Catechol may be a free molecule or part of a larger molecule, e.g. the 1,2-dihydroxybenzenes.<br>
Catecholamines are derived from the amino acid tyrosine, C9H11NO3.<br>
Conversions activated by enzymes:<br>
Phenylalanine --> L-Tyrosine ---> L-DOPA ------> Dopamine -----> Norepinephrine --> Epinephrine<br>
C9H11NO2 ----> C9H11NO3 --> C9H11NO4 ---> C8H11NO2 ---> C8H11NO3 ------> C9H13NO3<br>

The classification systems in this document is based on: "Phytochemical Dictionary: A Handbook of Bioactive Compounds from Plants", Second Edition.<br>
by Herbert Baxter, J.B. Harborne, Gerald P. Moss, December 16, 1998, CRC Press, Taylor and Francis Group.<br>

ISBN 9780748406203 - CAT# TF2051<br>
Alkaloids are secondary metabolites, so are not essential to the organism, usually occurring in only a few vascular plants and some fungi.<br>
Alkaloids are complex organic bases of vegetable origin.<br>
Alkaloids are basic organic nitrogen compounds in plants with powerful action on animals, e.g. nicotine, morphine, quinine, strychnine.<br>
Alkaloids have the properties of amines and are natural bitter, alkaline, nitrogenous compounds.<br>
The names of alkaloids usually end in "ine".<br>
The function of alkaloids is probably to defend against grazing animals or being eaten by insects.<br>
Many alkaloids are plant metabolic by-products derived from amino acids.<br>
More than 10 000 different alkaloids may exist in more than 300 plant families.<br>
Alkaloids usually contain at least one nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring structure, phenolic or indole rings.<br>
The term "alkaloid" was first used to describe chemical bases from plants used in medicines, but now there is no exact definition of alkaloids.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.5.0H">16.5.0</a> Alkaloid classifications<br>
Alkaloid classifications are usually based on structure or origin.<br>
<a name="16.3.1H">16.3.1</a> True alkaloids are derived from amino acids, have nitrogen in a heterocyclic ring, e.g. atropine.<br>
<a name="16.3.2H">16.3.2</a> Protoalkaloids are derived from amino acids, no nitrogen in a heterocyclic ring, e.g. Adrenaline, Ephedrine and Mescaline.<br>
<a name="16.3.3H">16.3.3</a> Pseudoalkaloids are not derived from amino acids, but have nitrogen in a heterocyclic ring, e.g. Caffeine.<br>

Tests for trimethylamine fish smell<br>
Trimethylamine, C3H9N, (CH3)3N, tertiary amine, colourless gas with fishlike odour at low concentrations changes to ammonia-like odour at higher concentrations.<br>
It dissolves in water to form flammable, corrosive clear to yellow aqueous solution, unconfined liquid can cause frostbite or chemical burns.<br> 
Prolonged exposure to heat can cause the containers of gas to rupture violently.<br>
 Fish smell problem<br>
 Proteins in raw fish are denatured by citric acid, lemon juice.<br>
 Freshly caught fish have no odour, but the end products of enzyme reactions in caught fish accumulate to give the characteristic fish smell.<br>
 If fish is not fresh, it give off trimethylamine, N(CH3)3, the source of fish smell, so the cooked fish is less tasty and the cooking smell is offensive.<br>
 Trimethylamine, CH3NCH3CH3, (TMA), volatile tertiary aliphatic amine, from food containing it or from precursors<br>
 trimethylthamine-N-oxide, and L-Carnitine, C7H15NO3, an amino acid derivative.<br>
 In humans, ingested TMA may convert to TMNO by N-oxidation, but this process and its importance is not well understood.<br>
 TMA is produced by bacteria in the human intestines, but it is broken down by oxidation in the liver.<br>
 The reaction requires a certain enzyme, but if people do not have the enzyme, due to a genetic fault, they may smell "fishy"!<br>
 They suffer from a metabolic disorder called Trimethylaminuria (TMAU).<br>
 They can be relieved of this embarrassing problem by avoiding foods rich in the amino alcohol choline.<br>
 Trimethylamine is found in beetroot and herrings, so some people say that beetroot has a "herring smell".<br>
 Experiment<br>
 Stopping fish smell when cooking fish<br>
 To stop fish smell, soak fish in soy bean paste or milk so that proteins in them absorb the smell.<br>
 Use ginger or green onion during cooking.<br>
 Lemon juice, vinegar, wine, and rice wine can neutralize fish fat, which contains trimethylamine.<br>
 Soak freshwater fish in vinegar water before cooking.<br>
 At the end of rigour mortis, bacterial action may decompose the fish protein and add to the offensive smell.<br>
 Fish should be eaten fresh and cooked for only a short time to denature tissue between the fibres and heat the fish to an acceptable temperature for eating.<br>
