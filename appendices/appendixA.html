<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.1.1H">16.1.1</a> Amines<br>
Amines, (C2H5NH2), are produced by the decay of organic matter, ammonia-derivative organic compounds of nitrogen.<br>
In amine molecules one or more hydrogen atoms has been replaced by a hydrocarbon radical, an alkyl or aryl group.<br>
Amines are organic derivative of ammonia, where one, two or three hydrogen atoms are replaced by alkyl groups as a primary, secondary or tertiary amine.<br>
For example: <a href="#16.2.25H">Trimethylamine</a> (C3H9N).<br>
Amines usually act as weak bases that form ammonium salts that are more soluble in water than the original amine.<br>
Cough medicines may contain cough suppressant dextramethorphan hydrobromide or decongestant and expectorant, pseudoephidrine hydrochloride and ephedrine.<br>
Ethane is an important product of microbial metabolism.<br>
Amines, RNH2 (amino, -NH2), amine, e.g. methylamine (CH3NH2)<br>
Plant amines occur in most plant cells, formed by decarboxylation of amino acids or by transamination of aldehydes.<br>
There is no sharp distinction between plant amines and alkaloids.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.1.2H">16.1.2</a> Primary amines<br>
In primary amines, one of three hydrogen atoms in ammonia is replaced by organic substituents.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.1.5H">16.1.5</a> Aromatic amines<br>
Aromatic amines have the nitrogen atom connected to an aromatic ring, as in aniline. <a href="#AnilineH">Aniline</a> (C6H5NH2)<br>
Heterocyclic aromatics have one or more of the atoms in the aromatic ring + an element other than carbon.<br>
Sometimes, aromatic amines are classified as alkaloids.<br>
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, (PAH), have simple aromatic rings fused together by sharing two carbon atoms, e.g. Benzene, Toluene, Ortho-xylene, Para-xylene.<br>
Most amines act as bases and are reasonably strong.<br>
Because amines are basic, they neutralize carboxylic acids to form corresponding ammonium carboxylate salts.<br>
Upon heating to 200 oC, the primary and secondary amine salts dehydrate to form corresponding amides.<br>
Aromatic amines include:<br>
<a href="#16.2.7H">Dopamine</a> (C8H11NO2)<br>

It dissolves in water to form flammable, corrosive clear to yellow aqueous solution, unconfined liquid can cause frostbite or chemical burns.<br> 
Prolonged exposure to heat can cause the containers of gas to rupture violently.<br>
 Fish smell problem<br>
 Proteins in raw fish are denatured by citric acid, lemon juice.<br>
 Freshly caught fish have no odour.<br>
 However, the end products of enzyme reactions accumulate when the fish is to give the characteristic fish smell.<br>
 If fish is not fresh, it give off trimethylamine, N(CH3)3, the source of fish smell.<br>
 The cooked fish is less tasty and the cooking smell is offensive.<br>
 Trimethylamine, CH3NCH3CH3, (TMA), volatile tertiary aliphatic amine, from food containing it or from precursors<br>
 trimethylthamine-N-oxide, and L-Carnitine, C7H15NO3, an amino acid derivative.<br>
 In humans, ingested TMA may convert to TMNO by N-oxidation, but this process and its importance is not well understood.<br>
 TMA is produced by bacteria in the human intestines, but it is broken down by oxidation in the liver.<br>
 The reaction requires a certain enzyme, but if people do not have the enzyme, due to a genetic fault, they may smell "fishy"!<br>
 They suffer from a metabolic disorder called Trimethylaminuria (TMAU).<br>
 They can be relieved of this embarrassing problem by avoiding foods rich in the amino alcohol choline.<br>
 Trimethylamine is found in beetroot and herrings, so some people say that beetroot has a "herring smell".<br>
<a name="16.2.33H"></a>
 Experiment<br>
 Stopping fish smell when cooking fish<br>
 To stop fish smell, soak fish in soy bean paste or milk so that proteins in them absorb the smell.<br>
 Use ginger or green onion during cooking.<br>
 Lemon juice, vinegar, wine, and rice wine can neutralize fish fat, which contains trimethylamine.<br>
 Soak freshwater fish in vinegar water before cooking.<br>
 At the end of rigour mortis, bacterial action may decompose the fish protein and add to the offensive smell.<br>
 Fish should be eaten fresh and cooked for only a short time to denature tissue between the fibres and heat the fish to an acceptable temperature for eating.<br>

The catecholamines, epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine, are synthesized in the central nervous system, and central part of the adrenal gland.<br>
Catecholamines function as psychoactive compounds, hormones or neurotransmitters.<br>

Phenylalanine --> L-Tyrosine ---> L-DOPA ------> Dopamine -----> Norepinephrine --> Epinephrine<br>
