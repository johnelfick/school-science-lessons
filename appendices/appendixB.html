Ziehl-Neelsen stain (acid-fast stain).<br>
Purchase: Carbol-Fuchsin solution according to Ziehl-Neelsen, for microscopy.<br>
Bacteria stain bright red due to retention of carbol-fuchsin dye.<br>
Background is methylene blue counter stain.<br>
It stains bright red mainly Mycobacteria, e.g. <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> that causes tuberculosis (TB).<br>
It contains carbol-fuchsin (aqueous solution of phenol + alcoholic solution of fuchsin), acid alcohol (ethanol and hydrochloric acid), and methylene blue.<br>
The acid-fast mycobacteria are usually straight rod-shaped bacilli, 1to 10 cm long by 0.2 to 0.6 cm wide.<br>
The high lipid content of their cell wall makes the bacteria resistant to penetration by many dyes and chemicals, including Gram stain.<br>
The procedure is to stain all the bacteria on the slide with hot carbol-fuchsin, then wash the slide with acid alcohol.<br>
The remaining bacteria that are still red are the "acid-fast bacteria".<br>
Then counter stain with methylene blue dye (Swiss blue), so that the acid-fast bacteria remain red, and any other bacteria are stained blue.<br>
