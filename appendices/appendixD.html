<a href="../images/16.3.5.1ch.gif">See diagram 16.3.5.1</a>: Recycling code<br>
 1. PETE, Polyethylene terephthalate, commonly recycled, relatively safe plastic designed for single use,<br>
 2. HDPE, High density polyethylene, commonly recycled, relatively safe plastic for use in food and drink containers,<br>
 3. PVC, Polyvinyl Chloride, Vinyl chloride, V, not commercially recycled, may contain and leach dangerous chemicals,<br>
 4. LDPE, Low density polyethylene, less commonly recycled, relatively safe plastic for use in food and drink containers,<br>
 5. PP, Polypropylene, not commercially recycled, relatively safe plastic for use in food and drink containers,<br>
 6. PS, Polystyrene, not commercially recycled, may contain and leach dangerous chemicals,<br>
 7. PC or Other, Polycarbonates, layered or mixed plastic, no recycling potential, disposed of by land fill, may contain / leach dangerous chemicals.<br>
 * Uncoded plastics are not usually recycled, but disposed of in land fills.<br>
 8. Avoid putting the following into recycling bins:<br>
 8.1 Soft plastics, e.g. cling wrap, bubble wrap, biscuit trays, potato chip packets, drinking straws, plastic coffee cups.<br>
 Avoid any plastics which can be scrunched into a ball in the fist.<br>
 8.2 Plastic coat hangers damage recycling machinery.<br>
 8.3 Paper towels reduce the quality of recycled paper and are a health issues for recycling workers.<br>
 8.4 Photographs contain damaging chemicals.<br>
 8.5 Plastic bags damage recycling machinery, so do not store recyclable items, e.g. plastic bottles, in plastic bags.<br>
Note: Plastics recycling code, ASTM, Resin Identification Code<br>
ASTM International, (the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), proposes to replace the chasing arrows with solid equatorial triangles.<br> 
The codes from the Society of the Plastics Industry are found on the bottom of plastic packaging.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.9.1H">3.9.1</a> Composite materials, reinforced plastics<br>
Composite materials are made by combining a thermosetting resin, e.g. polyester or epoxy resins, with a reinforced base, e.g. fibre glass, carbon fibre.<br>
The combination increases mechanical resistance to manufactured goods, e.g. car bodies, boats, aircraft and bicycle frames.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.0.0H">3.0.0</a> Resins and gums<br>
 Resins are flammable aromatic substances found mainly in the resin ducts of conifers, which contain organic polymers and terpenoids.<br>
 They may be extruded naturally or by incision, then become sticky or hard.<br>
 Unlike gums, they are insoluble in water.<br>
 Any synthetic materials resembling resins may be called "resins" or "synthetic resins", e.g. phenol resins, (Bakelite), epoxy resins.<br>
 They may be solid or liquid and thermosetting or thermoplastic.<br>
 Synthetic resins are used to make plastics.<br>
 Resinoids are synthetic resins that are thermosetting or not permanently solid or fusible.<br>

1. Polymers are large molecules built up by repetition of small and simple chemical units called monomers.<br>
For example, (+) glucose is the unit of starch, and ethylene, (ethene), is the unit of polythene.<br>
Polymers are long chain molecules from polymerization, combination by step-by-step repetition of groups of atoms, repeat units, e.g. -CO-O- in polyesters.<br>
The chain length of polythene is about five thousand ethene units.<br>
The mechanical properties of polymers depend on their molecular size.<br>
Polymers melt at a characteristic temperature that may be changed by impurities and additives.<br>
Some forms of polystyrene and polypropylene can crystallize to change their properties, to increase their density and contract more after moulding.<br>
Regular polymers may crystallize and cool from the melt so quickly to allow crystallization,<br> 
For example, polyethylene terephthalate film is amorphous owing to cooling at a high rate.<br>
The two main categories of polymers, 1. thermoplastics and 2. thermosetting resins, are based on molecular structure and their behaviour on heating.<br>
 2. Synthetic polymers are formed by chemical reactions for making plastics where monomers are joined by polymerization and condensation.<br>
 3. Homopolymers form from the same monomer, e.g. ethene, CH2CH2, is polymerized to form polyethene, (polyethylene), -CH2-CH2-CH2-.<br>
 4. <a name="HeteropolymersH">Heteropolymers</a>, (copolymers), are made from different monomers.<br>
For example, ABS plastics are made from acrylonitrile, butadiene, and styrene copolymers.<br>
 ABS is the generic name for plastics made from Acrylonitrile,  Butadiene and Styrene units.<br>
 5. Synthetic resins are polymer compounds before curing.<br>
 6. Natural products, cellulose in wood and cotton, horn, rosins, raw.<br>
 7. Converted natural products, vulcanized, vulcanized fibre, celluloid, (cellulose nitrate), casein plastic, (artificial horn).<br>

 "Thermoplastic Polymer, polycaprolactone", (commercial)<br>
 When thermoplastic is dyed, no chemical reaction occurs and moulding is not irreversible.<br>
 Thermoplastics can be returned to their plastic state and back to a solid state, without losing their characteristic.<br>
 Thermoplastic polymers, thermosoftening plastic, have long chain molecules that soften on heating and harden on cooling without chemical change.<br>
 They can be melted and moulded again and again.<br>
 This plastic is heated to soften it, then squeezed to fuse it and to shape it by viscous flow.<br>
 Most polymers are thermoplastics.<br>
 They usually have high molecular weight with weak Van der Waals bonds between molecule chains that can be broken by heating.<br>

 Thermosetting polymers are polycondensed material.<br>
 During manufacture when it is heated and subjected to pressure, a chemical reaction occurs provoking a restructuring that is molecularly irreversible.<br>
 Once formed, a thermosetting resin is unchangeable.<br>
 Thermosetting polymers are extensively cross-linked to form 3-D networks that does not soften much on heating.<br>
 A network of strong covalent bonds forms during the initial curing so the material cannot be remoulded.<br>
 Thermosetting plastics have rigid cross-linked molecules, resist high temperatures, cannot be softened after curing.<br>
 Insoluble, hard and brittle substances.<br>
 They are polymers that once formed does not melt on heating, charring instead.<br>
 Its structure has cross-linking from one chain to the next produced by chemical curing.<br>
 The thermosets that cannot be recycled include:
Phenol resins, (Bakelite), epoxy resins, melamine-formaldehyde resin, polyimides, polyesters, silicones, fibreglass, urea-formaldehyde foam,  polyurethanes.<br>
 Thermosetting resins include phenolic, melamine, urea and polyester resins.<br>
 Cross-linking of polymers chains occurs while resins are moulded, resulting in high temperature stability and network of covalent bonds between chains.<br>
 They cannot be melted or recycled, because they are resistant to further heating up to charring point.<br>
Experiment<br>
Prepare a thermoset plastic bar<br>
Use latex gloves, goggles and aprons for this experiment.<br>

 Addition polymerization occurs when identical monomers link under high temperature and pressure.<br>
 The reactive group is the carbon to carbon double bond [C=C].<br>
 For example, many units of ethylene, (ethene [CH2=CH2]), combine to form polyethene, (polythene), [-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-].<br>
 That is the only product of the reaction and it has no definite chemical formula.<br>
 For example, phenylethene polymerizes to form poly(phenylethene), polystyrene, styrene.<br>
 Addition polymers are called thermoplastic, (thermosoftening), polymers, because they melt easily.<br>
 They may be recycled, because they can be melted and used again but, when they burn, they may form poisonous gases.<br>
 Addition polymerization, is activating monomer molecules with a catalyst, benzoyl peroxide. that splits to give two free radicals.<br> 
They react with a monomer to form another free radical, (initiation), and it reacts with more monomers to form a polymer chain.<br>
 The two free radicals react together to stop the reaction or react with another chain to form branching chains.<br>

 This continuous process is used for the production of semifinished goods such as films, sheet profiles, tubes and pipes, and sheathing of cables.<br>
 The goods are called "semi-finished", because they must be further processed before they become useful articles.<br>
 The thermoplastic raw material for the extruder is supplied as, a powder or in granule form.<br>
 The screw turns in the heated cylinder and forces the material forward while it compacts, plasticizes, (melts), and homogenizes it.<br>
 A die is placed at the end of the cylinder that moulds the emerging plastic mass into the desired shape of pipe, sheet or other form.<br>
 The operation is, in principle, the same as that of a meat mincer with the addition of heaters in the wall of the extruder and the length of the deeply cut screw of the extruder is much greater than that of the 
mincer screw.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.2.01H">3.2.0</a> Injection moulding<br>
 This process is very widespread, because it can produce mouldings of high quality and with great accuracy, generally without requiring any further work.<br>
 It is used predominantly for thermoplastics but smaller amounts of thermosets and elastomers are processed this way.<br>
 The injection moulding machine consists of an injection unit and a mould that can be opened.<br>
 The injection unit is really an extruder with a screw that can be moved backwards and forwards.<br>
 It works by plasticizing the material as the screw rotates and moves backwards and then forces the molten material out into the mould as the screw is driven forward.<br>
 Injection moulding machine<br>
 The mould is closed and its cavities are filled with the molten plastic injected by the screw.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.3.01H">3.3.01</a> Blow moulding<br>
 The process is used for moulding hollow articles in thermoplastics.<br>
 An extruder forces the plastic tube vertically downwards between the two halves of an open two part mould.<br>
 The closing of the mould squeezes an air-tight seal at the top and the bottom, then compressed air is blown into the plastic tube forcing out against the wall of the mould cavity while it cools to form a hollow
 article, e.g. a bottle.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.4.01H">3.4.01</a> Rotational moulding<br>
 This process is simple in concept.<br>
 Heat is used to melt and fuse a plastic resin in a closed mould.<br>
 No pressure is involved.<br>
 The three stage process includes loading the resin in the mould, heating and fusion of the resin and cooling and unloading the mould.<br>
 After the charged mould is placed in an oven, the mould is rotated on two axes at low speed.<br>
 As heat penetrates the mould the resin adheres to the inner surface until it is completely fused.<br>
 The mould is then cooled by air or water spray, or a combination of both, while still rotating, lowering the temperature gradually.<br>
 The mould is opened, the finished part removed and the mould is recharged for the next cycle.<br>
 Rotationally moulded products include shipping drums, storage tanks and receptacles, material handling bins and fuel tanks.<br>
 Consumer products include furniture, light shades, toys, surfboards and marine accessories.<br>

 They are also used in car interiors, children's and doll's prams, decorative sheeting, light fittings, wallpaper, and flooring sheeting for garden furniture.<br>
 The most important application of this process is in the production of PVC sheeting and in the coating of fabric.<br>

 <a href="../images/16.3.4.10ch.gif">See diagram 16.3.4.10</a>: Polyurethane<br>
 The inclusion of air or gases in the structure of foamed materials reduces their density.<br>
 One method involves mixing compressed air or gas into the plastic mass, and on subsequent processing the gas is liberated and forms a foam.<br>
 In another important method, a 'blowing agent' such as sodium bicarbonate is added to the plastic raw materials.<br>
 When the hot melt is formed the sodium bicarbonate decomposes, giving off carbon dioxide gas, which forms bubbles in the foam.<br>
 The bubbles are fixed on solidification and they confer a light density on the material.<br>
 Recently, foamed materials have become more and more important in trade and industry, not least, because so many polymers can be expanded in the ways mentioned.<br>
 They include polyethylene, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, (PVC), phenolic, urea, epoxide, polyester, and polyurethanes in rigid and flexible forms.<br>
 Plastics foams can be manufactured not only by special methods, but also by injection moulding, extrusion and calendering.<br>
