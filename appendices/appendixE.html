Dioxin, C4H4O2, 1,2-Dioxin, o-Dioxin, 1,2-Dioxacyclohexadiene, was first used to kill noxious weeds, e.g. privet and blackberry.<br>
At first it caused birth defects in animals and chloracne rash in workers due to a dioxin impurity C12H4Cl4O2, (2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin), (TCDD).<br>
This impurity occurs as white crystals or tan crystalline powder and can cause cancer according to The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).<br>
Agent Orange was used first by the UK military in Malaysia and later by the US military to defoliate jungle regions in Vietnam.<br>
PCBs, polychlorinated biphenyls, are mixtures of up to 209 individual chlorinated compounds, called congeners.<br>
PCBs have no known smell or taste and the manufacture was stopped in the U.S. in 1977, because they build up in the environment and can cause harmful health effects.<br>

 Asphalt, (bitumen tar pitch), is black plastic solid from the final residues left after volatile substances are removed by fractional distillation of the petroleum of natural occurrence.<br>
 It is used for road construction and sealing roofs.<br>
 Asphalt is a natural organic material, often occurring in tar pits, with a hydrocarbon base that softens with heat and has been used for thousands of years for basins, impermeable water ways, sealing roof shingles, 
 and caulking wooden ships.<br>
 English sailors on naval sailing ships were called "tars", from their use of tar for waterproofing.<br>
 Bitumen is any naturally occurring asphalt or any black, viscous hydrocarbon mixture.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="BeveragecanH">Beverage can</a><br>
<a href="../physics/UNPh12.html#12.4.0H">Beverage can</a>, Beer can, (Experiments)<br>
 Beverage, prepared drink, but not water, e.g. tea, soft drink, alcoholic drink.<br>
 Beverage can, aluminium can, beer can, "can", drink can, drinking can, soda pop can, soft drink can, tin-plated steel can<br>
 1. Beverage cans are usually cylindrical containers made of aluminium or tin-plated steel in which food and drink can be stored and hermetically sealed.<br>
 2. The sizes and composition of the walls of the can may vary as follows:<br>
 2.1 USA and Canada, "aluminium cans", 355 mL, 92-97% Al, &lt;5.5% Mg, &lt;1.5%, Mn, &lt;0.15 % Co.<br>
 The empty beverage can weight is 15 g.<br>
 2.2 Australia, 375 mL<br>
 2.3 Europe, China, India, 330 mL<br>
 3. Aluminium is highly suitable as a packaging material for beverages, but have a protective epoxy resin polymer coating applied on the inside to prolong storage life so acids and salts in certain foods
 or beverages do not contact the metal.<br>
 4. Aluminium does not corrode easily.<br>
 5. Aluminium has density 2.70 g / cm 3, compared with steel 7.86 g / cm 3, so it is very light and cuts down on transport costs.<br>
 6. Aluminium transfers heat 2.4 times faster than iron, and very thin sheets can be produced, so heat is lost and gained by aluminium very quickly, giving it ideal qualities for cooking and as a cold drink 
 container.<br>
 7. Aluminium can be rolled into extremely thin foil, and can be cast and joined, yet still retain much of its strength, so less of it is needed as a light packaging material.<br>
 8. Aluminium has melting point of 660 oC, compared with 154 oC for iron, so less energy is required for processing and recycling it.<br>
 9. The lids of beverage cans may be a different composition than the cup portion of the can.<br>
10. The history of opening beverage cans<br>
 * Knife or bayonets were first used to open hermetically-sealed cans at home and during military service.<br>
 * Can piercers church keys used a lever action to dig a triangular hole in the top of the beverage can with the cut metal being pushed inside the can.<br>
 *. "Pull tabs", ring pulls, pulled of a section of the top of the beverage can, so that the ring and cut metal piece became detached.<br>
 However the separated pull tabs became an environmental hazard, and the opening in the top of the beverage can had sharp edges, so adolescents could use them as dangerous rings on small fingers.<br>
 Some old people did not have the strength or dexterity to use pull tabs.<br>
 "Push tabs" detached an opening in the top of the can by pressing down, but people could cut their fingers on the cut metal.<br>
 * "Stay-tabs", stay-on tabs, pop-tabs, are favoured nowadays, because they are easy to use, and cannot be detached to cause pollution or injury.<br>
 11. Tapping a shaken soda pop can<br>
 To avoid an explosive emission of beverage and gas from a shaken soda pop can, some people lightly tap the side of the upright can before pulling on the pull tab.<br>
 This practice may be regarded as an urban myth.<br>
 Tapping may release some bubbles from adhering to the walls of the soda pop can to collect at the top of the beverage just inside the ring pull.<br>
 So when the drink-can is opened, these bubbles do not push through the beverage, but push out some beverage explosively.<br>
 The time taken for the tapping gives some time for the carbon dioxide to dissolve back into the beverage, compared with a soda pop can being opened immediately after the shaking.<br>
 The beverage is emitted less forcefully if the soda pop can is opened very slowly, or put back in the refrigerator to increase the absorption of carbon dioxide.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="BirdlimeH">Birdlime</a><br>
 Birdlime, bird lime, comes from the inner bark of holly mistletoe or elm branches, boiled, then evaporated, to form a sticky substance, used to trap small birds.<br>
 Its use is illegal in many countries.<br>
 Birdlime is not "lime", calcium oxide.<br>
 The latex of breadfruit was formerly used as birdlime to catch birds by people in the South Pacific region.<br>

 Buffers<br>
A buffer or buffer solution is a mixture of substances that tend to hinder large changes in acid or basic properties of a solution.<br>
 The term "buffer" is used in a more general sense outside chemistry.<br>
 The pH of a buffer solution is not greatly changed by the addition of an acid or an alkali.<br>
 Most buffer solutions are a mixture of a weak acid or base with one of its salts.<br>
 In body fluids, the buffers include (H2CO3) with (HCO3 - ).<br>
 Acidic buffer, e.g. sodium hydrogen carbonate with carbonic acid solutions, the salt of the weak acid is completely dissociated into ions, but the weak acid is only partly dissociated.<br>
 Basic buffer, e.g. ammonium chloride in ammonia solutions.<br>

 When a candle is blown out a glowing ember usually remains in the wick

 The wicks of trick candles contain particles of magnesium powder, which 
 may be ignited by the glowing ember to then ignite any

 Look closely at the wick of a trick candle just before it reignites to
 see sparks of burning magnesium powder.<br>
 Only the magnesium in the glowing ember ignites, so the trick candle 
can be blown out then reignites many times, because the 
 magnesium in the rest of the wick does not burn, being isolated from 
the air by the liquid paraffin.<br>

"Cool Blue Light Kit", luminol, chemiluminescence, forensic science, (toy product)<br>
"Cool Chemical Light Powder", luminol (toy product)<br>
Luminol is used to detect copper, iron, peroxides and cyanides.<br>
The chemical luminol, 3-aminophthalhydrazide, C8H7N3O2, reacts with oxygen to produce an intermediate molecule, metal chelate.br>
It releases energy as blue-green luminescence when oxidized in alkaline solution.<br>
It has low solubility in water and is a yellow grainy substance.<br>
When luminol is placed in a basic solution such as a permanganate, hypochlorite or hydrogen peroxide, with a metal catalyst, e.g. cobalt, the luminol is oxidized.<br>
The two nitrogen atoms are replaced by two oxygen atoms and nitrogen gas is discharged, leaving the luminol in an excited state with additional energy.<br>
It is then released as light amino acids, and serum albumin can also react with luminol to produce blue-green light.<br>
So luminol is used in biology and biochemistry for testing and for the detection of blood for forensic science.<br>
Blood is slightly alkaline and contains haemoglobin, which contains iron.<br>
Luminol can detect very small amounts of blood, even if many years old.<br>
