 Asphalt, (bitumen tar pitch), is black plastic solid from the final residues left after volatile substances are removed by fractional distillation of the petroleum of natural occurrence.<br>
 It is used for road construction and sealing roofs.<br>
 Asphalt is a natural organic material, often occurring in tar pits, with a hydrocarbon base that softens with heat and has been used for thousands of years for basins, impermeable water ways, sealing roof shingles, 
 and caulking wooden ships.<br>
 English sailors on naval sailing ships were called "tars", from their use of tar for waterproofing.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="BeveragecanH">Beverage can</a><br>
<a href="../physics/UNPh12.html#12.4.0H">Beverage can</a>, Beer can, (Experiments)<br>
 Beverage, prepared drink, but not water, e.g. tea, soft drink, alcoholic drink.<br>
 Beverage can, aluminium can, beer can, "can", drink can, drinking can, soda pop can, soft drink can, tin-plated steel can<br>
 1. Beverage cans are usually cylindrical containers made of aluminium or tin-plated steel in which food and drink can be stored and hermetically sealed.<br>
 2. The sizes and composition of the walls of the can may vary as follows:<br>
 2.1 USA and Canada, "aluminium cans", 355 mL, 92-97% Al, &lt;5.5% Mg , &lt;1.5%, Mn, &lt;0.15 % Co.<br>
 The empty beverage can weight is 15 g.<br>
 2.2 Australia, 375 mL<br>
 2.3 Europe, China, India, 330 mL<br>
 3. Aluminium is highly suitable as a packaging material for beverages, but have a protective epoxy resin polymer coating applied on the inside to prolong storage life so acids and salts in certain foods
 or beverages do not contact the metal.<br>
 4. Aluminium does not corrode easily.<br>
 5. Aluminium has density 2.70 g / cm<sup>3</sup>, compared with steel 7.86 g / cm<sup>3</sup>, so it is very light and cuts down on transport costs.<br>
 6. Aluminium transfers heat 2.4 times faster than iron, and very thin sheets can be produced, so heat is lost and gained by aluminium very quickly, giving it ideal qualities for cooking and as a cold drink 
 container.<br>
 7. Aluminium can be rolled into extremely thin foil, and can be cast and joined, yet still retain much of its strength, so less of it is needed as a light packaging material.<br>
 8. Aluminium has melting point of 660<sup>o</sup>C, compared with 154<sup>o</sup>C for iron, so less energy is required for processing and recycling it.<br>
 9. The lids of beverage cans may be a different composition than the cup portion of the can.<br>
10. The history of opening beverage cans<br>
 * Knife or bayonets were first used to open hermetically-sealed cans at home and during military service.<br>
 * Can piercers church keys used a lever action to dig a triangular hole in the top of the beverage can with the cut metal being pushed inside the can.<br>
 *. "Pull tabs", ring pulls, pulled of a section of the top of the beverage can, so that the ring and cut metal piece became detached.<br>
 However the separated pull tabs became an environmental hazard, and the opening in the top of the beverage can had sharp edges, so adolescents could use them as dangerous rings on small fingers.<br>
 Some old people did not have the strength or dexterity to use pull tabs.<br>
 "Push tabs" detached an opening in the top of the can by pressing down, but people could cut their fingers on the cut metal.<br>
 * "Stay-tabs", stay-on tabs, pop-tabs, are favoured nowadays, because they are easy to use, and cannot be detached to cause pollution or injury.<br>
 11. Tapping a shaken soda pop can<br>
 To avoid an explosive emission of beverage and gas from a shaken soda pop can, some people lightly tap the side of the upright can before pulling on the pull tab.<br>
 This practice may be regarded as an urban myth.<br>
 Tapping may release some bubbles from adhering to the walls of the soda pop can to collect at the top of the beverage just inside the ring pull.<br>
 So when the drink-can is opened, these bubbles do not push through the beverage, but push out some beverage explosively.<br>
 The time taken for the tapping gives some time for the carbon dioxide to dissolve back into the beverage, compared with a soda pop can being opened immediately after the shaking.<br>
 The beverage is emitted less forcefully if the soda pop can is opened very slowly, or put back in the refrigerator to increase the absorption of carbon dioxide.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="BirdlimeH">Birdlime</a><br>
 Birdlime, bird lime, comes from the inner bark of holly mistletoe or elm branches, boiled, then evaporated, to form a sticky substance, used to trap small birds.<br>

 Buffers<br>
A buffer or buffer solution is a mixture of substances that tend to hinder large changes in acid or basic properties of a solution.<br>
 The term "buffer" is used in a more general sense outside chemistry.<br>
 The pH of a buffer solution is not greatly changed by the addition of  an acid or an alkali.<br>
 Most buffer solutions are a mixture of a weak acid or base with one of its salts.<br>
 In body fluids, the buffers include (H2CO3) with (HCO3<sup>-</sup>).<br>
 Acidic buffer, e.g. sodium hydrogen carbonate with carbonic acid solutions,  the salt of the weak acid is completely dissociated into ions, but the weak acid is only partly dissociated.<br>
 Basic buffer, e.g. ammonium chloride in ammonia solutions.<br>

 When a candle is blown out a glowing ember usually remains in the wick

 Look closely at the wick of a trick candle just before it reignites to
 see sparks of burning magnesium powder.<br>
 Only the magnesium in the glowing ember ignites, so the trick candle 
can be blown out then reignites many times, because the 
 magnesium in the rest of the wick does not burn, being isolated from 
the air by the liquid paraffin.<br>

 The first statin produced for sale was lovastatin, isolated from <i>Aspergillus
 terreus</i>.<br>
 Statins are synthetic lipid-lowering agents that lower cholesterol levels 
 by restricting the activity of enzyme HMG-CoA reductase essential for production of cholesterol in the liver.<br>
 Ischaemic heart disease will develop in more than one half of adults 
and continues to account for over one quarter of all deaths.<br>
 Mortality rises exponentially with increasing serum cholesterol.<br>
 Statins (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors) lower 
cholesterol very effectively and have a major role in the prevention of coronary and other arterial disease, in concert with attention 
 to other risk factors, in particular smoking, blood pressure and weight.<br>
 The relationship with coronary events weakens with lower levels of cholesterol.<br>
 However, statin side effects are common and are dose related. and include 
 fatigue, myopathy (skeletal muscle weakness), cerebral haemorrhage and acute renal failure.<br>
 A doctor may prescribe statins if a patient has 1. a total cholesterol
 level of 240 milligrams per decilitre, (mg / dL), (6.22 millimoles per litre, or mmol / L), or higher, or 2. a low density lipoprotein cholesterol,

 <a href="../images/16.14.0chd.gif">See diagram 16.14.0</a> Dioxins<br>
 1. The term "dioxins" generally refers to a series of chlorinated dioxins.<br> 
 The parent dioxin is dibenzo-p-dioxin, C12H8O2<br>
 The most widely studied compound, usually just called "dioxin", C12H4Cl4O2, (2,3,78-TCDD), "TCDD", IUPAC Name: 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, a by-product of manufacture of herbicide, "2,4,5-T", 2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxyacetic acid, (C8H5Cl3O3)<br>
 It was a compenent of the "Agent Orange" defoliant used in the Vietnam War, 1954-75.<br>
 Dioxins are chlorinated hydrocarbon compounds called dibenzo-p-dioxins.<br>
 The compounds have low water solubility, low vapour pressure many are very stable and tend to bioaccumulate, e.g. in human milk.<br>
 They are very toxic and persist in the environment for long periods.<br>
 They are produced during incineration of wastes and are a contaminant in chemical manufacturing processes.<br>
 They interfere with the action of hormones and the genetic system even in very small concentrations.<br>
 They accumulate in the fat cells, but are not metabolized.<br>
 They damage the immune system, leading to increased susceptibility to infectious disease.<br>
 When chemicals and plastics are manufactured or burned, dioxin may be produced as a by-product and dumped into landfill.<br>
 Landfill gas may include dioxins, which may spread into the community if landfill gas, mainly methane is burned as a source of energy.<br>
 An important source of dioxins is from burning polyvinyl chloride in incinerators.<br>
 Agent orange was widely thought to ruin the agricultural economy and be the cause of infant birth defects of children in Vietnam and in US military families during the Vietnam War, (1954-75).<br>
 The name "Agent Orange" came from the colour-coding orange stripe on the preparation package.<br>
 Dioxins also enter the environment from the manufacture of certain herbicides  and bleached paper.<br>
 2. There are also a number of dioxin-like PCBs, polybrominated biphenyls, (PBBs), and mixed chlorinated and brominated congeners with dioxin-like properties.<br>
 The molecule 1,2-dioxin, (C4H4O2), is very unstable.<br>
 Molecules called "dioxins" have a pair of benzene rings, two oxygen atoms and four chlorine atoms.<br>
 The chemical DDT is similar, so DDT and dioxins are toxic in small quantities, do not degrade, and both dissolve and accumulate in fat.<br>
 Both are still being detected in human milk.<br>
 Dioxins and DDT accumulate in the fat of animals and destroys their ability to reproduce.<br>

<a href="https://www.pfas.gov.au/about-pfas/substances"> PFAS</a>, Australian Government<br>
PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances,  is the broad name for 4,700 chemicals that do not break down, and instead accumulate in the soil, water, and human bodies.<br> 
1. (CNN) PFAS chemicals are known as “forever chemicals,” a family of potentially thousands of synthetic chemicals that are extremely persistent in the environment and in our bodies.<br>
 PFAS is short for perfluoroalky and polyfluoroalkyl substances and includes chemicals known as PFOS, PFOA and GenX.<br>
They are all identified by signature elemental bonds of fluorine and carbon, which are extremely strong and what make it so difficult for these chemicals to disintegrate in the environment or in our bodies.<br>
PFAS chemicals have been highly utilized in various industries, because of their ability to repel oil and water.<br>
They’ve been manufactured since the 1940s and can be found in Teflon nonstick products, stains and water repellants, paints, cleaning products, food packaging and firefighting foams.<br>
A growing body of science has found that there are potential adverse health impacts associated with PFAS exposure, including liver damage, thyroid disease, decreased fertility, high cholesterol, obesity, hormone suppression and cancer.<br>
These chemicals can easily migrate into the air, dust, food, soil and water.<br>
People can also be exposed to them through food packaging and industrial exposure.<br>
Emergency response teams hand out free bottled water to residents at the Parchment High School in Parchment, Mich., Friday, July 27, 2018.<br>
Authorities handed out thousands of free bottles of water Friday for two southwestern Michigan communities where the discovery of contamination from toxic industrial chemicals prompted a warning against using the public water system for drinking or cooking. (Daniel Vasta/Kalamazoo Gazette via AP)<br>
“I think that people should be concerned about the amount of PFOA and PFOS that is in our environment,” Susan M. Pinney, a professor in the Department of Environmental Health at the University of Cincinnati, US, wrote in an email.<br>
“These are chemicals with long half-lives,” meaning they persist in the environment as well as the body.<br>
They can also accumulate over time.<br>
In the body, they primarily settle into the blood, kidney and liver. A study from 2007 by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that PFAS chemicals could be detected in the blood of 98% of the US population.<br>
“Exposure in utero may have the greatest effect on developing children … and effects may last into adulthood,” Pinney said, adding that the science is still early.<br>
PFOS and PFOA are the two most-studied PFAS chemicals and have been identified as contaminants of emerging concern by the Environmental Protection Agency.<br>
2. (ABC) The Australian federal government has settled a class action over PFAS contamination from firefighting foam at seven sites across the country, 
but residents are calling the amount "atrocious".<br>
About 30,000 claimants will be paid $132.7m from the Commonwealth over historic contamination of regional towns.<br> 
The settlement follows a $212m PFAS payout for property value loss and distress in Katherine, Oakey, and Williamtown.<br>
PFAS is a broad name for 4,700 heat-resistant chemicals that were found to be toxic in groundwater near air force bases.<br> 
The Commonwealth Government of Australia will pay out $132.7 million to about 30,000 claimants.<br>
The claim alleged landowners at the sites were exposed to poisonous chemicals in firefighting foam used at military bases after it leached into groundwater.<br>
The sites are Wagga Wagga and Richmond in New South Wales, Wodonga in Victoria, Darwin in the Northern Territory, Townsville in Queensland, Edinburgh in South Australia, and Bullsbrook in Western Australia.<br>
Perfluoroalkyls are stable, synthetic chemicals which repel oil, grease, and water.<br>
They have been used in surface protection coatings for carpet, clothing, paper, cardboard packaging, and in fire-fighting foams.<br>
The largest amounts made in the US are perflurooctanoic acid, (PFOA), and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, (PFOS).

 PBDE, pentabromodiphenyl ether, (C12H5Br5O),  PBB, polybrominated biphenyls, 4,4'-dibromobiphenyl, (C12H8Br2)<br>
 PBDE consists of two benzene rings linked with an oxygen atom, instead of hydrogen, and up to 10 bromine atoms may be attached to the benzene rings.<br>
 For flame protection the congeners are 5 to 10 bromine atoms.<br>
 PBB consists of two directly linked benzene rings, and up to 10 bromine atoms.<br>
 PCB is a partly volatile liquid while the current flame retardants are  solid with very low volatility.<br>
 Both PBDE and PBB are additive substances, i.e. without chemical reaction  they are mixed with materials to be anti-inflammable.<br>
 Like the corresponding chlorinated substances, can develop dioxins and  furans (polybrominated dibenzodioxins and polybrominated  dibenzofurans) in case of incomplete combustion.<br>
 Some of the corresponding chlorinated substances have a very high toxicity  as well as being carcinogenic.<br>
 The toxic effects of brominated dioxins and furans are not known.<br>
 PBB has been detected in human milk.<br>
 Many PBDEs have been banned in many countries.<br>

 Perfluorooctanoic acid, (PFOA), (C8HF15O2), a surfactant, is used to make non-stick cookware, e.g. PTFE, ("Teflon"), and stain-resistant footwear and clothing.<br>
 It persists in the environment and is toxic to animals and may be a carcinogen.<br>
 Long-chain perfluorinated chemicals, LCPFCs, are very persistent in the environment and are found in the blood of the general U.S. population and in human milk.<br>
 PFOA is used to make fluoropolymers, e.g. polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE).<br>
 Teflon<sup>TM</sup> is not a specific chemical or product.<br>
 Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), is used in the process of making Teflon  and similar fluorotelomers, but it is burned off during the process and is not present in significant amounts in the final products, 
 e.g. non-stick cookware.<br>
 Some major manufacturers have agreed to eliminate the use of PFOA by 2015.<br>
 They are increasingly linked to cancer, liver and thyroid disease, immune  suppression and reduced fertility.<br>

 Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), man-made fluorosurfactant and global pollutant was the key ingredient in Scotchgard, a fabric protector and different stain repellents.<br>
 PFOS was added to Annex B of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants in May 2009, so it is banned under international environmental treaties.<br>
 In Australia, June 2016, residents of the town of Oakey have received assistance from an AUD 55 million dollar government assistance to fund blood testing and counselling, fearful of contamination 
 from PFOS and PFOA fire fighting chemicals used at the Oakey Army Aviation Base, southern Queensland. Residents are also asking for a government commitment to buying back contaminated land or adequate compensation.<br>
 These chemicals have also been found at Brisbane Airport and close to the Williamtown RAAF base, near Newcastle.<br>
 They are increasingly linked to cancer, liver and thyroid disease, immune suppression and reduced fertility.<br>
 Australian health protection drinking water guidelines of 0.5 micrograms per litre for PFOS and 5 micrograms per litre for PFOA are said to be above the 0.07 micrograms per litre adopted by the US.<br>
 In addition to industrial production, PFOS can form from the degradation of its precursors.<br>
 PFOS levels detected in wildlife are thought to be high enough to affect health parameters, and higher serum levels of PFOS are associated with increased risk of chronic kidney disease in the U.S.<br>
