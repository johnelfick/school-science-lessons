<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.56H"></a>3.56 Particulate matter and 
 dilution<br>
 Put one crystal of potassium permanganate in a test-tube.<br>
 Add 1 mL water.<br>
 Dissolve the crystal completely by shaking vigorously, keeping your thumb over the end of the test-tube.<br>
 Then add water to a total volume of 10 mL.<br>
 This is a "10 times dilution".<br>
 Pour this 10 mL of purple solution into a 100 mL beaker and then fill
the beaker with water.<br>
 This is now "100 times" dilution.<br>
 Fill the 10 mL test-tube with this solution and throw the rest away.<br>
 Dilute this again in the beaker to 100 mL.<br>
 It is now a"1, 000 times" dilution.<br>
 Note how often the solution can be diluted by a factor of 10 before the colour is so pale that it is only just visible.<br>
 The final dilution factor shows that if matter is particulate, the size
 of the particles must be small.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.58H"></a>3.58 Clay soil suspension<br>
 Shake a little clay soil with water in a test-tube.<br>
 Leave this to settle.<br>
 Note the humus layer at the tiny particles of rock and mineral at the bottom.<br>
 Filter the liquid.<br>
 Students will observe that the filtrate is still cloudy, this is because the clay particles have passed through the filter paper.<br>
 Do students understand why the suspension particles do not settle, even
 after a few days?<br>
 The size of colloidal particles is about between 1 and 100 mu.<br>
 Divide the filtrate into parts in test-tubes.<br>
 Keep one as a control.<br>
 To the other add a few drops of barium chloride solution, or some aluminium
 salt solution.<br>
 Note what happens in half an hour and in one hour.<br>
 The same effect occurs when a clay suspension in a river meets the salts
 contained in sea water.<br>
 In many hot countries salt is crystallized from pans built on the clay
beds near the mouths of rivers.<br>

 See: <a href="Commercial.html#AnemometersH">Anemometers</a>, wind energy, (Commercial)<br>
 The sources of renewable energy:<br>
1. Bagasse gas<br>
 Waste plant materials, the residual fibrous waste from raw cane sugar
processing can be burned to generate electricity.<br>
2. Biomass energy<br>
 Landfill gas, mainly methane gas, (CH4), produced by decomposing
 organic matter, is captured and burned to produce electricity.<br>
 This method also prevents methane, and other landfill gases, from becoming
 a potential greenhouse gas in the atmosphere.<br>
3. Hydroelectric energy<br>
 Falling water to drives turbines to generate electricity.<br>
4. Solar energy<br>
 Solar energy converts energy from sunlight to electricity, an average of 1366 watts per square metre per hour.<br>
5. Wind energy<br>
 Wind drives turbines to generate electricity<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.1.01H"></a>9.1.01 Energy, potential energy, 
 kinetic energy, Gravesande's experiment<br>
 Potential energy, PE or E<sub>P</sub>, is energy deriving from position.<br>
 A stretched spring has elastic potential energy, PE = kx<sup>2</sup> /
2.<br>
 An object raised to a height above the Earth's surface has gravitational
 potential energy, PE = mgh.<br>
 Other sorts of potential energy include electrical, nuclear and chemical
 potential energy.<br>
 Kinetic energy, K E, is the energy of moving objects, K E = mv<sup>2</sup>
 / 2.<br>
 The experiment to show that E<sub>k</sub> = 1/2 mv<sup>2</sup> was first done by Willem Jacob Gravesande, 1688-1742, Netherlands, who dropped brass balls with different velocities into soft clay.<br>
 Conservation of energy.<br>
 Energy can be converted from one form to another, but the total quantity
 stays the same.<br>
 Transfer of energy<br>
 GPE (Gravitational Potential Energy) and KE (Kinetic Energy)<br>
 Conservation of energy: KE <sub>translational</sub> (1/2 mv<sup>2</sup>) 
 = GPE (mgh)<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.1.1H"></a>9.1.1 Rattle tin of stones<br>
 To imitate the heat movement of gas particles and know the energy of it, 
put some small stones in a tin with a lid.<br>
 Replace the lid and shake the tin.<br>
 You can feel and hear the stones rattling inside the tin.<br>
 The stones are knocking against the walls of the tin.<br>
 If you shake much harder, the stones can knock the lid off the tin and
burst out.<br>
 The movement of gas particles in a closed container is similar to the
movement of the stones.<br>
 If you heat the gas particles they move faster and can burst the closed
 container.<br>
 Heating a liquid or a gas in a closed container is very dangerous.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.1.2H"></a>9.1.2 Heat lumps of wax containing 
 lead shot<br>
 To imitate differences of movements of solid, liquid and gas particles, 
 push very small lead shot into wax or petroleum jelly.<br>
 The lead shot is like the particles of a solid that cannot move about.<br>
 Put the mixture into a container and melt the wax at the bottom of the
container.<br>
 Heat the container.<br>
 The wax melts and the lead shot can move around each other limited.<br>
 The lead shot is like the particles of a liquid.<br>
 If you burn away the wax and shake the container that lead shot can move
 in straight lines at random.<br>
 The lead shot is now like the particles of a gas.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.1.3H"></a>9.1.3 Aluminium powder twinkles<br>
 To observe the relation between the twinkle of aluminium powder and its
 size, add aluminium powder to a beaker of tap water with a 
 few drops of detergent.<br>
 Stir the mixture.<br>
 Make the room dark and shine a strong light through the liquid.<br>
 Observe that the smallest suspended particles twinkle like stars, but the
 larger particles do not twinkle.<br>
 The reason is that the water molecules hit the smallest aluminium particles
 and turn them over so that they reflect flashes of light and 
 cause the twinkling.<br>
 Water molecules cannot turn over the larger particles, so they do not
twinkle.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.1.4H"></a>9.1.4 Hot and cold water drops<br>
 Use a pin to make identical holes in the bottoms of identical paper cups.<br>
 Mount the cups over drinking glasses.<br>
 Fill one paper cup with hot water and the other with cold water.<br>
 Observe the drops of water dripping from the paper cups.<br>
 The hot water leaks faster than the cold water, because the particles have more kinetic energy and so it is easier to overcome the forces of adhesion around the holes in the bottoms of the paper cups.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.1.7H"></a>9.1.7 Molecular dimensions, size of a molecule<br>
 Use oil molecules. because oil has a density less than water.<br>
 The oil will float on the surface and not dissolve in the water.<br>
 If the water has a large enough surface area, that thin oil will spread out in a layer one molecule thick, a monomolecular layer and not form little "hills" of molecules.<br>
 If the volume of oil and the surface area that it forms is known, calculate the thickness of a monomolecular layer by dividing the volume by the area.<br>
 Use a water container &gt; 30 cm<sup>2</sup> so as not to restrict the
oil film.<br>
 Sprinkle the surface of the water with a very fine light powder such as
 talc powder.<br>
 When the oil is put on the water, it will push the powder away and the
area covered by the oil will be seen clearly.<br>
 To find the volume of oil, pour thin oil into a burette.<br>
 Use a thin petroleum distillate.<br>
 Find the volume of fifty drops by running oil from the burette drop by
drop and counting the drops.<br>
 Allow one more drop to fall on a piece of plastic.<br>
 Touch the oil drop with the point of a glass rod and then touch the prepared
 water surface.<br>
 The oil spreads out.<br>
 Make an approximate measurement of the area over which it spreads.<br>
Estimate what fraction of oil was removed by the glass point by using the glass point to remove successive fractions from the drop until it has all been used.<br>
 Calculate the volume of oil put on the water and estimate made of the
thickness of the oil layer, about 10<sup>-6 </sup>mm.<br>
 This is an approximate dimension of a single molecule of the oil.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.2.01H"></a>9.2.0.1 Conservation of energy,  work, energy, kinetic energy and potential energy<br>
<a href="./images/9.2.0.gif">See diagram 9.2.0</a>: Work at angle θ to the direction of the force<br>
Energy conversion, convert potential energy to kinetic energy, potential energy and gravity, transfer energy, conservation of mechanical energy in a closed system, problems involving the conversion of mechanical energy GPE &lt;--&gt; KE, EPE &lt;--&gt; KE, gravitational potential energy in 
 its general, non-uniform form, GPE = mgh, GPE = (- G m<sub>1</sub> m<sub>2</sub> / d) and its application to escape velocity.<br>
 When an object is moved by a force, F, through a distance in the direction
 of the force, s, the work done is F × s.<br>
 The unit of work is the joule, newton metre.<br>
 Work = Fs<br>
 However, if the direction of displacement of the object is at angle to
the direction of the force Work = Fscos<br>
 When work is done on an object the energy of the object changes as stored
 energy, potential energy and / or as change in speed, 
 kinetic energy.<br>
 Unit energy is expended when unit work is done.<br>
 The unit of energy is the joule, newton.metre.<br>
 (James Joule, 1818-1889, England)<br>
The joule is the SI unit of energy and work, equal to the work done by a force of one newton, when its point of application moves one metre in the direction of the force.<br>
 Work done = change in energy so energy is the capacity for doing work.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.2.22H"></a>9.2.22 Kinetic energy<br>
 Kinetic energy, K.E., energy due to velocity = 1/2 mv<sup>2</sup>.<br>
 So kinetic energy can be measured by the work an object could do in coming
 to rest.<br>
 If an object moving with velocity u has its velocity increased to velocity v by application of an uniform force F, then the work done is equal to the change in energy.<br>
 Work = 1/2 mv<sup>2</sup> -1/2 mu<sup>2</sup><br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.2.0bH"></a>9.2.0b Potential energy<br>
 Potential energy, P.E. = change in position or change in state, energy
due to position or strain.<br>
If an object weight mg newton is raised through a vertical height, h, there is an increase in gravitational potential energy.<br>
 Potential energy, P.E. = mgh<br>
 Change in potential energy may result in a change of state.<br>
 Steam at 100<sup>o</sup>C has greater potential energy that water at 100<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 A spring under tension in a jack-in-a-box has the more potential energy
 than a slack spring.<br>
 A large molecule, e.g. glucose, has more potential energy than the component
 molecules.<br>
 Coal is an example of a store of chemical potential energy.<br>
 The sum of kinetic energy and potential energy of a body falling freely
 under gravity is a constant throughout its path.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.2.23H"></a>9.2.23 Braking distance and  stopping distance, tyres<br>
See: <a href="Commercial3.html#TimeH">Stopwatch</a> (Commercial)<br>
 The "braking distance" of a moving vehicle involves the work that must be done to bring the vehicles to rest, W = Fs, i.e. how much force must be applied to stop the vehicle in a certain distance.<br>
 So it refers to the distance a vehicle travels from the time when the
brakes are applied to the time when the vehicle stops.<br>
Braking distance is affected by the speed of the vehicle, the coefficient of friction between tires and road surface, the rolling resistance of the tires, and the air drag on the vehicle.<br>
 The "total stopping distance" includes braking distance and also the reaction
 distance = speed × driver reaction time, e.g. 1.5 seconds.<br>
Stopping distances can be affected by, experience and age, average deceleration of the vehicle, vehicle condition and braking capacity of the vehicle, condition of the tyres, weather conditions, road surface, weight of the vehicle.<br>
During a tyre change pit stop for racing cars, the tyres are heated by the changers, because tyres don't "work" until they reach their designed optimal temperature range.<br>
 The rubber and other compounds are selected to perform within a specific
temperature range.<br>
 If the tyres are too cold, there is less grip causing spins or having to
travel slower on corners.<br>
 Travelling slower is a problem for grip as the car aerodynamics are such
that they can only effectively corner at higher speed, pressed 
onto the road.<br>
Drivers are more confidant taking a corner at speed than slowly, because 
 the grip is so much greater if the tyres are sufficiently hot.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.2.24H"></a>9.2.24 Flywheels<br>
 A flywheel is a heavy-rimmed wheel attached to a revolving shaft to store
 momentum and usually to regulate the movement of 
 machinery.<br>
 A flywheel stores energy by accelerating a cylindrical assembly, a rotor
 or flywheel, to a high speed and maintaining the energy as 
 rotational energy.<br>
 The energy is released by slowing down the flywheel.<br>
 The flywheel is like a mechanical battery that spins to store energy that
 is instantly available when needed.<br>
 When absorbing energy, the flywheel's motor acts like a load and draws
power from the grid to accelerate the rotor to a higher speed.<br>
When discharging, the motor is switched into generator mode, and the inertial energy of the rotor drives the generator, which, in turn, create electricity that is then injected back into the grid.<br>
 Performance is measured in energy units - kilowatt-hours (kWh) or megawatt-hours
 (MWh), to show how much power is available for 
 a given period of time.<br>
 At 16, 000 rpm a flywheel can store and deliver 25 kWh of extractable energy.<br>
Flywheel-based energy storage systems, unlike fossil-fuel power plants that are used on the grid for frequency regulation, are sustainable "green" technology solutions that consume no fossil fuel, nor produce carbon dioxide or other emissions during operation.<br>
Flywheels can operate reliably for many years with little or no maintenance.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.2.1H"></a>9.2.1 Children's swing<br>
 1. Ride on a child's swing.<br>
 Note the original height of the swing above the ground.<br>
 Let yourself swing to the other side.<br>
 The height reached on the other side is almost the original height.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">2. Swing a pendulum.<br>
See: <a href="Commercial3.html#TimeH">Pendulum</a> (Commercial)<br>
 Note the original height of the bob.<br>
 Let the bob make a full swing.<br>
 The height it reaches is almost the original height.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">3. To study the transfer and conservation of mechanical 
 energy, observe a child on a swing.<br>
 The heights raised at the two sides are always the same.<br>
 It shows that the potential energies of the swing at the two peaks are
equal.<br>
 If you sit on the swing, you may experience the short rest feeling while
 reaching the peak, then the velocity will become faster and faster.<br>
 At the top point the swing and person only possess potential energy, but
 no kinetic energy.<br>
 At the bottom point their kinetic energy reaches the maximum, but the
potential energy becomes the minimum.<br>
 When the swing reaches the other peak, the kinetic energy completely changes
 into the potential energy again.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.2.1.1H"></a>9.2.1.1 Rebounding balls<br>
 To observe the transfer and loss of mechanical energy, hold a ball with
 a strong elasticity, record its height, then let the ball falls freely 
 from rest.<br>
 Record the heights the ball rebounds several times after the ball falls
 on the cement floor and find the relationship among the heights.<br>
 Use balls with different bounce characteristics, e.g. tennis ball, baseball, 
 squash ball, cricket ball, golf ball, steel ball bearing, plasticine 
 ball, silly putty ball.<br>
 Do the experiment again on a sandlot, instead of the cement floor.<br>
 Observe the change in shape of the sand as well as the rebounding heights.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.2.1.2H"></a>9.2.1.2 Rolling down an U-shaped 
 track<br>
 When a ball or wheeled object rolls down an U-shaped track it will roll
 up to the same height as it was released.<br>
 If it rolls down onto a flat track, then meets the second half of the
U, it will almost roll up to the same height as it was released.<br>
 An object rolling down from the top of a hill will have enough energy
when it gets to the bottom of the hill to then roll up the next hill to 
 the same height, with some corrections for friction.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.2.2H"></a>9.2.2 Drop a golf ball inside 
 a car tyre<br>
<a href="./images/9.2.2.gif">See diagram 9.2.2</a>: Ball inside car tyre<br>
 1. Hold the ball inside the tyre and note the original height above the
 ground.<br>
 Let the ball go.<br>
 It runs down inside the tyre and up the other side.<br>
 The height it reaches in the other side is almost the original height
but never more.<br>
 Repeat the experiment using different original heights.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">2. Let an outer tyre stand upright on the ground 
 and fix it well.<br>
 Hold a golf ball with your hand above the tyre and loosen your hand at
a certain height and let the ball roll in the groove inside a tyre.<br>
 The ball rolls from the original height to the bottom of the tyre, then
 rolls upwards reaching the original height, but not more than the 
 original height.<br>
 Repeat the experiment by dropping the ball at different heights.<br>
 The small ball will keep its energy changeless at the whole process of
moving if neglect the energy loss due to friction and other reasons.<br>
When the small rolls down from the top point to the bottom of the tyre, its gravitational potential energy changes into the kinetic energy.<br>
When it rolls up from the bottom point to the top, its kinetic energy changes into the gravitational potential energy again so it comes back to the original height.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.2.3H"></a>9.2.3 Roll-back jar, come back
can, elastic potential energy and kinetic energy<br>
<a href="./images/9.2.3.gif">See diagram 9.2.3</a>: Roll-back jar<br>
 1. Use a 10 cm plastic jam jar with a screw-on plastic lid.<br>
 Drill two small holes, each 2 cm from the centre, along the diameter of
 the bottom of the jar.<br>
 The distance between the two holes is 4 cm.<br>
 Drill the same two holes in the cap of the jar.<br>
 Push an elastic band through each of the two holes in the bottom of the
 jar.<br>
 Tie the two rubber bands together outside the bottom of the jar.<br>
 Pull the ends of the two elastic bands into the jar to cross over then
push the two ends through the two holes in the cap.<br>
 Attach a 50 g weight to one end of a thin wire.<br>
 Tie the other end of the wire to the rubber bands together where they
cross over.<br>
 Pull on the rubber bands that passed through the cap and tie them so that 
the weight does not touch the sides of the jar when the jar is 
 horizontal on its side.<br>
 Hold the jar horizontally and turn it over many times so that the thin
wire becomes shorter and shorter.<br>
 When you hold the jar horizontally and turn it you store potential energy
 as the thin wire became shorter and the weight became higher.<br>
 Also, the elastic potential energy is stored in the elastic bands when

 When you roll the biscuit tin forward, the heavy nut remains hanging down

 The inner diameter of the washer is just larger than the diameter of the 
round stick.<br>
 Hold the dowel vertically and attach the bottom end to a table.<br>

 The spinning washer at the top of the dowel has rotational kinetic energy
 and gravitational potential energy due to its height.<br>
 As the spinning washer falls some of the gravitational potential energy
 is converted to rotational potential energy so it spins faster.<br>
 However, some of its gravitational energy is lost to friction with the

 Longitudinal waves produce compress and stretch in the medium.<br>
 With the propagation of the form of movement, the energy of the wave propagates.
<br>
 The form of movement is the same to the velocity of energy of propagation
 under the condition of no chromatic dispersion.<br>
 It can reach thousands of metres in a second, far surpassing the value
of general moving body.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Experiments<br>
 1. Arrange several same coins in a line on the table.<br>
 You can fix them with adhesive tape.<br>
 Place one coins in front of the line and place another coin at the end
of the line.<br>
 The last coin touches the one in front of it, but is not connected.<br>
 Shoot the first coin quickly to make it strike the second.<br>
 Then observe the movement of all the coins.<br>
 When the first coin hits one end of the line of coins the last coin moves
 back very rapidly.<br>
 The energy produced by the first coin transmits rapidly along the line
of coins.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">2. Use a set of dominoes, or some similar small 
 squares of wood, e.g. mah-jong pieces, on their edges in a long row.<br>
 Place them face to face.<br>
 The distance between two dominoes should be shorter than height of them.
<br>
 Push the first one A rapidly.<br>
 Observe the movement of all the dominoes.<br>
 As shock dominoes A, it is propagated a small pulse of energy to cause
it topples.<br>
 It knocks against the following domino, which knocks the third and so
on until finally the end domino falls.<br>
 It can be seen if you observe that although every domino falls just at its original place and the distance of its motion is very small, the propagation of this pules energy is so quick that B has begun to fall down before A falls down completely.<br>
 During propagation of compressive energy, the behaviour of solid particles
 is like that of the dominoes.<br>
 Solids consist of atoms, ions and molecules arranged in a row closely
 together.<br>
 When one end of a solid obtains the compressive energy due to impact, 
 the particles there produce compressive deformation and the 
 compressive energy is transformed to neighbour particles, and so on.<br>
 The process of above happens among particles in turn that reaches the
other end in a short time and from the particles here propagates 
 the compressive energy to the outside, finally cause the last coin in experiment A shoots forward.<br>
 In the process above, although every particle's motion is very weak, they
 are much like that connected with small springs going on 
 forward with energy in a form of waves.<br>
 It has been shown from the dominoes experiment above and analysis about
 the motion of particles inside the solid that the speed of 
 propagation surpasses far from that of each object when they are connected.<br>
 Sometimes you can see the similar phenomenon to the dominoes in daily
life.<br>

 can notice the situation of marshalling.<br>
 As one carriage is connected with the whole train, it collides the last
 carriage of the train.<br>
 With a series of reactions that every carriage moves slightly in turn, 
such energy in a form of shock waves propagates throughout the 
 train rapidly that makes you feel as though the whole train begins to
move almost instantaneously.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">4. When traffic jam happens in a highway the cars 
 run in a row.<br>
 At this time if the last car cannot stop in time to collide the back of

<a href="./images/9.2.9.gif">See diagram 9.2.9</a>: Waves propagate energy<br>
 Waves propagate not only the vibration state of the source, but also the
 energy of it.<br>
 Prepare a water vessel, pour water into it and put a cork by the vessel.<br>
 Hold a long, narrow wooden rod and make it move up and down in another
end of the vessel.<br>
 Observe the motion of water wave and notice the motion of cork.<br>
 Increase or decrease the motion and observe what happens about water wave
 and cork.<br>
 Increase or decrease the frequency of the motion and observe the situation
 again.<br>
 The vibration of a wooden rod caused by hand makes it become a vibration
 source.<br>
 The state of its motion and energy propagate out by means of water.<br>
 Thus forms the water waves.<br>
 So you can see the wave crest and trough in water.<br>
 The energy carried by water wave is propagated to the cork causing it
vibrate up and down.<br>
 The cork is up as crest comes, down when a trough comes.<br>
 The energy of rod vibration propagates to the cork through the medium
role of water waves.<br>
 So the wave propagates not only the state of a vibration source, but also
 the energy of it.<br>
 Increasing the extent of a shake by hand is increasing the vibration energy
 of source and water wave increases with it.<br>
 All this shows that the more the energy the source has, the more energy
 it propagates and vice versa.<br>
 If you increase the frequency of a shake by hand, the wave shape varies
 with it and the distance between the wave crest or that of 
 crest and trough decreases.<br>
 The vibration frequency of the cork increases too.<br>
 Waves are the propagators of energy that carried the energy produced by
 source to all places it arrives.<br>

 1. You do not need a pump to circulate the water to the plastic bottle
storage tank.<br>
 Water in the blackened collector tube absorbs the sun's energy and gets
 hotter.<br>
 This hot water is less dense than the rest of the water so it rises out
 of the collector into the storage tank.<br>
 The cold water at the bottom of the bottle then flows into the bottom
of the collector and the cycle begins again.<br>
 This process is called thermo-syphoning.<br>
You need water based black plastic paint, -10<sup>o</sup>C to 110<sup>o</sup>C thermometer, adhesive tape, roof and gutter type silicon sealer or "Blue Tack", plastic bottle with lid for the water storage tank, dry cleaning wrap or "Glad Wrap" plastic film, plastic funnel, roll of aluminium foil, tie wire.<br>

 2.4 Record water temperatures every 5 minutes for 1 hour.<br>
 2.5 Calculate the amount of heat energy gained by the water in your heater

 Heat (Joule) = m × c × DT, where m = mass of water = (volume in cm<sup>3</sup>

 DT = temperature increase (final temperature - initial temperature).<br>
 How could you make improvements to increase the efficiency of your solar
 heater?<br>
 Calculate the efficiency of the solar collector:<br>
 Percentage Efficiency = (Energy input / Energy output) × (100 / 1).<br>
 Energy input from the sun falling on 1 m<sup>2</sup> = 800 × number of
seconds collector exposed to sun, J per m<sup>2</sup>.<br>
 Energy input after 1 hour in the sun = (800 × 60 × 60 J per m<sup>2</sup>)
 = (2, 880, 000 J per m<sup>2</sup>) = (288 MJ per m<sup>2</sup>).<br>
 Adjust this figure for the surface area of your collector.<br>

 However, some energy will be lost during the swing by drag, air resistance

 Finally raise the piston up then the water streams out of the top of the 
syringe.<br>

 Downstroke:<br>
 Valve A is closed, valve B is forced open, air passes out of the chamber
 into the outlet pipe<br>
 Upstroke:<br>
 Valve A is open, valve B is closed,.<br>
 The pressure in the chamber is reduced and water rises in the inlet pipe
 caused by atmospheric pressure on the water surface.<br>
 Downstroke:<br>
 Valve A is closed, water is forced through valve B into outlet pipe<br>
 Upstroke:<br>
 Water in outlet pipe closes valve B.<br>
 More water enters the chamber through valve A.<br>
 The air chamber causes the flow of water to continue during the upstroke.
<br>
 On the downstroke, water enters the air chamber compressing the air inside
 it.<br>
 On the upstroke, the air expands again to force some air up the outlet
pipe.<br>
 The atmosphere can support a column of mercury 76 cm vertical height, 
 so h in the diagram can be no more than 76 × 13.6 (relative 
 density of density of mercury) = 1, 030 cm.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a href="./images/4.234x.gif">See diagram 4.234</a>: Test-tube force pump<br>
 1. Use a small and a large test-tube.<br>
 Heat the bottom of each test-tube with an alcohol burner.<br>
 When the bottoms are soft, but not melting, punch a hole with a metal awl.<br>
 Fit a ball bearing or small marble in each test-tube to act as a valve.<br>
 Fit a cork with a bent glass tube at the end of the small tube.<br>
 Put the small test-tube into the large tube.<br>
 Wrap string around the inner test-tube so that it fits tightly in the
outer one, but can still slide up and down and secure the inner tube to 
 act as a piston of a force pump.<br>
 Put the end of the large tube into water in a beaker.<br>
 Raise the piston then water is sucked up the large tube through the ball
 valve of the large tube.<br>
 Push down the piston then the water raises the small tube through the
ball valve of the small tube.<br>
 Raise the piston then the water streams out of the small tube.<br>
 Raise and push the piston continually then water streams out of the bent
 tube continually.<br>
 2. Use a thinner test-tube and a thicker test-tube.<br>
 Heat the bottom of each of test-tube with a burner then punch a hole with
 a nail when the glass in the bottom is soft, but not melting.<br>
 When the test-tubes are cool, fit a ball bearing or marble to sit in the 
holes in the bottom to act as valves.<br>
 Fit a cork with a bent glass tube passing through it into the end of the 
thinner test-tube.<br>
 Wrap string around the thinner test-tube so that it fits tightly in the
 thicker test-tube, but can still slide up and down.<br>
 Put the thinner test-tube into the thicker test-tube.<br>
 The thinner test-tube can act as a piston of a force pump.<br>
 Put the end of the thicker test-tube into water.<br>
 Raise the piston.<br>
 During the upstroke water moves up through the ball valve of the thicker
 test-tube, because of reduced atmospheric pressure.<br>
 Lower the piston.<br>
 During the downstroke water moves up through the ball valve in the thinner
 piston while the ball valve in the thicker piston remains closed.<br>
 Continue to raise and lower the piston until water streams out of the
bent tube.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.4.6H"></a>9.4.6 Flask fountain<br>
 Boil some water in a flask and insert a one hole stopper with a single
tube then invert the apparatus with the lower end of the tube 
 under water in a beaker.<br>
 At first water moves slowly up the tube, but as water touches the inside
 of the flask cooling quickens and water moves more quickly 
 up the tube.<br>
 Make the colour of the water change by putting dilute hydrochloric acid
 in the in the flask and bromothymol blue in the beaker.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.4.7H"></a>9.4.7 Escape from submerged car<br>
 1. The advice from emergency authorities nowadays is that as soon as a 
car hits the water and starts to sink, immediately undo the 
 seat belts, wind down the windows and exit through the opened windows.<br>
 The front side windows may be larger than the hind windows.<br>
 Do not waste time by calling 999 first.<br>
 If children are in the back of the car, get the largest child out first, 
 then the smaller child or children, then yourself.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">2. If the car submerges before you can get out, 
 the door of a submerged car cannot be opened until the interior is flooded, because the 
 pressure differential between outside and inside is too great for a trapped person to force open the door.<br>
 The inside and outside pressures must be equalized, so the interior must
 be flooded first.<br>
 So a trapped person should try to remain calm and not attempt to open
the door until the interior is almost flooded.<br>
 A trapped person can open a window in a submerged car only by using a
window breaking hammer, which has a pointed tip to 
 shatter tempered glass.<br>
 These hammers are cheap, costing only about $10.<br>

 See: <a href="Commercial3.html#SolarH">Solar</a>, (Commercial)<br>
A crystalline silicon cell used in solar panels for solar power has an
efficiency of about 22% for the conversion of light to electricity 
 (16% for the cheaper cells in household solar panels).<br>
 A concentrated solar power system (CSP) use lenses or mirrors to concentrate
 solar thermal energy, onto a small area to heat water 
 in a steam turbine and generate electricity.<br>
 A concentrated photovoltaic system (CPV) focus sunlight onto photovoltaic 
 materials to generate electricity directly.<br>

 pixel in flat screen televisions, touch screens, solar cells)<br>
 Pyrite, FeS2, iron (II) disulfide, can be used in solar cells instead of silica.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Experiments<br>
 1. Measure current produced when the collector is perpendicular to rays
 during the day, noting the angle of incidence of sunlight.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">2. Measuring the effect of the angle of incidence 
 on the flow rate (i.e. power output) of a electrical water pump powered 
by 
 photoelectric cells.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">3. Use layers of shade cloth to measure the effect 
 of shade on the output of a solar panel.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">4. Use coloured cellophane to measure the effect of light of different wavelengths and to note whether solar cells are sensitive to all wavelengths.<br>
Note that not all different coloured cellophane sheets have the same percentage transmission!<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">5. Dust on a solar panel<br>
<a href="./images/39.1.0.gif">See diagram 39.1.0</a>: Power from solar panels<br>
 Use bentonite clay powder, fine sand, or icing sugar to measure the effect
 of dust on the output of a solar panel.<br>
 Use and incandescent bulb as the constant light source.<br>
 Adjust the solar panel so it is working at maximum power.<br>
 In the circuit use variable resistance from 0 ohm to 300 ohm to plot a
graph to find the maximum power before adding the "dust".<br>
 Then Efficiency = P dust/ Pno dust x 100%.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">6. An array of solar panels produce 17 to 19 kW 
 on cloudy to cloud free days or average heat to hot days.<br>
 The sunlight falling on the panel changes usually peaks at noon, and as
 the temperature of the panel rises its efficiency changes.<br>
 Most panels produce maximum power at 25<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 Measure the V and I across a resistor, e.g. 56 Ω, connected to a solar
panel.<br>
 Repeat the experiment with constant illumination and with the solar panel
 over a hotplate.<br>
 Keep the temperature constant and vary the illumination with and electric bar heater in front of the solar panel.<br>
