 1. In many cases a virus is a molecule of DNA or RNA within a protein coat and sometimes a membrane.<br>
The nucleic acid in the virus contains instructions for the cell to make new viruses.<br>
A virus is a submicroscopic infectious agent that replication inside a cell by using the cell's own biochemical processes.
 Viruses cause infected cells to produce progeny viruses.<br>
 Retroviruses use the enzyme reverse transcriptase to copy the viral RNA (ribonucleic acid) into DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid).<br>
 Plant viruses can usually be recognized by marks on leaves, e.g. mosaics, leaf streaks, and ring spots.<br>
 Viruses are not affected by antibiotics.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.213.01H"></a>9.213.01 Bacteriophage<br>
<a href="9.3.70.GIF">See diagram 9.3.70</a>: T4 bacteriophage that attacks E. coli.<br>
 A bacteriophage or "phage" is a very small virus that infects bacteria.<br>
 The T4 bacteriophage infects the bacterium Escherichia coli, E.coli, found in the human gut.<br>
 This infection is used to study viruses and how they infect and replicate inside cells.<br>
 T-phages have head, capsid, containing double-stranded DNA genetic material.<br>
 The tail of the bacteriophage includes the tail, sheath, base plate and tail fibres, made of different proteins, used to attach itself to the bacterium.<br>
 The phage then inserts its own genetic material inside of the host bacterial cell so that it replicates and make more bacteriophages.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.213.1H"></a>9.213.1 HSV-1 (Herpes simplex 1)<br>
 HSV-1, herpes simplex virus causes cold sores, painful blemishes of the mouth (fever blisters).<br>
 It can become dormant for years, when drugs cannot affect it<br>
Years later, it can be revived by excessive sunlight or fever to cause a cold sore in the same place as before.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.213.2H"></a>9.213.2 HSV-2 (Herpes simplex 2)<br>
 HSV-2 causes painful genital sores that can return late in life as shingles.<br>
 The Herpes varicella-zoster virus causes chicken pox (varicella) in the skin of children as red spots that become small bubbles then become dry crusts.<br>
 In adults, the Herpes varicella-zoster virus causes shingles (zoster) as painful lesions in a pattern along the sensory nerves.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.213.3H"></a>9.213.3 Transduce a cell.<br>
 In microbiology (not physics), to transduce a cell is to transfer genetic material from another cell to that cell, another usually by a virus particle or a virus.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="ToBRFVH"></a>ToBRFV, New tomato virus, 19/02/2020<br>
Tobamoviruses include Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) and Tomato Mosaic Virus (ToMV).<br>
ToBRFV can overcome all known genetic resistance in tomato, including the Tm-22 gene.<br>
It can cause severe fruit symptoms on otherwise resistant tomato varieties.<br>
Pepper is another primary host for ToBRFV.<br>
The L genes for resistance to TMV and PMMoV (Pepper mild mottle virus) in pepper currently seem to hold up to ToBRFV.<br>
Peppers without the resistance gene(s) are highly susceptible to the virus.<br>
Transfer of the virus from infected to healthy plants commonly occurs via mechanical means, e.g. touching and manipulation of infected plants.<br>
ToBRFV is similar to other tobamoviruses in that the virus particles are long, symmetrical rods, so it cannot be distinguished by observation by electron microscopy.<br>
Tomato F1 cultivars that are highly resistant (HR) to ToMV and TMV can be severely affected by this new virus. ToBRFV.<br>
The known resistance genes do not protect against ToBRFV, and only preventative crop management and sanitation practices will produce a useful crop.<br>
Some tomato varieties can develop a high virus level without physically expressing symptoms, so infected plants of these varieties can then become a source for spread of ToBRFV infection to healthy tomato plants or susceptible pepper plants.<br>
Seed companies are working on identifying and introducing resistance to the virus in new varieties, but it could take several years, until new resistant varieties are introduced.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.215H"></a>9.215 Zika virus<br>
 The Zika virus is on the move and new measures are needed to help to slow it down.<br>
 It is a distressing and disturbing infection that may be linked to thousands of babies being born with microcephaly.<br>
 It is spreading through the Americas.<br>
 Threats from the same virus family are increasing.<br>
 Zika belongs to the same Flaviviridae family as the Dengue and Chikungunya viruses, and all are transmitted by the Aedes Aegypti mosquito.<br>
 Currently, there is no effective treatment or vaccine against the Zika virus<br>
 The best way to protect yourself is to avoid being bitten by mosquitos.<br>
 The Brazilian Ministry of Health will distribute 500, 000 tests to perform Zika virus diagnostics.<br>
 As a result, public laboratories will expand 20 times to assist with this extra surveillance.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.2.12H"></a>9.2.12 Coronavirus<br>
Coronaviruses are a big group of viruses that cause illnesses such as the common cold or more recent diseases including SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS.<br>
COVID-19, (Corona Virus Disease 19), is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans.<br>
The viruses are named for the corona, or crown, of surface proteins that the virus uses to penetrate the cells of its host.<br>
Coronavirus disease 2019<br>
(COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, (SARS-CoV-2).<br>
The disease had spread globally by 13/03/2020, since 2019, resulting in the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic.<br>
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.<br>
Muscle pain, sputum production and sore throat are some of the less common symptoms.<br>
While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to pneumonia and multi-organ failure.<br>
The case fatality rate is estimated at between 1% and 5%, but varies by age and other health conditions.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.2.13H"></a>9.2.13 Kill Coronavirus by washing your hands with soap.<br>
Based on article by Palli Thordarson, Professor of Chemistry, University of New South Wales.<br>
Viruses can be active outside the body for hours, even days.<br>
Disinfectants, liquids, wipes, gels and creams containing alcohol are all useful at getting rid of them, but they are not quite as good as normal soap.<br>
Health authorities have been giving us two messages:<br>
1. When you have the virus there are no drugs that can kill it or help you get rid of it.<br>
2. Wash your hands to stop the virus spreading.<br>
Why does soap work so well on the Coronavirus, and indeed most viruses?<br>
Because the virus is a self-assembled nanoparticle in which the weakest link is the lipid (fatty) bilayer.<br>
Soap dissolves the fat membrane and the virus falls apart and dies, or rather, we should say it becomes inactive as viruses aren’t really alive.<br>
Most viruses consist of three key building blocks: ribonucleic acid (RNA), proteins and lipids.<br>
A virus-infected cell makes lots of these building blocks, which then spontaneously self-assemble to form the virus.<br>
There are no strong covalent bonds holding these units together, so you do not necessarily need harsh chemicals to split those units apart.<br>
When an infected cell dies, all these new viruses escape and go on to infect other cells.<br>
Some end up also in the airways of lungs.<br>
When you cough, or especially when you sneeze, tiny droplets from the airways can fly up to 10 metres.<br>
The droplets are thought to be the main Coronavirus carriers and they can go at least two metres.<br>
These tiny droplets end on surfaces and often dry out quickly, but the viruses remain active.<br>
Human skin is an ideal surface for a virus, because it is “organic” and the proteins and fatty acids in the dead cells on the surface interact with the virus.<br>
When you touch, say, a steel surface with a virus particle on it, it will stick to your skin and hence get transferred on to your hands.<br>
If you then touch your face, especially your eyes, nostrils or mouth, you can get infected, and most people touch their face once every two to five minutes.<br>
Washing the virus off with water alone might work, but water is not good at competing with the strong, glue-like interactions between the skin and the virus.<br>
Soapy water is different, because it contains fat-like substances, amphiphiles, some of which are structurally similar to the lipids in the virus membrane.<br>
An amphiphile chemical compound, (Greek <i>amphis, philia</i> both love), has both hydrophilic (water-loving) and lipophilic (fat-loving) properties, and is 
called an amphiphilic compound.<br>
The soap molecules “compete” with the lipids in the virus membrane, which is similar to how soap also removes normal dirt from the skin.<br>
The soap not only loosens the “glue” between the virus and the skin, but also the Velcro-like interactions that hold the proteins, lipids and RNA in the virus together.<br>
Coronavirus hits ill and disabled people hardest.<br>
Alcohol-based products, which includes most “disinfectant” products, contain a high-percentage alcohol solution (typically 60-80% ethanol) and kill viruses in a similar fashion.<br>
But soap is better, because you only need a fairly small amount of soapy water, which, with rubbing, covers your entire hand easily.<br>
Whereas you need to literally soak the virus in ethanol for a brief moment, and wipes or rubbing a gel on the hands does not guarantee that you soak every corner of the skin on your hands effectively enough.<br>
Soap is the best, but do use alcohol-based sanitiser when soap is not handy or practical.<br>
