     The aim of this set of agriculture teaching notes is to teach students
  how food plants work and the reasons for the methods used to look after
crops in the school gardens. These teaching notes will also help students
to understand the other agriculture teaching notes that deal with crop projects.
Each lesson has a set of Revision Questions at the end of the lesson. The
suggested answers are in [square brackets].<br>
         
<hr width="800" size="2"><a name="5.01"></a>5.01 Plant body<br>
     <a href="9.53.GIF">See diagram 9.53:</a> Parts of a plant<br>
     You will need some small plants that have flowers, branches and roots.
  Bring them to the classroom. Give one plant to each pair of students. Point
   to the parts of the plant body.<br>
     The plant body consists of two parts: The shoot above the ground, and
  the root below the ground.<br>
     The shoot is the stem with the leaves.<br>
     The stem is divided by thick parts called nodes.<br>
     Leaves grow from the nodes.<br>
     Roots may grow from nodes when the nodes touch the wet ground, e.g.
sugar  cane or para grass. Roots grow at the root tips.<br>
     A bud is a baby shoot. The terminal bud is at the end of the shoot and
  either makes the shoot grow or forms a flower.<br>
     The axillary buds grow from the nodes. They grow in the angle (axil) 
 between the leaf and the stem. Axillary buds can grow to form lateral shoots
  called branches. The buds at the ends of the branches can either make the
  branch grow or form a flower. Axillary buds make the plant grow short and
  bushy or they can form flowers.<br>
     Leaves make food in the sunlight using air and water. The stem carries
  food and water between the leaves and the roots.<br>
     The stem holds up the leaves, and may store food, e.g. sugar cane.<br>
     Roots take in water and plant nutrients from the soil. Roots hold the
  plant in the ground and may store food, e.g. sweet potato. Plant nutrients
   are chemicals the plants need.<br>
     Flowers can form fruits containing seed. The seeds can grow to form
new  plants.<br>
         
<hr width="800" size="2">5.01 Plant body, revision questions<br>
     What parts are found in the shoot? [Stem, leaves (and buds)]<br>
     What are the two parts of the plant body? [Root and shoot]<br>
     What is a bud? [A baby shoot]<br>
     Which bud makes a plant grow straight and tall? [The terminal bud]<br>
     Which buds make a plant grow bushy and short? [Axillary bud]<br>
     Which buds can produce flowers? [The terminal bud and axillary buds]<br>
     What are plant nutrients? [Chemicals in the soil that plants need]<br>
     What is the function of the stem? [It carries substances between leaves
   and roots, holds up leaves, and may store food.]<br>
     What is the function of the roots? [Roots take in water and plant nutrients
   from soil, old the plant in the ground, and may store food.]<br>
     What is the function of the flower? [To form a fruit containing seed 
 that can grow to become a new plant.<br>
         
<hr width="800" size="2"><a name="5.02"></a>5.02 Photosynthesis, light is 
   needed for photosynthesis<br>
     All food comes originally from green leaves in the sunlight.<br>
     A process is a change in something, or a way in which something is made.
   So you can say that photosynthesis is the process by which green plants
 make food.<br>
     Show the students the prepared demonstrations.<br>
     Where does all your food come from? [Green plants in the sunlight.]<br>
     In sunlight green, plants use carbon dioxide gas from the air, water,
  and plant nutrients from the soil to make food. This process is called
photosynthesis.    ("Photo" means light, "synthesis" means putting together).<br>
     Plant nutrients are chemicals in the soil that plants need, e.g. plant
  nutrients are needed to make the green colour that absorbs the sunlight
energy.<br>
     This energy remains stored in the food. The first food made in green 
 plants is the simple sugar, glucose.<br>
     Photosynthesis equation<br>
     Carbon dioxide gas + water + sunlight energy --&gt; simple sugar (food)
   + oxygen gas.<br>
     The oxygen gas produced by photosynthesis goes out into the air.<br>
     All your food comes originally from photosynthesis in a green plant
because  your food is either plants, or animals that have eaten plants.<br>
     Animals breathe in oxygen gas and breathe out carbon dioxide gas that
  is a waste. Plants use the carbon dioxide gas during photosynthesis and
give out oxygen gas.<br>
     To make food crops grow well they need:<br>
     1. Sunlight, but baby plants need some shade,<br>
     2. Water, but soil must not be waterlogged (filled with water)<br>
     3. Plant nutrients, but they must be the kinds of chemicals the plants
  need,<br>
     4. Green leaves. The leaves must not be damaged by insects or disease,
  and they must not turn brown or yellow.<br>
         
<hr width="800" size="2"><a name="5.03"></a>5.03 Photosynthesis, sunlight 
   is necessary for photosynthesis<br>
     <a href="9.145.1.GIF"> See diagram 9.145.1</a>: Aluminium foil on leaf<br>
     Three days before the lesson fold a piece of aluminium foil to form
a  band around a leaf on a tree growing in the sunlight. After three days,
pick  the leaf off the tree and remove the aluminium foil. Drop the leaf
in boiling  water to kill it. Put the leaf in methylated spirit to remove
the green substance  called chlorophyll. Place the leaf in an iodine solution.
The part of the  leaf not covered by the silver paper turns blue black colour. 
 The part of  the leaf covered by the silver paper does not turn blue black 
 because there  was no sunlight for<br>
     photosynthesis to make starch. Students could form their own initials
  out of silver paper and "write" them on a leaf.<br>
     Do the last part of the demonstration in front of the students.<br>
     The simple sugars produced by photosynthesis are soon changed to starch
   in the leaf.<br>
     When iodine solution is added to starch it changes from a white colour
  to a blue black colour.<br>
     A leaf with a silver paper band around it is left on a tree for three
  days. The leaf is then picked and tested for starch.<br>
     The part of the leaf shaded by the Silver paper shows no starch present.
   The part of the leaf not shaded shows starch.<br>
     Conclusion: Sunlight is necessary for photosynthesis.<br>
         
<hr width="800" size="2"><a name="5.04"></a>5.04 Photosynthesis, oxygen gas 
   is formed during photosynthesis<br>
     <a href="9.145.1.GIF">See diagram 9.145.1:</a> Waterweed in the light
  and in the dark<br>
     Demonstration: Oxygen gas is given off during photosynthesis<br>
     Try out the demonstration a few days before the lesson. The demonstration 
   works best if you can start it the day before the lesson.<br>
     Or, start the demonstration at the beginning of the lesson and allow 
 students to see it again in the next lesson. A suitable waterweed is <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Elodea</span>. The demonstration works better
   if you add some sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) to the water.<br>
     Tests for oxygen gas<br>
     Light a thin piece of wood then blow out the flame leaving the wood
glowing  red. If you put this into oxygen, the glowing wood will burst into
flame.<br>
     Show the students the demonstration.<br>
     Put green waterweed in a test-tube and invert it under water. The test-tube
   contains no air or bubbles in it. This is left in the sunlight. Another
 piece of waterweed is placed under a similar test-tube. This is left in
the  dark. After some hours look at the waterweeds again. The waterweed in
the  light has bubbles of oxygen gas coming from it. No bubbles of oxygen
gas come from the waterweed in the dark. The gas was oxygen because it made
a glowing piece of wood burst into flames.<br>
     Conclusion: During photosynthesis oxygen gas is given off.<br>
         
<hr width="800" size="2">9.0.4 Photosynthesis, revision questions<br>
     What does the word "photosynthesis" mean? ["Putting together using light
   energy"]<br>
     What are the four things green plants need to make food? [Sunlight,
carbon  dioxide gas, water plant nutrients]<br>
     What are two kinds of food made by green plants? [Simple sugars, starch]<br>
     Which gases do green leaves give out? [Oxygen gas]<br>
     What are two ways in which plants help us? [They make food that you
eat.  They make oxygen gas that you breathe.]<br>
     Write the photosynthesis equation: [light energy + carbon dioxide gas
  + water --&gt; simple sugar + oxygen gas]<br>
         
<hr width="800" size="2"><a name="5.07"></a>5.07 Leaves<br>
     <a href="9.66.2.GIF">See diagram 9.66.2:</a> Shapes of leaves<br>
     Collect samples of leaves with different shapes. Some leaves should
be  the leaves of your crops.<br>
     Show the students the leaves you have collected.<br>
     Leaves are usually flat and thin so that they can catch plenty of sunlight
   and have little holes in the lower side to let gases and water vapour
move    in and out.<br>
     The bushy plant the leaf has three parts: 1. leaf, 2. petiole, and 3.
  leaf blade.<br>
     The grass leaf has three parts: 1. leaf blade, 2. leaf sheath, and 3.
  ligule.<br>
     Draw the leaves of the different crop plants you are growing and describe
   their shape.<br>
         
<hr width="800" size="2">5.07 Leaves, revision questions<br>
     Part 1 Draw Diagram: Leaf of a bushy plant and grass leaf on the chalkboard.
   Write the correct labels.<br>
     Part 2 Draw the different shapes of leaves on the chalkboard and name
  them<br>
     Part 3 Why are most leaves flat and thin? [To catch plenty of sunlight]<br>
     What are the parts and functions of the leaf of a bushy plant? [The
leaf  base attaches the leaf to the stem. The petiole turns and holds up
the leaf  blade like a handle. The leaf blade takes in sunlight to make food.]<br>
     What are the parts of a grass leaf? [Leaf blade, leaf sheath and ligule]<br>
     What is the difference between veins in a bushy plant leaf and veins 
 in a grass leaf? [Veins are arranged in a network in a bushy plant leaf.
  Veins are arranged in parallel in a grass leaf.]<br>
     What is the difference between a leaf and a leaflet? [A leaf is attached
   to the stem, and in the angle<br>
     between the leaf and stem is the axillary bud. A leaflet is part of
a  leaf. There is no axillary bud between the leaflet and the stem.]<br>

 href="9.57.1.GIF">See diagram 9.57.1</a>: Wood sections<br>
     The day before the lesson, stand a young plant in a jar containing enough
   red or blue ink to cover the roots. Find a stump of a tree or coconut
that    has been cut down recently. Get a piece of sugar cane, a yam, a taro
corm,    a bit of banana corm and a ginger or tumeric rhizome. You will need
a razor    blade for this lesson.<br>
     Show the students the young plant standing with roots in red ink. Take
  the plant out and wash it. Then cut the stem and open it with a razor blade
   to show the ink inside. What does this prove? [Liquids move up the stem.]<br>
     Show the students the cut stump of a tree. What is the function of the
  wood? [To let the plant become large and strong]<br>
     Eat some sugar cane. What does this show? [Stems can be used to store
  food.]<br>
     Show the students the yam, taro and bit of banana corm.<br>
     Stems have three functions: transport of food from leaves to roots,
transport  of water and plant nutrients from roots to leaves,<br>
     support of leaves and branches. In a young stem only a few leaves can
  be supported. In a large tree many leaves and branches can be supported,
  food storage, e.g. sugar cane.<br>
         
<hr width="800" size="2">5.08 Stems, revision questions<br>
     What are the three functions of stems? [Transport of food, water and 
 plant nutrients between the leaves and the roots, support of the leaves and
branches, storage of food ]<br>
     What is the function of bark? [It protects the stem.]<br>

     Remind the students of the need to transplant carefully so as not to 
 damage the roots or root hairs. Five days before the lesson put some bean
  seeds on wet paper or cotton wool on a plate. Cover with a saucer or another
  plate to keep the seeds damp. After germination you will see small root
hairs growing from the side of the root. Use seed packaged in silver packets
because they will be protected from attack by fungus.<br>
     Most plants take water and plant nutrients into their roots through
tiny  root hairs (but coconuts do not have root hairs). The root hairs are
very  small, have thin walls and are easily damaged. If plants do not get
enough  water the leaves will wilt then dry up and later the plant will die.
If you  damage the root or root hairs during transplanting: insects or disease 
damage  the root, e.g. bacterial wilt disease of tomatoes.<br>
     If there is not enough water in the soil, the soil water is salty. If
  there is too much water in the soil you say that the soil is waterlogged.<br>
     Roots will die in waterlogged soil because they need some air to breathe.
   Soils should be well-drained so that there is some air in them to give
oxygen to the root hairs.<br>
         
<hr size="2" width="800"><a name="5.10.01"></a>5.10.01 Root rhizosphere<br>
     The rhizosphere is the region just around the root hairs and fine roots
   that is influenced by root hair secretions and the local micro-organisms.
   In the rhizosphere the following processes may occur:<br>
     1. Excretion of H<sup>+</sup> that exchanges for nutrient Mg<sup>2+</sup>,
   Ca<sup>2+</sup>, NH4<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>.<br>
     2. Release of carbon dioxide from root hair cells by respiration.<br>
     3. Oxidation of nitrogen and sulfur to nitrate and sulfate ions.<br>
     4. Excretion of organic acids by the root hairs. The organic acids may
  complex metals and increase the mobility of Al<sup>3+</sup> and Fe<sup>3+</sup>.<br>
     5. Depletion of oxygen gas around the root hairs to reduce the redox 
 potential and so favouring Fe<sup>2+</sup> over Fe<sup>3+</sup>.<br>
     6. Removal of water by root uptake.<br>
     7. Change in soil permeability.<br>

     Before the lesson pick enough large flowers so there will be one flower
   for each pair of students.<br>
     Flowers to use<br>
     <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>Poinciana (<span
 style="font-style: italic;">Delonix</span>) flower from a large tree, is 
   a legume and forms large pods. It has five sepals that are thick and green
   on the outside and red on the inside, five separate petals (The upper
one    is more showy.) 10 stamens, and an ovary like a bean pod.<br>
     Hibiscus flower is a large red flower with five sepals, five red petals,
   many stamens attached to a red tube separate from the style that is inside
   it, five stigmas and so five female parts. The flower does not usually
produce seed.<br>
     Sweet Potato flower (<span style="font-style: italic;">Ipomoea</span>) 
   has five sepals joined, five petals joined to form a purple trumpet, five
   stamens attached to the petals, and female part. It can form little black
   seeds. Other suitable flowers are tomato, chilli, wing beans, peanut.<br>
     Give the flowers to the students. What are the shapes, colour and smells
   of the flowers? Shake some pollen out of the flowers.<br>
     Most flowers contain male parts and female parts. Insects are attracted
   to flowers by their shape, colour and smell. They fly from flower to flower
   carrying pollen on their bodies and legs. Pollen comes from the male parts.
   Pollen makes the female part form a fruit and seeds. This is called fertilization.<br>
         
<hr size="2" width="800"> Hold the flower by the stalk and touch the following 
   parts:<br>
     Receptacle: Where the stalk gets wider at the base of the flower. It 
 is a platform for the other flower parts.<br>
     Sepals: Like little green leaves on the outside of the flower. They
project  the young flower in a flower bud.<br>
     Petals: Coloured parts inside the sepals. They attract insects.<br>
     Stamens: The male parts. Each stamen consists of a little stick called
  the filament that holds up a bag called the anther. The anthers produce
pollen. Can you see the pollen coming out of the anthers?<br>
     Stigma: The top of the female part in the middle of the flower. It is
  sticky and can catch the pollen.<br>
     Style: The long tube of the female part below the stigma. Pollen can 
 grow down inside the tube to fertilize the ovary.<br>
     Ovary: The swollen base of the female part that contains ovules. After
  fertilization, the ovary will form a fruit and the ovules will form seeds.<br>
     Count the number of sepals, petals and stamens. Then they should pull
  off some sepals and petals, and open the ovary to see the ovules.<br>

     For this lesson you will need chilli or tomato flowers, one for two
students,  and razor blades. You will also need a chilli or tomato fruit.
Before the  lesson, practice cutting a half flower. To do this hold the flower
upside  down and cut down the middle of the stalk between two of the sepals
and cut  the flower in half. Now check that the stigma, style and ovary are
cut exactly  in half. You will need a magnifying glass to see all the ovules 
in the ovary.  Can you count them? Give a flower to each pair of students. 
Name each part  of the flower as you point to them. Show the students how 
to cut a half flower.  Touch each part of the half flower. Students should 
also touch each part of their half flower and tell you is name and function:<br>
     6. Stalk<br>
     5. Receptacle: platform for other parts<br>
     1. Sepals: protect flower bud<br>
     2. Petals: attract insects<br>
     4a. Stigma: female part, pollen sticks to it<br>
     4b. Style: pollen grows down it<br>
     4c. Ovary: pollen fertilizes it to form a fruit<br>
     7. Ovule: pollen fertilizes it to form seed<br>
     3b. Filament: part of male stamen, holds up anther part<br>
     3a. Anther: part of male stamen, produces pollen<br>
     8. Pollen: can fertilize the ovary and ovules to produce fruit and seed.
   After fertilization, sepals, petals, stamens, stigma, and style usually
 die and fall off.<br>
         
<hr width="800" size="2">5.11 Flowers, revision questions<br>
     Part 1. Show the students a flower, e.g. wing bean. Point to the different

     <a href="9.4.2.GIF">See diagram 9.4.2:</a> Tomato flower and fruit formation<br>
     Collect some green tomatoes and tomato flowers, one of each for each 
 group of four students. You could also use chilli or eggplant (aubergine)
   fruit and flowers. You will need some razor blades and a magnifying glass.
   Examine the flowers and fruit, cut them down the middle with razor blades.
   BE CAREFUL! Show them the ovary (fruit) and ovules (seed). The remains
  of the sepals, petals, stamens, stigma, style, may be seen if they have
  not dropped off.<br>
     After pollen sticks to the stigma and grows down the style into the
ovary,  the ovary swells to form a fruit. The ovules in the ovary become
seeds. Pollination  is when the pollen touches the stigma and sticks to it.
Big flowers are pollinated  by insects. Small flowers such as grass are pollinated 
by the wind. Fertilization  is when the male pollen reaches the ovary and 
ovules. The pollen grows down  the style to the ovary.<br>
     Tell the students to draw their cut tomato flowers and fruit.<br>
     After fertilization, the flower stalk becomes the fruit stalk, the sepals,
   petals, stamens, stigma and style usually die, the ovary becomes the fruit,
   the ovules become seed.<br>

     A fruit is a swollen ovary with one or more seeds inside.<br>
     Kinds of fruit:<br>
     Caryopsis, "grain": single carpel so a single seed is tightly closed 
in  the ovary wall, indehiscent, pericarp fused with thin seed coat. e.g. 
maize  (corn), wheat.<br>
     Capsule: A dry fruit that opens to let the seeds out, e.g. cassava , 
 sweet potato, okra.<br>
     Pod: A dry fruit that opens on two sides to let the seeds out. e.g.
legume  (cowpea, wing bean, peanut)<br>
     Berry: Fruit wall in two layers - outer layer is a tough skin, inner 
 layer is thick and juicy, e.g. tomato, chilli, papaya, guava, banana.<br>
     Citrus fruit: Like a berry with thick peel and oil glands, e.g. orange,
   lime, pomelo.<br>

     Two days before the lesson put some bean seeds in water. Use enough
seed  for each student. Also, have one dry bean seed ready for each student.
Leave  the bean seeds in water in the classroom so the students can observe
the seed coats swell and become wrinkled, then later become smooth when the
insides  of the seed swells. Give each student a dry bean seed.<br>
     See: the hard shiny seed coat, the scar where the seed was originally
  attached to the fruit, the tiny hole (micropyle) at the end of the scar
 to let water and air in. The baby root (radicle) grows out through this
 hole.<br>
     Give each student a bean seed soaked in water. The soaked seed is larger
   and softer because water has gone through the tiny hole. When the water
 goes into the seed coats, they are first wrinkled and later smooth when
the  whole seed swells.<br>
     Cut open the seed coat with a finger nail or razor blade and see the 
 baby plant inside. The two main parts in halves are the cotyledons swollen
  with stored food. Between the cotyledons is the baby shoot (plumule) and
  the baby root (radicle).<br>

     What are the two things you can see when you look at the seed coat?
[Scar  and hole called micropyle]<br>
     What are their functions? [The scar was where the seed was attached
to  the ovary wall. The micropyle lets water and air in, and the radicle
(first  root) grows out through the hole.]<br>

     When you put a bean seed in water why does the seed coat first become
  wrinkled? [Because water soaks into it and makes it swell.]<br>
     Why does the seed coat later become smooth? [Because water then soaks
  into the inside of the seed, which swells and pushes out the wrinkles.]<br>
         
<hr width="800" size="2"><a name="5.15"></a>5.15 Germination<br>
     <a href="9.113.2d.GIF">See diagram 9.113.2d</a>: Bean seeds germinating<br>
     Two weeks before this plant 5-10 bean seeds at different levels as the
  diagram. This can be done behind a piece of glass or in a glass aquarium,
   but keep the seeds in the dark. Before the lesson, dig up germinated bean
   seeds at different stages of germination. In the type of germination in
 the diagram, called epigeal germination, the cotyledons come out of the
ground.  In the other type of germination, hypogeal germination, the cotyledons
remain  below the ground. Show the students the seeds at different stages
of germination.<br>
     Seeds are alive but they breathe very slowly. When a seed is placed
in  the damp ground and water enters the hole the seed becomes very active, 
breathes  more quickly and a new plant starts to grow. This is called germination.
  The baby plant uses the stored food in the seed until it can produce green
   leaves and make its own food.<br>
     Stages in germination of a bean seed: The seed swells and the radicle
  (baby plant root) grows out the hole in the seed coat. The stem below the
   cotyledons grows into a loop. This stem straightens and the cotyledons
and   the first leaves are pushed up out of the ground.<br>
     Conditions for good germination are as follows: 1. Water, 2. Air to
let  the baby plant breathe, 3. Healthy seed, 4. Correct depth of planting,
5.  Correct variety kind of seed for tropical countries<br>
     The problem of poor germination is usually caused by sowing seeds too
  deeply, or over-watering or under-watering. If the seed is planted too
deeply,    the tiny developing plant exhausts the food supply in the endosperm
long   before the shoot and leaves have broken through the soft surface and
it dies.  The general rule is to plant a seed at a depth that equals twice
its width.  Water newly-sown seeds with a mixture of one fifth of a teaspoon
of Epsom  salts in a litre of water to aid the germination process. The magnesium
in  the salts will help stimulate the enzymes that make the food in the endosperm
   more readily available to the young<br>
     seedling. Small seeds should be only lightly covered with soil, but
larger  seeds will be planted at a greater depth. The surface of the soil
dries out  more quickly than it does a few millimetres deeper. So small seeds
that are  surface-sown should be kept moist while the larger seeds should
be given a good soaking at planting time and then watered again only after
they break  through the ground. If you water the larger seeds too much, they
will rot  in the moist soil. The seed of many vegetables and flowering annuals
are F1 hybrids,<br>
     where the plant breeders have combined two different strains each with
  desirable characteristics. However, F1 hybrids usually do not set seed
or    the seeds are not viable.<br>
     To select tomato seed for planting, squeeze the pulp and the seeds on
  absorbent paper, e.g. a paper towel, and spread it evenly<br>
     over the paper. Remove as much pulp as possible and lay the remainder
  in the sun for two weeks to dry the germination inhibiting enzymes. Lay
 the paper towel with seeds uppermost on seed raising mix and lightly cover
   with fine seed mix. Water lightly until the seedlings emerge.<br>

     Collect examples of the different kinds of planting material to show 
 the students in the classroom. Find pictures of planting material mentioned
  in the lesson from your agricultural reference library. Show the students
   the different kinds of planting material and the pictures from the agricultural
   reference library. Planting material means seeds or parts of plants that
   can grow to become a new plant. The parts of plants may be pieces of stems
   or special kinds of stems.<br>
     Seeds are produced in the ovary of a flower after pollen from the stamen
   (father) fertilizes the ovary (mother). So seeds are like the children
of the stamen and the ovary. The pollen that fertilizes the ovary may come
from the same flower as the ovary (self-pollination) or come from a different
 flower on a different plant (cross-pollination). The seeds (children) will
   have a mixture of the different characters of the parent plants. So the
 seeds will be like brothers and sisters. When they grow, they will all look
 like the<br>
     parents and like each other but none will look the same. Plants that 
 grow from parts of plants will grow to look the same as the parent plant.<br>
         
<hr size="2" width="800"> Parts of plants used for planting material:<br>
     Stem cutting: When the nodes of some plant stems touch damp soil, they
  will produce roots. If these stems are cut between the nodes then each
node    can form roots and shoot and grow into a new plant, e.g. sweet potato
or   cassava. Stems or stem tips are cut and planted so that some nodes are
under   the ground and some are above the ground. The nodes under the ground
produce   roots and the nodes above theground produce leaves.<br>
     Corms area swollen stem bases, e.g. taro and banana. The corm will have
   small buds growing from the nodes. The corm can be cut into "bits", which
   are pieces of corm with buds. Each "bit" can be planted to grow into a
new plant.<br>
     Stem tubers are swollen stems or branches that grows in the ground,
e.g.  yams. Each "eye" in the tuber is really a very small leaf and axillary
bud.  The tubers can be cut into pieces, each containing an eye, and planted. 
 Each piece will grow into a new plant.<br>
     Root tubers cannot be used for planting material because there are no
  nodes or axillary buds in roots. However, at the neck of the tuber where
 the root becomes stem axillary buds can sprout, be separated, and then used
 as planting material, e.g. sweet potato or cassava.<br>
     Bulbs are shoots with fleshy leaves that store food, e.g. spring onion.
   Some plants can produce little daughter bulbs that can be separated and
 planted to grow into big plants.<br>
     Shoots are from underground stems that produce shoots from their axillary
   buds. They can be separated by cutting, then planted out, e.g. sword suckers
   of banana corms, tops and slips of pineapples.<br>
     Rhizomes are shoots that grows horizontally underground. It can be easily
   broken into pieces, with each piece containing axillary buds. The axillary
   buds can form new roots and shoots, e.g. ginger or tumeric, and many grasses.<br>
     Aerial suckers are branches which grow in the air than touch the ground.
   Where a node touches the ground, a new plant can grow, e.g. pineapple
aerial    suckers, taro suckers, yam bulbils.<br>

<hr width="800" size="2"><a name="5.19"></a>5.19 Acid &amp; alkaline soils<br>
     <a href="6.65.3.GIF">See diagram 6.65.3</a>: Nitrogen cycle<br>
     Soil pH is a measure of the acidity of the soil, on a scale from 1 to
  14, the pH scale. A neutral substance such as pure water has a value of
7. Strong alkaline solutions have a pH near 14. Strong acids, e.g. hydrochloric
   and sulfuric acid, have a pH value close to 1.<br>
     Most soils have a pH range of 4.0 to 9.5. Most plants prefer a pH of 
 between 5.5 and 7.5, with a pH of 6.2 to 6.5 ideal for most food plants.
  It is desirable to keep the soil's pH in this range. Incorrect soil pH
affects   the availability of many plant nutrients and so affects plant growth.
For   example, phosphorus is an important nutrient for plant growth but if
the   pH drops below 5, the availability of<br>
     phosphorus sharply decreases because the phosphorus in the soil, present
   as phosphates, forms insoluble compounds at low pH, stopping them from
dissolving in water, so plants cannot absorb the phosphorus. At low pH values
many soil bacteria will not survive so changing the turnover rate in nutrient
cycles, including the important nitrogen cycle. The soil pH requirements
of plants vary. Some plants grow well under acidic conditions, while others
grow best in a more alkaline soil; e.g. potatoes and watermelons like slightly
acidic soils, while apples and lucerne grow well in slightly alkaline soils.
Soil acidity increases through the removal of some basic nutrients from the
soil, e.g. calcium leaching and the excessive use of fertilizers, particularly 
 nitrogen fertilizers. To correct low soil pH, use application of lime (calcium 
 compounds) or dolomite (calcium and magnesium compounds). Use 1-5 tonnes 
/ ha of lime to increase the pH of the topsoil to pH 6.5 but it can take several
years to take effect. You can improve the fertility of your garden soils
by treating them so that they are not too acid or too alkaline. Clay soils
need a much greater amount of lime to shift the pH than sandy soils. The
pH scale measures whether substances are acid or alkaline.<br>
     pH 1 very strong acid that can burn you, e.g. battery acid<br>
     pH 6 weakly acid, e.g. soda water<br>
     pH 7 neutral, neither acid nor alkaline, e.g. water<br>
     pH 8 weakly alkaline, e.g. soap<br>
     pH 14 very strong alkali that can also burn you.<br>
     Acids have a sharp raw taste, e.g. unripe oranges or bush limes.<br>
     Alkalis have a slippery feel, e.g. soap, saliva.<br>
     Plants can absorb plant nutrients best when pH is 6 to 7. In soils formed
   from coral rock the pH will be too high. In swampy land the pH will be
too low.<br>
     Experiment<br>
     To lower the pH add rotten compost. To raise the pH add lime.<br>
     In this lesson show how to use a "Soil pH Test Kit".<br>
     You will need: Coral soil or coral sand, well drained dark soil, swamp
  soil. Plants cannot absorb plant nutrients from the soil if the soil is
too acid or too alkaline. Soils that are not well-drained are too acid. Soils 
 made from coral rocks are too alkaline. You can test the soils using a colour 
 test. If the colour of soil in the test turns yellow orange, the soil is 
too acid. If colour if soil in the test turns blue purple, the soil is too 
alkaline. If colour if soil in the test turns dark green, the soil is not 
too acid nor too alkaline.<br>
     Collect just enough soil from just under the surface of the soil to
cover  your little finger nail, and place on a white plate. Shake two drops
of the  indicator on the soil and mix to a paste with the stick. Sprinkle
some special  white power on the paste. Wait a few minutes then match the
colour of the  powder with the colour chart. Do this for swampy soil, coral
soil, dark well  drained soil.<br>
     Acids have a sharp sour taste and can dissolve substances, e.g. in a 
 car battery.<br>
     Alkalis have a slippery feel and can dissolve substances, e.g. soap.<br>
     Plants cannot absorb plant nutrients from the soil if the soil is too
  acid or too alkaline. Soils in swampy ground are too acid for most plants.
   Soils made from coral sand are too alkaline for most plants.<br>
     Make soil less acid by adding burnt shells hammered to a powder, and 
 by draining the soil. Make soil less alkaline by adding rotten plants from
  a compost heap.<br>
     Good soil is dark in colour from the rotten plants and is well drained.
   To make sure that the soil is not too acid and not too alkaline the agriculture
   field officer can do a soil test.<br>

     <a href="9.303.GIF">See diagram 9.303:</a> Insect pests<br>
     Before starting to teach this and the next lesson, make a collection 
 of pests and diseases from your garden. They can usually be preserved in
  methylated spirits. Also, collect diagrams of different pests. make sure
  that your garden is a good example of pest and<br>
     disease control. Check your spray equipment and pesticides. A field
visit  may be useful for this lesson. Show the students the examples of pests
and  diseases that you have collected from the garden.<br>
     To obtain the greatest possible production and cash income from your 
 crops you must control loss by pests and diseases. Pests are animals that
  eat your crops or infect your crop plants with diseases. Pests may live
in the ground, be attached to infected plants or may fly or walk to your
crop. Diseases are any change in the plant such as spots or holes in the
leaves, wilting of the plant, rotting of the living plant. They are caused
by living things that may be so small that they cannot usually be seen by
eye. Diseases are carried by wind and water, infected plants, and pests.<br>
         
<hr size="2" width="800"> The main pests of crops:<br>
     1. Nematode worms or eel worms: They are small worms pointed at both 
 ends and have S-shapes. They attack plant roots and may live in lumps on
  the roots. They attack papayas, tomatoes, and bananas. Killing nematodes
  or eel worms in the soil is very difficult.<br>
     2. Snails and slugs: Slugs are like snails with no shell. They eat plant
   leaves and stems. They can be controlled by picking off by students or
by spraying with "Cuprox".<br>
     3. Spiders: Tiny red spiders called mites attack the leaves of beans 
 and eggplant. A chemical that kills them is called an acaricide, e.g. wettable
   sulfur.<br>
     4. Flies: Small white worms called larvae eat flowers and leaves, e.g.
  bean fly larvae.<br>
     5. Caterpillars: Some butterflies lay their eggs on the leaves and later
   caterpillars hatch out and eat the leaves. They attack cabbages, tomatoes
   and beans.<br>
     6. Mole crickets and grasshoppers: They attack Chinese cabbage and lettuce.<br>
     7. Beetles: Beetles have hard shiny outer wings, e.g. Pumpkin beetle 
 on pumpkins and sweet potato, Rhinoceros beetle on coconut palms.<br>
     8. Bugs: Bugs have soft wings, e.g. vegetable bugs.<br>
     9. Rats: They eat root crops and fruit. They can be controlled by destroying
   their nests and using poisonous bait, e.g. Warfarin.<br>
         
<hr width="800" size="2"><a name="5.20.1"></a>5.20.1 Silverleaf white fly 
   <br>
     Silverleaf white fly, sweet potato white fly, <i>Bemisia tabaci</i>, 
 attacks sweet potato, tomato, cucumber, eggplant, poinsettia, okra, bean.
  It sucks nutriients from phloem or lower leaf surfaces leaving chlorotic
  spots and withered leaves. It produce a sticky substance, "honeydew", on
  which sooty moulds can grow, which reduce light to plant. It is also vector
  for plant diseases, e.g. lettuce yellows virus, tomato yellow leaf curl
virus, and African cassava mosaic, and cassava brown streak virus. There
is no easy way to contol it except by removing weeds near the crop.<br>

     Before the lesson walk out in the garden and look for examples of infected
   plants to show the students. Show the students different examples of plants
   infected by diseases.<br>
     When a disease attacks a plant you say the plant is infected with the
  disease.<br>
     The three main causes of disease in crops:<br>
     1. Fungus diseases: A fungus is like a plant with a body of threads, 
 is not green, and can attack and digest green plants. Many fungi live in
  the damp soil. Chemicals that kill fungi are called fungicides, e.g. "Benomyl",
   "Captan".<br>
     1.1 Damping off fungus disease: This fungus attacks germinating seeds
  and makes all the seedlings fall over and die. It can beprevented by heating
   the soil to kill all the fungi before planting seeds. This is called soil
   sterilization.<br>
     1.2 Collar rot fungus disease: It attacks the stem near the ground.
Leaf  and stem fungus diseases. There are many of these diseases.<br>
     They appear as yellow or brown spots that may later join, then the leaf
   or stem dies.<br>
     1.3 Powdery mildew: It looks like white threads on leaves or stems of
  pumpkins and cucumbers.<br>
     2. Bacterial diseases: Bacteria are tiny living things that are much 
 too small to be seen. They can attack plants and cause them to rot. They
  live in damp places. They cause many diseases, e.g. wilting of tomato plants,
  rotting of the heart of lettuce. These diseases cannot usually be cured,
 but they can be prevented by soaking seeds in very hot water for a short
time.<br>
     3. Virus diseases: Viruses are even smaller than bacteria and these
diseases  cannot be cured. Viruses may cause yellow patches on leaves and
later the  plant dies, e.g. in taro and bananas. These diseases cannot be
cured but if the virus is carried by insects they may be controlled. The
best way to deal with bacterial or virus diseases is to burn the infected
plant or part of the plant.<br>
     4. Diseases are carried to plants in four ways:<br>
     4.1 Wind can carry diseases a short distance.<br>
     4.2 Disease can be carried in running water or in the splash of rain 
 drops.<br>
     4.3 Infected plants can pass disease to healthy plants if the plants 
 are touching.<br>
     4.4 Disease can be carried by insect pests that can then infect healthy
   plan<br>

 diseases<br>
     In this lesson teach the students that you must be looking at your crops
   ever day for signs of pests and diseases. Then you must be ready to decide
   what to do about the pests or diseases. Often the pest or disease is harmless
   or does not do much damage so it is best to either leave it alone or just
   pick off insects or diseased leaves by hand. Yet you must still teach
the    students to look at the crops every day. If the pest or disease is
damaging    your crop so much that you will not get enough to eat from it,
or you cannot    sell it, then be prepared to use pesticide sprays or dusts:
Contact the  agricultural field officer and ask for advice. Clean your spray
pump and try it with water first. Check that you have enough of the right
kind of spray.<br>
     The only really safe pesticides to use in schools are as follows: Benomyl,
   Captan, Mancozeb, Maneb, Methoxychlor, Quintozene, Sulfur, Zineb. Mix
the    pesticide according to the instructions on the label. Do the spraying
yourself    or supervise an older student very closely. Keep the students
away from  the spray. Do not spray on a windy day. Wash your hands and face
(using soap)    after spraying. Clean out the sprayer after use, do not leave
any pesticide    in the sprayer. Store pesticides and chemicals in a safe
place<br>
     away from students. The teacher should show the correct way of spraying
   or dusting of pesticides in the garden<br>
     Show the students examples of good preparation.<br>
     Pests and diseases can be controlled by good preparation before you
plant  the crop. Good management after you have planted the crop. There are
five  methods of good preparation for control of pests and diseases.<br>
     Use healthy planting material. Seeds and cuttings should be clean and
  free of insects or disease spots. Imported seeds in sealed silver packets
   will be free of disease. Select planting material and seeds from plants
 known to be resistant to disease. In village gardens some kinds of yams
resist  disease and some are attacked by disease. Prepare the land properly
so the  plants can grow well. Dig the soil deeply and dig drains near by
so the roots  can grow strongly in the drained soil. Fertilize the plants
to provide enough  plant nutrients. Sick plants are damaged more by pests
and diseases than healthy plants. Dig out and burn all plants from the previous
crop, weeds, and other stray plants, such as male papaya trees. If you get
rid of all unnecessary plants, then pests and diseases will not live on them 
ready to attack your crop. Destruction of diseased or useless plants is called 
garden hygiene. Soil for seed beds or seed boxes can be sterilized by heating 
the soil in an oil drum all day to kill pests and diseases.<br>
     The five methods of control are as follows:<br>
     1. Use healthy planting material<br>
     2. Select resistant planting material<br>
     3. Good land preparation<br>
     4. Garden hygiene<br>
     5. Sterilize soil for seed beds and boxes<br>
         
<hr width="800" size="2">5.22 Pests and diseases, revision questions<br>
     What are the five methods of control of pests and diseases by good preparation
   for the crop? [Use healthy planting material, select planting material
known to be resistant to pests and disease, prepare the land properly, garden
hygiene, sterilize the soil.]<br>
         
<hr width="800" size="2"><a name="5.24"></a>5.24 Crop care<br>
     Show students some examples from your garden of: care of the crop, interplanting,
   need for control of pests and disease. Show them how to control by hand.
   Keep a record of their garden visits and observations in their note books.<br>
     Care of the crop: Keep soil cultivated between plants, well drained
and  free of weeds. This will allow the crop to grow strongly and not lose
any  water and plant nutrients to weeds. Use mulch to protect the soil but
do not let it touch the plant stems because some disease may be in the mulch. 
  Add some compost or artificial fertilizer to provide plant nutrients to 
keep  the crop healthy.<br>
     Interplanting can help plants to help each other so use a mixture of 
 different kinds of plants in a garden, for example:<br>
     Table 5.24<br>
         
<table border="1" width="50%">
     <tbody>
     <tr>
     <td>Row 1 </td>
     <td>Row 2 </td>
     <td>Row 3 </td>
     <td>Row 4 </td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
     <td>sweet potato </td>
     <td>maize (corn) </td>
     <td>sweet potato </td>
     <td>maize (corn) </td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
     <td>climbing bean </td>
     <td>maize (corn) </td>
     <td>pumpkin </td>
     <td>.<br>
     </td>
     </tr>
                
  </tbody>     
</table>
     If the same kinds of plants are separated from each other by other kinds
   of plants, it is harder for pests and disease to spread from one plant
to another. Also some plants can help each other by shading weeds or repelling
   insects, e.g. marigolds will protect other plants from nematode worms,
radishes help other vegetables.<br>
     Control by hand: Insects such as caterpillars, diseased plants and parts
   of plants can be removed by hand and burnt. Crops should be looked at
every    day for signs of pests and disease.<br>
     Garden hygiene: Do not leave diseased plants in the garden - pull them
  all out and burn them. Also look at compost heaps and mulch for signs of
 insects that attack plants, e.g. Rhinoceros Beetle, mole crickets.<br>
     Control by spraying and dusting: Chemical sprays and dusts called pesticides
   can be used. However, they are expensive and have to be handled with care
   because they are poisonous to people. Use sprays or dusts only if it is
 essential, e.g. Carbaryl, Maldison, Dimethoate, Captan, Mancozeb, Acephate.<br>
         
<hr width="800" size="2">5.24 Management, revision questions Give two reasons 
   why it is good to interplant crops. [Less spread of disease, some plants
   can help each other]<br>
     If you interplant corn (maize) with climbing beans how do the beans
help  the corn? [The beans shade weeds and give nitrogen plant nutrients
to the  corn.]<br>
     How does the corn help the beans? [Shades weeds and provides something
  for the beans to climb up.]<br>
     What should you do if you see a few diseased leaves on a plant? [Pull
  them off and burn them.]<br>
     What should you do if the whole plant is diseased and using pesticides
  is not profitable? [Pull it out and burn it.]<br>
     What are the two disadvantages of spraying with pesticides? [They are
  expensive They must be handled with care because they are poisonous to
people.]<br>
     What must you do to your crops every day to guard against pests and
diseases?  [Look at them carefully.]<br>
     Why do you need to control pests and diseases? [Because they decrease
  the production of a crop.]<br>

     Collect some white ash from burnt wood and bring it to the classroom.
  The black ash is carbon. Show the students the white ash you have collected. 
   Let them taste some. It tastes a bit salty. The ash contains plant nutrients.
   Show the students a bag of fertilizer let them read the names written
on    the bag. Do not let the students taste the fertilizer from the bags.
Plant    nutrients are chemicals that plants take in from the soil. Some
people call   them plant foods. These chemicals are needed by the plant to
keep it alive,   to make food, and make the plant body. If there are not
enough plant nutrients   in the soil, the plant will be weak, grow slowly,
and have yellow or brown<br>
     leaves. It may die.<br>
     The most important plant nutrients are as follows:<br>
     1. Nitrogen for plenty of strong green leaves<br>
     2. Phosphorus for root growth and making fruit<br>
     3. Potash (potassium oxide) for healthy plants<br>
     Other important plant nutrients are as follows:<br>
     4. Sulfur and iron for green leaves<br>
     5. Magnesium and calcium for healthy plants<br>
     There are other plant nutrients needed in very small amounts, which
may  be important for some plants, e.g. manganese, boron.<br>
     Most plant nutrients originally come from the rocks that formed the
soil.  Other plant nutrients in the soil have come from plants that have
died then  rotted in the soil. If a soil does not have enough of any plant
nutrient,  e.g. potash, you say it is deficient in potash.<br>
         
<hr width="800" size="2">5.25 Plant nutrients, revision questions<br>

     What should I consider when planting a tree? Choose a plant species
native  to your area. Know the height and width of your tree so you can choose
a site appropriate for the fully grown tree. Dig a hole that is slightly
deeper and wider than the size of the pot. Gently remove the plant from its
container  and place in the hole. Fill around the plant with soil, without
leaving any  gaps. Do not cover the nursery line of the pot (this is where
the trunk and  soil in the pot meet). Mulch around the base, without covering
the nursery  line. Water the seedling.<br>
         
<hr width="800" size="2"><a name="16.8.8"></a>16.8.8 Corn smut<br>
     Corn smut is a fungus <i>Ustilago maydis</i> that causes smut disease
  in corn (maize) plants. The disease is recognised by the appearance of
white    swellings on the stem, leaves and ears of the corn; the swellings
contain    black spores that are carried by the wind to other plants when
the white    swellings break open.<br>

<hr width="800" size="2"><a name="16.9.0"></a>16.9.0 Seed sterilization<br>
     1. Sterilization procedures may be enhanced by:<br>
     1.1 Placing the material in a 70% ethyl alcohol solution prior to treatment 
   with another disinfectant solution. The use of a two-step (two-source) 
sterilization  procedure has proven beneficial with certain species.<br>
     1.2 Using a wetting agent, e.g. "Tween 20", added to the disinfectants 
   to reduce surface tension and allow better surface contact.<br>
     1.3 Conducting the sterilization process under vacuum. This results
in  the removal of air bubbles and provides a more efficient sterilization
 process.<br>
     2. Orchid seeds are very small and contain little food reserves. A single 
   seed capsule contain 1,500 - 3,000,000 seeds. Sowing the seed in vitro 
makes  it possible to germinate immature seed (green pods). It is much easier 
to  sterilize green capsules about two-thirds ripe than individual seeds after
 the capsule has split open. For example, the time to maturity of Cymbidium
   is 10 months.<br>
     For green capsule sterilization, soak the capsule in a 100% bleach solution 
   for 30 minutes. Dip the capsule into 95% alcohol, and flame. Under aseptic 
   conditions, open the capsule and scrape out the seed. Carefully layer the
   seed over the surface of the culture medium.<br>
     3. Dry seed sterilization<br>
     Collect seed and place in either a small flask or bottle, or place in
  a shortened pipette which has one end sealed with cotton. Seal the other
  end of the pipet with cotton, once the seed has been placed in the pipette.
   Prepare a solution containing 5-10% commercial bleach containing a few
drops of Tween 20. Add the bleach solution to the flask, or draw up the solution 
 into the pipette. Swirl the flask containing the seed and bleach or repeatedly 
 draw and aspirate the bleach solution in and out of the pipette. Sterilize 
 the seed for 5-10 minutes. Remove the bleach solution and rinse the seed 
with sterile tissue culture grade water. Transfer the seed to sterile culture 
medium.<br>
