<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.3.0H">4.3.0</a> Organochlorine compounds, organochlorides (chlorinated hydrocarbons)<br>
Safety: Do not use organochlorine compounds in school gardens.<br>
1. The following organochlorine compounds have been banned in Australia and must not be used in schools:<br>
Aldrin, BHC, Chlordane, DDT, Dieldrin, Endrin, Heptachlor, Hexachlorophene, Isodrin, Lindane, Pentachlorophenol (PCP) C6HCl5O, 2,4,5-T.<br>
 2. The following pesticides are too dangerous for use in school food gardens:<br>
 2.1 Organochlorine compounds: DDT, benzene hexachloride (Lindane, gammexane BHC), aldrin (chlordane, dieldrin, heptachlor epoxide, endrin).<br>
Organochlorines are composed only of carbon, hydrogen and chlorine.<br>
They are biologically very active, but not easy to breakdown, hence persistent.<br>
They have one or more chlorine atoms attached to the carbon atoms, replacing hydrogen.<br>
The term "organochlorine" refers to a wide range of organic chemicals, which contain chlorine and sometimes several other elements.<br>
They have been used in Australia as herbicides, insecticides, fungicides and industrial chemicals, e.g. polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).<br>
They are very stable compounds that can be distributed in the environment, where they persist long after their original use.<br>
They degrade slowly and being fat soluble, accumulate in the food chain, eventually ending up in the fat of the human body.<br>
The key properties of organochlorines that cause concerns are persistence and toxicity.<br>
Organochlorine pesticides were manufactured for their toxicity.<br>
They were also persistent sp had advantages in that they remained effective against target pests for prolonged periods.<br>
They are used to protect crops, livestock, buildings and households from the damaging effects of insects.<br>
Commonly used organochlorine compound insecticides were DDT, Lindane, chlordane, dieldrin, aldrin and heptachlor.<br>
Fungicides included hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and chlorinated phenols, e.g. pentachlorophenol.<br>
Herbicide 2,4,5-T was also used.<br>
Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) was used in the past as a fungicide (seed disinfectant, seed paint), but is now banned in Australia.<br
Now it appears as a widespread contaminant in many environments.<br>
It was deregistered for general use between 1985 and 1987.<br>
Chlorinated phenols, e.g. pentachlorophenol (PCP) have been widely used in Australia to protect softwood timber from decay.<br>
Also, 2,4 5-T was used in the past as a herbicide against broad leaf woody plants, as a defoliant.<br>
The use of almost all the chemicals mentioned above is now banned in Australia.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.3.1H">4.3.1</a> DDT<br>
Safety: Do not use DDT in school gardens.<br>
<a href="topicIndexD.html#DDTH">DDT</a>, the new chemical name is 1,1-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-2,2,2-trichloroethane.<br>
The old name was dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, hence "DDT".<br>
DDT is a organochlorine contact insecticide that kills by acting as a nerve poison.<br>
It is a highly effective insecticide, and is of very low toxicity to mammals.<br>
It is odourless and tasteless, has a high persistence, and is chemically stable.<br>
However, insects can develop resistance to DDT by natural selection of surviving members with enzymes that can detoxify it.<br>
DDT and its metabolic breakdown product can accumulate in the fat of birds and fish, and even people, at the end of the food chain.<br>
It may cause birds to produce thin shell eggs that break easily.<br>
So the advantage of it being chemically stable is now seen as a major disadvantage.<br>
It was also used in large quantities in the control of mosquitoes, which caused malaria in tropical countries.<br>
There has been a total ban on the use of DDT in Australia since 1987.<br>
The technical product "DDT", which is a mixture of isomers, principally p,p'-DDT, with lesser amounts of o,p'-DDT.<br>
Once stored in fatty tissue, DDT residues are sequestrated and stabilized, unless they are mobilized either by lactation or great weight loss.<br>
They are all strongly suspected of being environmental endocrine disruptors, i.e. chemicals that affect the hormonal system.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.3.2H">4.3.2</a> Methoxychlor<br>
Safety: Do not use Methoxychlor in school gardens.<br>
<a href="Methoxychlor.png">See diagram</a> Methoxychlor<br>
Methoxychlor, C16H15Cl3O2, is an organochlorine insecticide.<br>
It is a contact and stomach poison, very safe to use, and has long persistence.<br>
Methoxychlor is pale yellow powder and has a fruity or musty odour.<br>
It is used to kill flies, mosquitoes, cockroaches, chiggers and others.<br>
Methoxychlor is a general insecticide for food crops, household pests, farm animals, pets and grain storage.<br>
It is available as wettable powder (W.P.), emulsifiable concentrate (E.C.), dusts, and in aerosol cans.<br>
It has oestrogenic effects on mammals.<br>
Methoxychlor is a biodegradable analogue of DDT.<br>
While non-polar compounds, e.g. DDT, stay dissolved in the fat of the body, polar substances, e.g. methoxychlor, are water soluble and can be excreted to<br>
be further attacked by other organisms.<br>
DDT and pyrethrins keep open the sodium channel of the insect nerve cell, but not the mammal nerve cell, so sodium ions leak in causing continuous<br>
transmission of nerve impulses.<br>
The insect dies of exhaustion and you can observe the frantic activity of house flies sprayed with DDT.<br>
When DDT sprays were introduced an advertisement stated "They fly outside to die".<br>
Methoxychlor can enter your body when you breathe contaminated air, eat contaminated food, get it on your skin and use garden products or pet sprays.<br>
High doses of methoxychlor could cause damage to the nervous system, but low levels of methoxychlor will leave the body so quickly that this type of damage is not likely.<br>
The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set a reference dose (RfD) for methoxychlor at 0.005 milligrams per day.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.3.2.1H">4.3.2.1</a> Piperonyl butoxide, PBO, C19H30O5<br>
Synthetic pyrethroids contain natural pyrethrum with the synergist piperonyl butoxide, but these products are not allowed in some countries.<br>
DDT, methoxychlor, and pyrethrins are more efficient if piperonyl butoxide (PBO) is already added to the insecticide to give a synergistic effect.<br>
This additive is not itself an insecticide, but it deactivates enzymes for detoxification of the pesticide in the insect.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.3.3H">4.3.3</a> Lindane<br>
Do not use Lindane in school gardens.<br>
Lindane, C6H6Cl6 or ClCH(CHCl)4CHCl, beta-HCH, 1,2,3,4,5,6-Hexachlorocyclohexane, gamma-HCH, gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (Î³-HCH), gammaxene, [wrongly-named, benzene hexachloride (BHC)], variant of hexachlorocyclohexane, (HCB).<br>
Benzene hexachloride, chlorothalanil, DCPA, dalapon.<br>
Lindane, is an insecticide with different names, made by the addition of chlorine to benzene.<br>
The 7-isomer is the insecticide of the nine isomers formed.<br>
The insecticide Lindane is more than 5-20 times more toxic to insects than DDT.<br>
Lindane, gamma-isomer of benzene hexachloride, is a a colourless crystalline solid with a slight musty odor that emits toxic fumes of hydrochloric acid and other chlorinated compounds when heated to decomposition.
Lindane is used as an insecticide for hardwood logs and a topical pediculicide and scabicide
Inhalation exposure to Lindane causes severe irritation of the nose and throat, and affects the liver, and other body systems.
 Lindane has not been produced in the United States since 1976, but is imported for insecticide use.
It was used for control of insect pests in stored seed, to control white grubs in pineapples, against ectoparasites on food.<br>
It was deregistered for general use in 1985.<br>
Generic Lindane is still available by prescription for head lice, but it appears that Lindane is not as effective against lice as it once was.<br>
Hexachlorobenzene has been used as a pesticide, but is no longer registered for this use in Australia.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.4.0H">4.4.0</a> Organophosphate and carbamate insecticides<br>
Do not use organophosphate and carbamate insecticides in school gardens.<br>
Organophosphorus insecticides<br>
The following pesticides are too dangerous for use in school food gardens:<br>
Organophosphorus insecticides: chlorpyrifos, parathion, malathion, dimethoate, dichlorvos, mevinphos.<br>
High persistence chlorinated pesticides are being replaced by the organophosphorus group that has a range of activity, persistence, and specificity.<br>
Their general formula is (RR'X) P = 0, where R and R' are short chain groups and X is a group that it is easily removed from the molecule either after a 
reaction in the body, so persistence is reduced, e.g. carbaryl.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.4.01H">4.4.01</a> "Cyclodiene" pesticides, aldrin, chlordane, dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor<br>
Do not use "Cyclodiene" pesticides in school gardens.<br>
Chlordane, aldrin, dieldrin, heptachlor, endosulfan<br>
Hexachloropentadiene, C5Cl6 (Diels-Alder reaction) --> cyclodienes, e.g. aldrin C12H8Cl6, chlordane C10H6Cl8, dieldrin C12H8Cl6O, endrin C12H8Cl6O, endosulfan, C9H6Cl6O3S, heptachlor C10H6Cl7.<br>
These pesticides are now banned in most countries.<br>
They are broad spectrum insecticides, highly toxic to insects and mammals, and with high persistence.<br>
They also accumulate in body fats and act on the central nervous system.<br>
The compound may itself be non-toxic, but is converted to a toxic form in the body.<br>
They remain in the mammal body, measured as a half residence time, to be detoxified in the liver and excreted by the kidneys, leaving some stored in body<br>
fat to be released during illness, stress and lactation, maternal milk.<br>
Aldrin and dieldrin are active against insects by contact or ingestion.<br>
Their primary use was for the control of termites around buildings, corn pests by application to soil and in the citrus industry, termite proofing of plastic and 
rubber coverings of electrical and telecommunication.<br>
In 1970, the US Department of Agriculture cancelled all uses of aldrin and dieldrin based on the concern that these chemicals could cause severe aquatic environmental change and are potentially carcinogenic, so Aldrin and dieldrin have not been produced in the United States since 1974.<br>
Aldrin and dieldrin are classified as hazardous wastes that should be incinerated.<br>
Aldrin was used as a soil treatment, pre-planting, for crops, e.g. sugar cane, it was used in ant control as well as subterranean termite control, the protection 
 of power poles from termites, and domestic control of fleas, flies, lice and mites.<br>
Chlordane, dieldrin, aldrin and heptachlor, were marketed to complement DDT.<br>
Chlordane was used to control termites, various types of ants, borers, lawn beetles, curl grubs, cut worms and black beetles.<br>
Dieldrin was used against locusts and argentine ants, in the protection of electricity and telephone cable, soil treatment in farm and industrial premises for 
control of termites in buildings, fences and similar structures.<br>
Endosulfan was used widely to control insect pests, but is now banned or is being banned in most countries, because of its acute neurotoxic properties.<br>
Heptachlor, a persistent organic pollutant, was used similarly to chlordane, in soil treatment in crops for control of funnel ants and grubs of the grey-black 
beetle in cane growing areas, and banana beetle borer in banana plantations.<br>
In some countries it still has a limited use to control fire ants.<br>
