<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.4.0aH">4.4.0a</a> Herbicides<br>
Herbicides, weedicides, commonly called weedkillers, are chemicals that are poisonous to plants and are used to kill unwanted plants.<br>
Some herbicides cause a range of health effects ranging from skin rashes to death.<br>
Herbicides should be used correctly and stored and disposed of safely.<br>
Dishwashing liquids contain surfactants (surface-acting agents) that may be added to herbicides to reduce the surface tension on the leaves of 
sprayed plants to allow the herbicide to stick evenly to the leaf surface and ensure maximum absorption.<br>
This process is valuable when spraying leaves with a wax or hair surface, because it stops formation of beads of weedicide apart from the leaf surface.<br>
However, some dishwashing liquids may neutralize the effect of the active ingredient of the weedicide by binding chemically with it.<br>
Also, dishwashing liquids may cause excessive foaming to damage spraying equipment.<br>
Non-ionic surfactants, "non-ionic wetters", are recommended to replace dishwashing liquids added to weedicides.<br>
If the weedicide already contains a "built-in" surfactant, there is no need to add more surfactants to the weedicide.<br>
Granular formulations of weedicide require the addition of non-ionic surfactants to work correctly.<br>
However, surfactants may be toxic to fish and frogs, but some "aquatic safe" herbicide formulations are commercially available.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.4.1H">4.4.1</a> Weedicide, (2,4-D)<br>
(2,4-D), (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid)<br>
Do not use (2,4-D) in school gardens.<br>
<a href="../images/16.13.11chd.gif">See diagram 16.13.11</a>: 2, 4-D.<br>
(2,4-D), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, Cl2C6H3OCH2CO2H<br>
The phenoxyacetic acid herbicides are 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T and its precursor 2,4,5-trichlorophenol (TCP).<br>
The selective herbicide 2,4-D is toxic to broad leafed plants, but less harmful to grasses.<br>
This hormone weed killer 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid is an aryloxyalkanoic acid known also as a "phenoxy herbicide", 
including MCPA, mecoprop, triclopyr and 2,4,5-T.<br>
Their actions against weeds resembling those of auxins (growth hormones).<br>
Absorbed 2,4-D is translocated within the plant and accumulates at the growing points of roots and shoots where it inhibits growth.<br>
The principal use is for the control of broad leaf weeds in cereal crops, including wheat, maize, rice, sorghum, grassland and turf areas.<br>
It is also widely used in mixtures with other herbicides to provide weed control in forestry, orchards and non-crop areas, and aquatic weeds.<br>
2,4-D is a WHO Class II "moderately hazardous" pesticide, in the same class as endosulfan, lindane, paraquat and toxaphene.<br>
It has an LD50 of 375 mg / kg in rats with evidence suggesting a similar level of toxicity in humans.<br>
Occupational exposure to 2,4-D has produced serious eye and skin irritation, nausea, weakness and fatigue, and inflammation of nerve endings.<br>
The various chemical forms of 2,4-D can have different toxic effects.<br>
Orthocarboxylic acids, e.g. picloram, can behave in a similar manner and is more potent than 2,4-D.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.4.2H">4.4.2</a> Weedicide, (2,4,5-T)<br>
<a href="#4.4.2H">4.4.2</a> (2,4,5-T), (2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid)<br>

(TCDD), 1,4,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, C12H4Cl4O2, (and other formulations)<br>
(2,4-D), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, Cl2C6H3OCH2CO2H<br>
Production of 2,4,5-T was contaminated with the carcinogenic dioxin TCDD.<br>
<a href="../images/16.13.11chd.gif">See diagram 16.13.11</a>: 2,4,5-T.<br>
Abnormal foetal skeletal development, increased foetal mortality and other reproductive effects may be associated with exposure to phenoxy-acid 
herbicide and their dioxin contaminants.<br>
2,4-D has low soil absorption and a high potential for leachability and 2,4-D residues have been recorded in groundwater and surface water.<br>
Some formulations of 2,4-D are highly toxic to fish.<br>
<a name="4.4.3H"></a>
2,4,5-T, 2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxyacetic acid, "Weedone", Acetic acid, (2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy)-555, C8H5Cl3O3.<br>
This herbicide was formerly used for industrial sites, lumber yards and vacant lots, range land and rice, lawns and turf, aquatic use, home use,
recreation areas, food crops for humans.<br>
2,4,5-T is used post emergence alone or with 2,4-d for the control of shrubs and trees.<br>
It is also used for girdling, injection or cut stump treatment.<br>
It has been used as a growth regulator to increase size of citrus fruits and reduce excessive drop of deciduous fruit<br>
It has been used for weed control in lakes and ponds at 22-45 kg / ha, and along ditches and irrigation networks.<br>
The use of 2,4,5-T in the United States has been cancelled since 1985.<br>
It is odourless, but is an irritant to eyes, nose, and throat.<br>
The persistence of 2,4,5-T does not exceed one full growing season.<br>
Biodegradation of 2,4,5-T to 2,4,5-trichlorophenol appears to be the dominant removal mechanisms.<br>
2,4,5-T is was one of the most rapidly decomposed herbicides.<br>
2,4,5-T has been qualitatively identified in drinking water.<br>

Dalapon is a herbicide that is used to kill grasses in many crops and drainage ditches.<br>
Dalapon Na is a selective poison that is taken in by the plant and moves through it to kill all parts, including the roots.<br>
It acts slowly over 2-3 weeks.<br>
It is safe to use, but causes irritation to the eyes and skin of some people.<br>
Dalapon can control most annual and perennial grasses, because it will kill every plant it touches.<br>
Dalapon is available as a water soluble powder.<br>

Dinoseb should not be used in school gardens.<br>
Dinoseb, (2-sec-butyl-4, 6-dinitrophenol), C10H12N2O5, is a dinitrophenol fungicide and insecticide.<br>
It is used as a contact herbicide for post-emergence weed control in cereals, undersown cereals, seedling lucerne and peas.<br>
Dinoseb is also used as an insecticide and miticide.<br>
The use of dinoseb is banned in some countries, because it is known to cause birth defects and sterility if it gets into the drinking water.<br>
However, the EPA in USA determined that the 0.007 mg/L or 7 ppb MCLG and 0.007 mg/L or 7 ppb MCL for dinoseb are protective of human health.<br>

DCMU should not be used in school gardens.<br>
DCMU, C9H10Cl2N2O, [(1,1-dimethyl,3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl) urea)], diuron, inhibits photosynthesis.<br>
It is a broad-spectrum residual herbicide and algicide used for pre-emergent and post-emergent control of both broadleaf and grass weeds in agriculture.<br>
It is used to control weeds in pineapples, sugarcane and cotton plantations.<br>
It is also used to control weeds and algae in and around water bodies and is a component of marine anti-fouling paints.<br>
The use of diuron on tropical crops, e.g. tea, coffee, and pawpaw is restricted in Australia.<br>

Only the teacher can use glyphosate in school gardens.<br>
However, based on a review of current research evidence, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, (IARC), an agency under WHO, 
upgraded the carcinogenic status of the herbicide glyphosate.<br>
Glyphosate, N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine (C3H8NO5P), (HO)2P(O)CH2NHCH2CO2H, "Roundup", "Rodeo", "Accord", "Zero"<br>
Glyphosate phosphonate, broad spectrum systemic herbicide, may be carcinogenic.<br>
<a href="../images/16.13.6chd.gif">See diagram: 16.13.6</a>: Glyphosate.<br>
1. Glyphosate, gives non-selective control of all grasses and broadleaf weeds, as well as onion weed, bamboo, lantana, blackberry and unwanted trees.<br>
It is used for economical and easy control of weeds when clearing garden beds before planting, and it is non-residual.<br>
Use 200 mL of the concentrated formula to make up to 50 L of spray.<br>
It is absorbed by the foliage then translocated down to the roots to destroy roots and then the whole grass plant.<br>
The first signs after spraying are a gradual yellowing and wilting of the plant, then a complete browning of the entire weed and the death of the root.<br>
It is less effective if the weeds are not actively growing and the dry soil causes the stomata to close, poor leaf cover on weeds, e.g. waxy leaves, 
rainfall up to 6 hours after application, and if sprayed late in the afternoon.<br>
To allow translocation down to the roots and the chemical to take effect, the weeds should not be disturbed or cut after spraying.<br>
2. Commercial glyphosate products may contain inert ingredients, i.e. anything added to the product other than an active ingredient, e.g. glyphosate 41%, 
polyethoxylated tallow amine surfactant 15% and water 44%.<br>
It may contain the contaminant N-nitrosoglyphosate, (NNG).<br>
The registered use status is "General Use".<br>
It can control many difficult weeds, e.g. nut grass, couch grass, Johnson grass, <i>Sorghum halepense</i>, paspalum, kikuyu grass, blady grass, 
Guinea grass, purslane.<br>
It is used in forestry and noxious weed control to control grasses, herbaceous plants, but not all broadleaf woody plants.<br>
It is absorbed by leaves and prevents production of an essential amino acid and inhibits plant growth.<br>
It is broken down by some plants to mainly aminomethylphosphonic acid.<br>
<a name="4.4.10H"></a>
Do not allow spray drift to contact desirable plants!<br>
It is safe to operators and has no residual activity in the soil, because glyphosate and the surfactants formulations are strongly adsorbed by soil.<br>
However, it remains unchanged in the soil, depending on soil texture and organic matter content, until soil micro-organisms break it down.<br>
Glyphosate and the surfactant are not absorbed from the soil by plants.<br>
It may be harmful to fish, but it does not build up, bioaccumulate, in fish.<br>
It is usually non-toxic to birds, mammals and bees.<br>
In tests in male and female rats, the acute oral LD50 was 4320 mg / kg.<br>
It does not cause genetic damage or birth defects, and no noticeable effect on fertility, reproduction, or development.<br>

Phenoxyacetic acids can mimic the natural auxin, plant hormone, indole acetic acid and are not destroyed by the plant.<br>
They can also be used in setting unfertilized fruits and promoting root growth.<br>
When used in excess they can be used as herbicides.<br>
MCPA is used to kill dicotyledon weeds in monocotyledon cereal crops.<br>
Equal amounts are absorbed by weeds and cereals, but the cereals remain unharmed, because of the differences in their growing shoot structure.<br>

 Paraquat, C12H14N2+2, is the trade name for N,N'-dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridinium chloride.<br>
 Paraquat is a poisonous dipyridilium compound used as contact herbicide.<br>
 Concentrated solutions of Paraquat causes irritation of the skin, cracking and shedding of the nails, and delayed healing of cuts and wounds.<br>
 It is a contact fast action poison.<br>
 Paraquat is a very dangerous chemical that can kill people if swallowed.<br>
 It is not poisonous after touching the clay in soils and there is no persistence in soil.<br>
 There should be a 9-day withholding period before harvest.<br>
 It controls most broad leaf annual weeds and grasses and works best when weeds are 2-15 cm high.<br>
 It is not very effective on perennials with good root systems.<br>
 It kills water weeds.<br>
 Keep livestock away when spraying Paraquat.<br>
 Paraquat is available as water solution.<br>
 Mix with water and immediately spray on leaves.<br>
 Paraquat, Diquat and Cyperquat are quaternary ammonium herbicides related to cationic surfactants that kill by contact with the plant foliage.<br>
 They cannot enter the plant via its roots, because they are very strongly adsorbed onto clay and soil particles.<br>
 They are used to kill weeds between crops or just before a crop emerges.<br>
 They are toxic to humans.<br>

 Before starting to teach this and the next lesson, make a collection of pests and diseases from your garden.<br>
 They can usually be preserved in methylated spirits.<br>
 Also, collect diagrams of different pests.<br>
 Make sure that your garden is a good example of pest and disease control.<br>
 Check your spray equipment and pesticides.<br>
 A field visit may be useful for this lesson.<br>
 Show the students the examples of pests and diseases that you have collected from the garden.<br>
 To obtain the greatest possible production and cash income from your crops you must control loss by pests and diseases.<br>
 Pests are animals that eat your crops or infect your crop plants with diseases.<br>
 Pests may live in the ground, be attached to infected plants or may fly or walk to your crop.<br>
 Diseases are any change in the plant such as spots or holes in the leaves, wilting of the plant, rotting of the living plant.<br>
 They are caused by living things that may be so small that they cannot usually be seen by eye.<br>
 Diseases are carried by wind and water, infected plants, and pests.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.5.2H">4.5.2</a> Insecticide types, contact, ingestion, systemic<br>
Most insecticides kill insects by attacking the nervous system.<br>
These chemicals can also harm humans, especially children, so they must be used and stored with great care when used in school food gardens.<br>
Insects can take in insecticides in 3 ways:<br>
1. Contact poison<br>
The insecticide touches the body of the insect, which then absorbs it.<br>
2. Ingestion or stomach poisons<br>
The insecticide is sprayed onto plants and the insects eat the plants.<br>
3. Systemic poison<br>
The insecticide is sprayed onto plants that absorb it into the sap.<br>
Then sap-sucking insects suck up insecticide in the sap.<br>
However, most insecticides are taken in by more than one way.<br>
Insecticides may kill the good insects, e.g. bees and ladybirds, as well as the bad insects which eat the crops.<br>
So use insecticides only when the bad insects cannot be controlled in any other way.<br>
If the bad insects are not doing much damage to crops, then do not use insecticides.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.5.3H">4.5.3</a> Insecticides<br>
Insecticides are chemicals used to kill eggs, larvae and adult insects by direct contact or by the insect eating the treated plants.<br>
Pyrethrum and neem, <i>Azadirachta indica</i>, are natural insecticides.<br>
<a href="../biology/UNBiolN3A.html#AzadirachtaspH">Neem oil</a>, <i>Azadirachta indica</i>, Meliaceae<br>
Insecticides based on the nicotine from cigarette butts are now banned.<br>
Insecticides may be harmful to humans and farm animals, and should be used correctly and stored and disposed of safely.<br>
Systemic insecticides are insecticides taken to all parts of the plant.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.5.4H">4.5.4</a> Inorganic chemical insecticides<br>
These chemicals are persistent stomach poisons that kill chewing insects, e.g. caterpillars, but not sucking insects, e.g. aphids, mosquitoes.<br>
Other inorganic chemicals are used as attractants, repellents and synergists.<br>
Inorganic insecticides are usually heavy metal compounds, particularly of lead, mercury, e.g. dimethyl mercury antifungal agent and insecticide, arsenic, antimony.<br>
Also, some are fluoride salts, e.g. NaF, sulfur, polysulfides and borax.<br>
1. Borax (Na2B4O7) is used as a cockroach and ant poison and is harmful to mammals.<br>
Do not use in school gardens.<br>
2. Copper chrome arsenate, (CCA), is used to treat timber, wood: <a href="../topics/topic12B.html#12.2.2.1H">12.2.2.1</a><br>
It is used to preserve fence posts and garden furniture giving a green colour.<br>
Such treated timber is safe for normal use, but the sawdust and smoke from burning may contain dangerous levels of arsenic.<br>
(However, the white powder seen on some newly purchased timber is probably harmless sodium sulfate.)<br>
Do not use in school gardens.<br>
3. Copper (II) sulfate and lime is used in Bordeaux mixture.<br>
Do not use Bordeaux mixture in school gardens.<br>
4. Lead arsenate, (PbHAsO4), is a heavy metal compound that is insoluble in water and so not readily absorbed by plants on contact.<br>
The lead blocks essential sites on enzymes and so it is non-specific.<br>
It is toxic to all living systems and extremely persistent.<br>
Do not use in school gardens.<br>
5. Sodium fluoride, (NaF), and cryolite, (Na3AlF6), liberate fluoride ions to precipitate Mg2+ as fluorophosphate, 
thus affecting magnesium-dependent enzymes.<br>
It is non-specific and toxic to animals.<br>
Do not use in school gardens.<br>
6. Sulfur as elemental sulfur, S, and the soluble lime sulfur, (CaS), experiences aerial oxidation to SO2, to act as a safe fungicide and acaricide.<br>
It has some use as an insecticide.<br>
7. Petroleum oils, petroleum oil spray (PSO) are also "white oil", and "summer oil", and "winter oil" are poisonous to some scale insects.<br>
They are fairly safe to use, but there should be a one day withholding period, before harvest of the sprayed crop.<br>
The classification of petroleum oils is based on the temperature at which 5% of the constituents boil, e.g. C21, C23, C24 oils.<br>
The latter has less phytotoxicity.<br>
The oil droplets on the plant must all join together to kill all the insect pests.<br>
These oils are used in 2 ways:<br>
1. They can control scale insects, e.g. on citrus trees.<br>
2. They can be mixed with other insecticides, e.g. Carbaryl, to spread them better on the plants.<br>
Concentrations: 0.25% = 250 mL oil in 100 L water, 2% = 2 L oil in 100 L water.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.5.5H">4.5.5</a> Neonicotinoid insecticides<br>
Neonicotinoid insecticides, neonics are systemic insecticides, so taken to all parts of the plant, used for seed and pot plant soil treatment, turf spray,
foliar spray in glass houses for fruit trees.<br>
They have been blamed for the present decline in the bee population and so have been partially banned in some countries.<br>
The European Food Safety Authority gave the most compelling evidence that toxic chemicals "neonicotinoid pesticides" could be responsible for the bee deaths.<br>
Research has shown that bees cannot control their exposure to neonicotinoids in food, so treating flowering crops with Imidacloprid and ThiamethoxamTMX 
presents a sizeable hazard to foraging bees.

Pyrethrin, Chrysanthemum monocarboxylic acid pyrethrolone ester, C21H28O3, is a yellow-brown liquid with distinct odour, that sinks in water.<br>
Pyrethrins are two almost identical organic compounds extracted from the pyrethrum flower <i>Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium</i>.<br>
Pyrethrins have an immediate knock down effect on flying insects, but a second poison may be needed to kill them.<br>
They have low toxicity to mammals.<br>
Allethrin insecticide is an organic compound that is the same as pyrethrin, but made in a factory.<br>
Permethrin is an organic compound that is similar to pyrethrin, but is made in a factory.<br>
Chilli, pyrethrin and permethrin are stomach poisons and contact insecticides.<br>
They are safe to use, but some people are made sick by them.<br>
They are not persistent and there is no withholding period.<br>
These poisons kill most pests quickly, so are called "knockdown sprays".<br>

Caution before using pesticides<br>
1.0 Pesticides are chemicals that can kill pests.<br>
Insecticide kills insects, fungicide kills fungus and sometimes bacteria.<br>
Miticide or acaricide kills mites and spiders.<br>
Nematicide kills nematode worms.<br>
Molluscicide kills slugs and snails.<br>
Rodenticide kills mice and rats.<br>
Herbicide or weedicide kills weeds.<br>
2.0 Do not use any pesticides not mentioned in this chapter.<br>
All pesticides are dangerous to humans, especially children, so they must be used and stored with care if they are used in a school food gardens.<br>
Use pesticides only if there is no other way of saving your crop.<br>
If you want to use pesticides always tell the headmaster what you intend to do.<br>
3.0 The rules for using pesticides are as follows:<br>
*. Read the directions on the container before opening.<br>
Make sure that you have the right pesticide for the particular pest.<br>
Make sure that you understand how much pesticide to use.<br>
Make sure that your sprayer and tank is clean and working.<br>
Try it out with water first.<br>
*. Do not breathe in pesticide or spill it on your skin don't smoke or eat when using pesticides.<br>
If you spill pesticide on your skin, wash it off with plenty of soap and water straight away.<br>
*. Wear special protective clothing and wash yourself after spraying.<br>
Always handle concentrates with rubber gloves used only for that purpose.<br>
Wear a work shirt, buttoned down to the wrists, long trousers and boots.<br>
*. Spray on a calm day.<br>
*. After spraying, dig a hole in the bush and pour down it any makeup spray left in the tank.<br>
Wash out the sprayer and pump and pour the washing water down the hole.<br>
*. Store the unused pesticides in a safe place where children cannot enter.<br>
Always use the old container, do not store in a new container, e.g. a drink bottle.<br>
Do not store pesticides near food.<br>
*. The pesticide you will buy will often be in a concentrated form so you must follow a proper mixing procedure.<br>
Always use a plastic measuring cylinder or the special measure some pesticide factories make so you do not guess amounts of pesticide.<br>
Dusts are blown or sprinkled onto plants without using water.<br>
4.0 Mixing procedure for a liquid pesticide:<br>
* Fill sprayer tank half way with water.<br>
* Add measured amount of chemical to sprayer.<br>
* Fill sprayer tank with water.<br>
* Shake the sprayer.<br>
5. Mixing procedure for a powder pesticide:<br>
* Put small quantity of water in bucket.<br>
* Put measured quantity of pesticide powder on top of water, leave until it is thoroughly wetted and then mix into a paste.<br>
* Add water, then add to half filled knapsack as per instructions for liquid pesticides.<br>
 If this is not done, some wettable powder will go lumpy and give mixing problems.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.6.2H">4.6.2</a> Pesticides and herbicides safety<br>
 Pesticides are chemicals used for destroying insects or other organisms harmful to cultivated plants or to animals.<br>
 Pesticides may be harmful to humans and farm animals and should be used correctly and stored and disposed of safely.<br>
 Pesticides can be divided into the following:<br>
 1. Baits and traps, e.g. sticky tapes and glues, barrier paints, fruit fly traps, which may be indiscriminate and affect beneficial as well as harmful insects.<br>
 2. Contact poisons to be absorbed through the cuticle by spraying or by walking on sprayed fruit and leaves, e.g. pyrethrum, rotenone.<br>
 3. Desiccants that wear away the waxy exoskeleton or dissolve the waxy coating on the exoskeleton, e.g. soap sprays and diatomaceous earth.<br>
 4. Fumigant gases that must be breathed in by the pest<br>
 5. Oils that suffocate small insects, e.g. a mixture of vegetable oils with dishwashing detergents.<br>
 4. Stomach poisons that must be eaten, e.g. rotenone and diatomaceous earth.<br>
 Pesticides used in schools<br>
The contents below are for information only and are not advice on how any agricultural chemical should be used in a school garden.<br>
Before using any agricultural chemical in a school garden, the supervisor should obtain advice from the Department of Agriculture and 
should obtain permission from the school principal.<br>
Safety of herbicides, weedicides, and pesticides<br>
Always store keep these chemicals in their original containers!<br>
In many countries, it is against the law to decant them into containers that had contained other substances, e.g. food or drink containers.<br>
A herbicide is a substance used to destroy plants or to slow down their growth.<br>
The formulation is the form in which the pesticide is supplied by the manufacturer for use.<br>
The half-life is the time required for half the amount of substance to be reduced by natural processes.<br>
The LC50 is the concentration in air, water, or food that will kill 50% of the subjects, usually laboratory rats.<br>
Mutagenicity is the ability to cause genetic changes.<br>
Non-target animals or plants other than those that the pesticide is intended to kill.<br>
Persistence is the tendency of a pesticide to remain active after it is applied to the pest or disease.<br>
Residual activity is the remaining amount of activity as a pesticide.<br>
Bees gathering nectar and pollen may be exposed to pesticides or they may carry contaminated pollen back to nests and hives and expose other bees to it.<br>
Copper (II) sulfate solution, dilute sulfuric acid and dinitro-o-cresol can each kill some weeds without causing injury to crops.<br>
S7 Poisons: Nemacur, Bifenthrin.<br>
S6 Poisons: Bromoxynil, Metaldehyde (100%), Hortico blackberry and tree killer, Warfarin, Pindone, Propoxur, Diazinon, Dichlorvos.<br>

Pesticide safety<br>
Only teachers are allowed to use pesticides.
1. Toxic means poisonous to humans.<br>
2. Safe pesticides: Mancozeb, Maneb, Methoxychlor, Quintozene, sulfur, Zineb.<br>
3. Fairly safe pesticides: Harmful, may cause sore eyes, nose, throat or skin, but there is not much danger if not touched or breathed in.<br>
4. Do not allow students to use Carbaryl, Malathion or Trichlorophon.<br>
5. Dangerous pesticides, toxic.<br>
If these pesticides are breathed in or left on the skin for some time, you may get sick and die.<br>
Only experienced teachers should use these poisons, e.g. Paraquat, Naled, Rotenone, Nicotine, Dimethoate, Methiocarb.<br>
Some pesticides are dangerous if swallowed, but not dangerous if left on the skin.<br>

If a person has drunk the pesticide, give an emetic to induce vomiting, but only if this is recommended on the insecticide container.<br>
A good emetic is 2 tablespoons of salt in warm water, then push the handle of the spoon gently on the back of the tongue.<br>
The person should be kept head down, face down.<br>
Give the person Ipecac syrup if it is available.<br>
Do not give the person alcohol.<br>
Pesticides on the skin should be washed off with plenty of soap and water, and keep washing for a long time.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.6.4H">4.6.4</a> Active constituent<br>
Pesticides are usually a mixture of chemicals.<br>
The chemical that kills the pest is called the active constituent.<br>
The other chemicals in the pesticide just make it easier to use and are called the inert ingredients.<br>
Some active constituents are inorganic compounds, e.g. copper oxychloride and some are organic compounds, compounds of carbon.<br>
An organic chloride compound contains a carbon compound and chlorine.<br>
An organic phosphate compound contains a carbon compound and phosphorus.<br>
The name of the active constituent is always written on the label.<br>
Pesticides are made by many different factories in different countries and each factory gives the pesticide its own special name, 
a trade name, e.g. Glyphosate weed spray: N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine, "Roundup", "Rodeo", "Accord", "Zero", S5 poison.<br>
So it is possible for pesticides with different trade names to contain the same active constituent and be used to kill the same pests.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.6.5H">4.6.5</a> Chemical pesticides, poisons<br>
None of the chemicals mentioned below should be used in school gardens.<br>
1. S7 Poisons, "Dangerous poison, highly toxic".<br>
Not to be taken.<br>
Keep out of reach of children.<br>
Must be stored in a locked poisons cupboard.<br>
Apply the chemical strictly in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions given on the label, product instruction sheet and the MSDS.<br>
Use MSDS to determine the Dangerous Goods Packing Group.<br>
Use chemical eye protection goggles eye and skin protection when splashes can occur or when spraying, e.g. Bayer Nemacur, Bifenthrin.<br>
2. S6 Poisons "Poison, moderately toxic".<br>
Not to be taken.<br>
Keep out of reach of children.<br>
Must be stored in a locked poisons cupboard.<br>
Apply the chemical strictly in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions given on the label, product instruction sheet and the MSDS.<br>
Use MSDS to determine the Dangerous Goods Packing Group.<br>
Use chemical eye protection goggles eye and skin protection when splashes can occur or when spraying, e.g. Bromoxynil, Diazinon, Dichlorvos, 
Hortico blackberry and tree killer, Metaldehyde (100%.), Pindone, Propoxur, Warfarin.<br>
3. S5 Poisons, "Caution, low toxicity".<br>
Apply the chemical strictly in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions given on the label, product instruction sheet and the MSDS.<br>
Use MSDS to determine whether the pesticide is a hazardous substance and / or a dangerous good.<br>
Use eye and skin protection when splashes can occur, e.g. Ametryn, Baysol snail and slug bait, Boric acid, Dicamba, MCPA, Pyrethrum, Pyrethrins, 
Yates Blitzem (snail bait), Zero weed spray (glyphosate).<br>
4. Unscheduled chemicals, "very low toxicity".<br>
Use in accordance with the safety instructions on the label, e.g. Lime sulfur spray fungicide, Dipel H G Bio-insecticide, white oil.<br>

<a href="../projects/ProjSchool.html#PlantprotectionH">Websites</a>, Plant protection, pests and diseases<br>
 | <a href="#4.0H">4.0</a> Agricultural chemicals<br>
Look at the crops ever day for signs of pests and diseases.<br>
Then be ready to decide what to do about the pests or diseases.<br>
The pest or disease may be harmless or does not do much damage, so either leave it alone or just pick off insects or diseased leaves by hand.<br>
If the pest or disease damages the crop so much that you will not get enough to eat from it, or you cannot sell it, then use pesticide sprays or dusts.<br>
Contact the agricultural field officer and ask for advice.<br>
Clean your spray pump and try it with water first.<br>
Check that you have enough of the right kind of spray.<br>
The only really safe pesticides to use in schools are made of garlic, tomato leaves, chillies, neem, soap, sulfur.<br>
Do not use commercial chemical sprays in schools.<br>
The teacher should do the spraying or supervise an older student very closely.<br>
Keep the students away from the spray.<br>
Do not spray on a windy day.<br>
Wash your hands and face, (using soap), after spraying.<br>
Clean out the sprayer after use so that you do not leave any pesticide in the sprayer.<br>
<br>
 The five methods of pest and disease control are as follows:<br>
 1. Use healthy planting material<br>
 2. Select resistant planting material<br>
 3. Good land preparation<br>
 4. Garden hygiene - burn any crop residues, weeds or useless plants<br>
 5. Sterilize soil for seed beds and boxes.<br>
 Seeds and cuttings should be clean and free of insects or disease spots.<br>
 Imported seeds in sealed silver packets will be free of disease.<br>
 Select planting material and seeds from plants known to be resistant to disease.<br>
 Prepare the land properly so the plants can grow well.<br>
 Dig the soil deeply and dig drains near by so the roots can grow strongly in the drained soil.<br>
 Fertilize the plants to provide enough plant nutrients.<br>
 Sick plants are damaged more by pests and diseases than healthy plants.<br>
 Dig out and burn all plants from the previous crop, weeds, and other stray plants, such as male papaya trees.<br>
 If you get rid of all unnecessary plants, then pests and diseases will not live on them ready to attack your crop.<br>
Soil for seed beds or seed boxes can be sterilized by heating the soil in an oil drum all day to kill pests and diseases.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.6.7H">4.6.7</a> Crop care<br>
Interplanting can help plants to help each other, so use a mixture of different kinds of plants in a garden, for example:<br>
| sweet potato | maize | sweet potato |maize | climbing bean | maize | pumpkin |<br>
If the same kinds of plants are separated from each other by other kinds of plants, it is harder for pests and disease to spread from one plant to plant.<br>
Some plants can help each other by shading weeds or repelling insects, e.g. marigolds will protect plants from nematode worms.<br>
Control by hand: Insects such as caterpillars, diseased plants and parts of plants can be removed by hand and burnt.<br>
Crops should be looked at every day for signs of pests and disease.<br>
Garden hygiene: Do not leave diseased plants in the garden - pull them all out and burn them.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.6.8H">4.6.8</a> Emulsifying agents<br>
An emulsifying agent is a chemical similar to soap that helps oil and water to mix and form an emulsion.<br>
When two liquids can mix they are called miscible.<br>
Wettable powders, (W.P.), are a mixture of an active constituent, e.g. sulfur, an emulsifying agent, and inert materials, e.g. clay.<br>
Water is mixed with the wettable powder to make a spray solution.<br>
Emulsifiable concentrates, (E.C.), are a mixture of active constituent, an emulsifying agent, and oil.<br>
Water is mixed with the emulsifiable concentrate, (E.C.), to make a spray solution.<br>
Emulsifiable concentrates and wettable powders should never be mixed together.<br>
The label on the pesticide gives information about which other pesticides can be mixed with it.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.6.9H">4.6.9</a> Fumigants<br>
Fumigants are poisonous gases used to kill pests in stored crops or soil.<br>
They are very dangerous and should not be used in schools.<br>
Some Departments of Agriculture use the dangerous poison ethylene dibromide on agricultural products that carry disease.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.6.10H">4.6.10</a> Granules<br>
Granules are very small pieces of rock with pesticides stuck to them.<br>
They are usually used when the pesticide has to be put in the soil.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.6.11H">4.6.11</a> Insect repellents<br>
<a href="../images/16.13.8chd.gif">See diagram 16.13.8</a>: Deet, DMP.<br>
Natural insect repellents contained strong smelling oils, e.g. citronella, that repel insects after contact with the repellent.<br>
The most effective insect repellents is deet, NN-diethyl-m-toluamide, C12H17NO.<br>
Also, DMP, dimethylphthalate, (C2H3O2)2C6H4, is an effective mosquito repellent, but it dissolves the plastic in watch glass and spectacles.<br>
Other effective repellents are E-Hex, ethyl hexanediol, and Indalone, butyl 3,4-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-4-oxo-2H-pyran-6-carboxylate!<br>
The best repellent for bush flies and sand flies is di-n-propyl isosinchomeronate with the addition of the pyrethrum synergist<br>
N-octyl bicycloheptenedicarboximide, NN diethyltoluamide, di-N-propyl isocinchomeronate.<br>
An attractant for pantry moth is "biolure", (2,E)-9,12-tetradien-1-yl acetate.<br>
Java oil contains geraniol and citronellal.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.6.12H">4.6.12</a> Integrated pest management, (IPM)<br>
Try to adopt an IPM approach to the control of pests on school farms.<br>
IPM is a process of selecting a range of control strategies and using them jointly in the removal of agricultural pests.<br>
Pest control methods that do not rely on the use of chemicals include the following:<br>
* Physical or mechanical control, e.g. hand picking, fly swats, mouse traps, fly screens, using light traps, using ultrasound, hand chipping of weeds.<br>
* Cultural or managerial control, e.g. farm hygiene, crop rotation, companion planting, adjusting time of planting / harvest, use of sealed storage.<br>
* Genetic control, e.g. the use of plants that are resistant to the pest.<br>
* Exclusion, e.g. fences to keep out rabbits, isolation of sick animals from a healthy herd, inspection of animals before allowing entry to a school farm.<br>
* Biological control, i.e. use organisms to reduce activities of pests, e.g. control of cabbage white butterfly with bacterium <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i>.<br>
Bt, <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i>, is a naturally occurring soil bacterium, an insecticide, which kills juvenile insects, mainly caterpillars and 
beetle larvae that consume it.<br>
The gene for Bt is used in GM, genetically modified, crops.<br>
Also, <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, suppresses the fungus <i>Alternaria helianthi</i> seedling blight of sunflowers<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.6.13H">4.6.13</a> The main pists of crops
1. Nematode worms or eel worms: They are small worms pointed at both ends and have S-shapes.<br>
They attack plant roots and may live in lumps on the roots.<br>
They attack papayas, tomatoes, and bananas.<br>
Killing nematodes or eel worms in the soil is very difficult.<br>
| Bulb and stem nematode <i>Ditylenchus dipsaci</i> on onions | Leaf nematodes <i>Aphelenchoides spp.</i>, on strawberries |<br>
2. Snails and slugs: Slugs are like snails with no shell.<br>
They eat plant leaves and stems.<br>
They can be controlled by picking off by students or by spraying with "Cuprox".<br>
3. Spiders: Tiny red spiders called mites attack the leaves of beans and eggplant.<br>
A chemical that kills them is called an acaricide, e.g. wettable sulfur.<br>
| Broad mite Polyphagotarsonemus latus on eggplants | Bulb mite <i>Rhizoglyphus echinopus</i> on garlic | Bunch mite <i>Brevipalpus lewisi</i> on grapes |<br 
4. Flies: Small white worms called larvae eat flowers and leaves, e.g. bean fly larvae.<br>
| Bean fly <i>Ophiomyia phaseoli</i> on French bean |<br.
5. Caterpillars: Some butterflies lay their eggs on the leaves and later caterpillars hatch out and eat the leaves.<br>
 They attack cabbages, tomatoes and beans.<br>
| Cabbage white butterfly <i>Pieris rapae</i> on cabbages |<br>
4. Mole crickets and grasshoppers: They attack Chinese cabbage and lettuce.<br>
| Black field cricket <i>Teleogryllus commodus</i> on pasture | Mole crickets <i>Gryllotalpa spp.</i> on vegetables |<br>
7. Beetles: Beetles have hard shiny outer wings
 | Pumpkin beetle <i>Aulacophora hilaris</i> on pumpkins | Rhinoceros beetle <i>Xylotrupes gideonon</i> on coconut palms |<br>
8. Bugs: Bugs have soft wings, e.g. vegetable bugs.<br>
| Golden mealybug <i>Nipaecoccus aurilanatus</i> on bunya pine |<br>
9. Rats: They eat root crops and fruit.<br>

Mancozeb, ethylene bisthiocarbamate, (EBDC), a dithiocarbamate, (C4H6N2S4Mn)x.Zny, (a combination of Maneb and Zineb), e.g. Pestanal, 
Dithane, protective fungicide, against many fungal diseases, including potato blight, leaf spot, downy mildew, and used for seed treatment of cereal grains.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.6.16H">4.6.16</a> Persistence<br>
Some pesticides and weedicides remain active for a long time, even in the soil.<br>
The time they remain active is called "persistence".<br>
Pesticides that persist for a long time may be dangerous, because their poisonous properties may affect later insects, animals and crops.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.6.17H">4.6.17</a> Resistance to pesticides<br>
It often happens that pesticides do not kill all the pests, because some get sick, but remain alive.<br>
Surviving pests may produce offspring which will not be affected by the pesticide, because they have developed resistance to this pesticide.<br>
So it is not wise to always use the same pesticide, but change the pesticides used from time to time.<br>
So when you use up all of one type of pesticide, try using another type of pesticide.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.6.18H">4.6.18</a> Surface-acting agents<br>
Surface acting agents are chemicals that may already be added to the pesticide or that can be added to the pesticide.<br>
They include detergents, soaps, wetting agents, spreaders and stickers.<br>
These chemicals spread the pesticide over the plants better and may make them stick to the plants.<br>
The label on the pesticide will tell you whether to mix with a surface active agent, a surfactant.<br>
There are many commercial surface active agents or use any washing detergent.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.6.19H">4.6.19</a> Synergists<br>
Synergists are chemicals added to pesticides to make them more poisonous, e.g. piperonyl butoxide makes the insecticide pyrethrum more poisonous.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.6.20H">4.6.20</a> W / V, W / W<br>
W / V This means weight per volume or the weight of active constituents in a certain volume of pesticide.<br>
So 30% W / V emulsifiable concentrate means 30 grams of active constituent in every 100 mL of the emulsifiable concentrate.<br>
This may also be written as 300 g / L (grams per litre).<br>
W / W means weight per weight or the weight of active constituents in a certain weight of pesticide.<br>
So a 50% W / W wettable powder means 50 grams of active constituent in every 100 grams of wettable powder.<br>
This may also be written as 500 g / kg (grams per kilogram).<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.6.21H">4.6.21</a> Withholding period<br>
This is the recommended time between spraying the crop and harvesting the crop, so that people will not be made sick

Make sure that crops that have been sprayed are not harvested within the withholding period.<br>
A sprayed crop must be washed thoroughly before being eaten.<br>

<a href="../biology/UNBiol8.html#AgrobacteriumH"><i>Agrobacterium</i></a><br>
 Nodules and galls are the result of growth stimulation by various agents: bacteria, viruses and insects.<br> 
 They may be beneficial, as are the root nodules caused by <i>Rhizobium</i>, a bacterium that fixes nitrogen when inside the root where a 
symbiotic association occurs.<br> 
 Some types are formed by parasitic associations, e.g. insect galls, or are pathological, e.g. sunflower gall and virus infections.<br> 
 Plants respond to the presence of the bacteria by producing auxins and kinins that are responsible for the abnormal cell division that lead to the swelling.<br> 
 Use young sunflower plants, half of which, about a week ago, received an inoculation of bacteria, <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i>, which cause galls.<br>

The sprays below may be used in school gardens.<br>
1. One cup vegetable oil to half a cup of water.<br>
2. Scale, aphids, smooth skinned caterpillars, mites and young grasshoppers suffocate when their bodies are covered with white oil.<br>
Oil sprays also deter the citrus leaf miner.<br>
In a blender, combine 2 cups of vegetable oil with a cup of dishwashing liquid.<br>
Blend it up until it is mixed well.<br>
Store this concentrate in a jar.<br>
Label it and include the dilution rate on the label.<br>
Dilute 1 tablespoon in a litre of water, mix it well and spray the pest as well as both sides of the foliage thoroughly.<br>
Always follow this dilution rate, because you can burn the foliage if it is too strong.<br>
Do not apply it in hot weather.<br>
Do not use it on plants with hairy foliage, ferns, palms and cycads as this can also cause leaf burn.<br>
Never use it on your trees in winter.<br>
3. Use 500 mL vegetable oil, 1 cup pure liquid soap, blend thoroughly in a mixer, store in a labelled jar in a cool place.<br>
For use, dilute 1 tablespoon (15 - 20 mL), of the mixture with 1 litre of water.<br>
Oil sprays can suffocate mites, scale insects and other small soft-bodied insects and deter leaf miners and small grasshoppers.<br>
The spray may not work on hairy leaves.<br>
Do not use the spray during very hot weather.<br>
4. Use 1 teaspoon (about 5 mL), liquid dishwashing detergent (as a wetting agent), 1 cup (about 200 mL) vegetable oil, 1 quart about 1 litre) tap water, 
for mites, aphids.<br>
It is a contact insecticide so it must contact all the insects.<br>
Test it first on small leaves, because it may cause leaf tip burn.<br>
Some gardeners prefer soap suds, using soft potassium soap, instead of dishwashing detergent.<br>
Some gardeners add ammonia or vinegar to attack scale insects.<br>
5. Use 2 cups vegetable oil + 1/4 cup of dishwashing detergent in blender for the concentrate, then use 1 tablespoon, (15 - 20 mL), to 1 litre of water.<br>
Spray both sides of leaves until all leaves are dripping wet.<br>
6. Use 160 mL dishwashing liquid + 15 mL glycerine in 4 L water.<br>
7. Use 4 parts vegetable oil, e.g. canola + 1 part dish-washing detergent, blend in electric blender until homogeneous, dilute 1:50 with water, spray from 
above and below.<br>
8. Use 750 mL canola oil + 45 mL detergent, e.g. "Sill" + 1, 250 mL water.<br>
9. Use 300 mL canola white oil + 300 mL vinegar + 300 mL water 4 + "Alginox" to kill algae, and spray during overcast weather or in the evening.<br>
10. Use commercial white oil for scale insects, aphids, smooth skinned caterpillars, mites, young grasshoppers, citrus leaf miner, mealy bugs, 
mites on roses, ornamentals, citrus, fruit trees.<br>
White oil contains petroleum distillates oil in dewaxed light paraffin emulsifiers.<br>
Spray white oil every 4 weeks.<br>
Do not store above 35oC.<br>
Do not use on citrus late autumn / winter and use not later than one day before edible harvest.<br>
Small insects suffocate when bodies are covered with white oil.<br>
However, white oil is more expensive than the above general contact sprays.<br>
11. Use 45 mL sodium bicarbonate + 35 ml white oil + 4.5 litres of water, spray weekly, saturate leaves to runoff: aphids, black spot, powdery mildew.<br>
12. Use 5 mL of cooking oil + 5 mL household detergent + 500 mL of water.<br>
Use the solution as a spray to control sooty mould.<br>
13. Use 4 mL of sunflower oil + 10 cc sodium bicarbonate + 1 drop household detergent + 1 litre of water.<br>

 <hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.7.6H">4.7.6</a> Sprayers and dusters<br>
 1. The chemicals used in agriculture may be applied as granules, dusts, or sprays.<br>
Granules are put into the soil, dusts are blown onto crops so do not need water.<br>
Granules can be spread by hand or you can buy a granule applicator or spreader.<br>
Sprays must be made up by mixing the chemical concentrate with water and sometimes a wetting agent.<br>
The cheapest dusters are the plunger type, which look like a bicycle pump.<br>
There are also larger and dearer rotary hand dusters.<br>
The simplest duster is made by cutting the bottom out of an opened fish tin and then put it in an old sock.<br>
2. The 3 types of sprayers:<br>
2.1 Slide action sprayers<br>
They are the cheapest.<br>
They are similar to the common fly spray.<br>
They contain up to 5 litres of spray.<br>
It is very tiring to use them for a long time.<br>
They do not control the pressure of the spray.<br>
These sprayers can be used in school kitchen gardens.<br>
2.2 Continuously pumped knapsack sprayers<br>
They are worn on the back or over the shoulder.<br>
They should give a continuous spray if you pump them slowly and evenly.<br>
They usually contain 10-15 litres of spray.<br>
They may be made of brass or plastic.<br>
Brass sprayers are tough, but heavy.<br>
Plastic sprayers are light, but can be damaged if dropped or left out in the sun.<br>
Plastic knapsack sprayers are the best type to use in school field gardens.<br>
2.3 Compression type sprayers<br>
After filling these sprayers, they are pumped up to a high pressure.<br>
Then they can be used without further pumping.<br>
These sprayers are probably too expensive for schools.<br>
3. Care and maintenance for a knapsack sprayer<br>
* Wash out the sprayer tank, hose and nozzle with clean water.<br>
* Clean the jet, which is the little hole at the end of the nozzle the spray passes through.<br>
Check that it is the right size for the job.<br>
Be very careful not to lose this little jet!<br>
* Read the instructions on the chemical container carefully, then measure out the amount of chemical you need for the job.<br>
* Add clean water to the sprayer until it is half full.<br>
* Put the measured amount of chemical into the sprayer, by using a graduated cylinder. and not guessing the amount of chemical concentrate.<br>
* Wash the chemical measure and put this water into the sprayer, then fill the sprayer with water.<br>
* Do not spray in the wind or rain.<br>
* When spraying walk evenly at about one pace each second to give each plant an even covering.<br>
* When finished, dig a hole in the bush and tip out all the unused spray into it.<br>
* Wash out the sprayer, hose and nozzle and tip all this water down the hole.<br>
* Remove the hose and nozzle then hang them upside down on the wall inside a lock up shed.<br>

 "Cyclodiene" pesticides, aldrin, chlordane, dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor<br>
Do not use "Cyclodiene" pesticides in school gardens.<br>
Chlordane, aldrin, dieldrin, heptachlor, endosulfan<br>
Hexachloropentadiene, C5Cl6 (Diels-Alder reaction) --> cyclodienes, e.g. aldrin C12H8Cl6, chlordane C10H6Cl8, dieldrin C12H8Cl6O, endrin C12H8Cl6O, endosulfan, C9H6Cl6O3S, heptachlor C10H6Cl7.<br>
These pesticides are now banned in most countries.<br>
They are broad spectrum insecticides, highly toxic to insects and mammals, and with high persistence.<br>
They also accumulate in body fats and act on the central nervous system.<br>
The compound may itself be non-toxic, but is converted to a toxic form in the body.<br>
They remain in the mammal body, measured as a half residence time, to be detoxified in the liver and excreted by the kidneys, leaving some stored in body<br>
fat to be released during illness, stress and lactation, maternal milk.<br>
Aldrin and dieldrin are active against insects by contact or ingestion.<br>
Their primary use was for the control of termites around buildings, corn pests by application to soil and in the citrus industry, termite proofing of plastic and 
rubber coverings of electrical and telecommunication.<br>
In 1970, the US Department of Agriculture cancelled all uses of aldrin and dieldrin based on the concern that these chemicals could cause severe aquatic 
environmental change and are potentially carcinogenic, so Aldrin and dieldrin have not been produced in the United States since 1974.<br>
Aldrin and dieldrin are classified as hazardous wastes that should be incinerated.<br>
Aldrin was used as a soil treatment, pre-planting, for crops, e.g. sugar cane, it was used in ant control as well as subterranean termite control, the protection 
 of power poles from termites, and domestic control of fleas, flies, lice and mites.<br>
Chlordane, dieldrin, aldrin and heptachlor, were marketed to complement DDT.<br>
Chlordane was used to control termites, various types of ants, borers, lawn beetles, curl grubs, cut worms and black beetles.<br>
Dieldrin was used against locusts and argentine ants, in the protection of electricity and telephone cable, soil treatment in farm and industrial premises for 
control of termites in buildings, fences and similar structures.<br>
Endosulfan was used widely to control insect pests, but is now banned or is being banned in most countries, because of its acute neurotoxic properties.<br>
Heptachlor, a persistent organic pollutant, was used similarly to chlordane, in soil treatment in crops for control of funnel ants and grubs of the grey-black 
beetle in cane growing areas, and banana beetle borer in banana plantations.<br>
In some countries it still has a limited use to control fire ants.<br>

Piperonyl butoxide, PBO, C19H30O5<br>
Synthetic pyrethroids contain natural pyrethrum with the synergist piperonyl butoxide, but these products are not allowed in some countries.<br>
DDT, methoxychlor, and pyrethrins are more efficient if piperonyl butoxide (PBO) is already added to the insecticide to give a synergistic effect.<br>
This additive is not itself an insecticide, but it deactivates enzymes for detoxification of the pesticide in the insect.<br>


<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.8.1H">4.8.1</a> DDT<br>
Safety: Do not use DDT in school gardens.<br>
<a href="topicIndexD.html#DDTH">DDT</a>, the new chemical name is 1,1-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-2,2,2-trichloroethane.<br>
The old name was dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, hence "DDT".<br>
DDT is a organochlorine contact insecticide that kills by acting as a nerve poison.<br>
It is a highly effective insecticide, and is of very low toxicity to mammals.<br>
It is odourless and tasteless, has a high persistence, and is chemically stable.<br>
However, insects can develop resistance to DDT by natural selection of surviving members with enzymes that can detoxify it.<br>
DDT and its metabolic breakdown product can accumulate in the fat of birds and fish, and even people, at the end of the food chain.<br>
It may cause birds to produce thin shell eggs that break easily.<br>
So the advantage of it being chemically stable is now seen as a major disadvantage.<br>
It was also used in large quantities in the control of mosquitoes, which caused malaria in tropical countries.<br>
There has been a total ban on the use of DDT in Australia since 1987.<br>
The technical product "DDT", which is a mixture of isomers, principally p,p'-DDT, with lesser amounts of o,p'-DDT.<br>
Once stored in fatty tissue, DDT residues are sequestrated and stabilized, unless they are mobilized either by lactation or great weight loss.<br>
They are all strongly suspected of being environmental endocrine disruptors, i.e. chemicals that affect the hormonal system.<br>

gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (γ-HCH), gammaxene, [wrongly-named, benzene hexachloride (BHC)], variant of hexachlorocyclohexane, (HCB).<br>
Lindane, is an insecticide with different names, made by the addition of chlorine to benzene.<br>
The 7-isomer is the insecticide of the nine isomers formed.<br>
The insecticide Lindane is more than 5-20 times more toxic to insects than DDT.<br>
Lindane, gamma-isomer of benzene hexachloride, is a a colourless crystalline solid with a slight musty odor that emits toxic fumes of hydrochloric acid and other chlorinated compounds when heated to decomposition.
Lindane is used as an insecticide for hardwood logs and a topical pediculicide and scabicide
Inhalation exposure to Lindane causes severe irritation of the nose and throat, and affects the liver, and other body systems.
 Lindane has not been produced in the United States since 1976, but is imported for insecticide use.
It was used for control of insect pests in stored seed, to control white grubs in pineapples, against ectoparasites on food.<br>
It was deregistered for general use in 1985.<br>
Generic Lindane is still available by prescription for head lice, but it appears that Lindane is not as effective against lice as it once was.<br>
Hexachlorobenzene has been used as a pesticide, but is no longer registered for this use in Australia.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.8.3H">4.8.3</a> Methoxychlor<br>
Safety: Do not use Methoxychlor in school gardens.<br>
<a href="Methoxychlor.png">See diagram</a> Methoxychlor<br>
Methoxychlor, C16H15Cl3O2, is an organochlorine insecticide.<br>
It is a contact and stomach poison, very safe to use, and has long persistence.<br>
Methoxychlor is pale yellow powder and has a fruity or musty odour.<br>
It is used to kill flies, mosquitoes, cockroaches, chiggers and others.<br>
Methoxychlor is a general insecticide for food crops, household pests, farm animals, pets and grain storage.<br>
It is available as wettable powder (W.P.), emulsifiable concentrate (E.C.), dusts, and in aerosol cans.<br>
It has oestrogenic effects on mammals.<br>
Methoxychlor is a biodegradable analogue of DDT.<br>
While non-polar compounds, e.g. DDT, stay dissolved in the fat of the body, polar substances, e.g. methoxychlor, are water soluble and can be excreted to<br>
be further attacked by other organisms.<br>
DDT and pyrethrins keep open the sodium channel of the insect nerve cell, but not the mammal nerve cell, so sodium ions leak in causing continuous<br>
transmission of nerve impulses.<br>
The insect dies of exhaustion and you can observe the frantic activity of house flies sprayed with DDT.<br>
When DDT sprays were introduced an advertisement stated "They fly outside to die".<br>
Methoxychlor can enter your body when you breathe contaminated air, eat contaminated food, get it on your skin and use garden products or pet sprays.<br>
High doses of methoxychlor could cause damage to the nervous system, but low levels of methoxychlor will leave the body so quickly that this type of damage is not likely.<br>
The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set a reference dose (RfD) for methoxychlor at 0.005 milligrams per day.<br>

Safety: Do not use organochlorine compounds in school gardens.<br>
1. The following organochlorine compounds have been banned in Australia and must not be used in schools:<br>
Aldrin, BHC, Chlordane, DDT, Dieldrin, Endrin, Heptachlor, Hexachlorophene, Isodrin, Lindane, Pentachlorophenol (PCP) C6HCl5O, 2,4,5-T.<br>
 2. The following pesticides are too dangerous for use in school food gardens:<br>
 2.1 Organochlorine compounds: DDT, benzene hexachloride (Lindane, gammexane BHC), aldrin (chlordane, dieldrin, heptachlor epoxide, endrin).<br>
Organochlorines are composed only of carbon, hydrogen and chlorine.<br>
They are biologically very active, but not easy to breakdown, hence persistent.<br>
They have one or more chlorine atoms attached to the carbon atoms, replacing hydrogen.<br>
The term "organochlorine" refers to a wide range of organic chemicals, which contain chlorine and sometimes several other elements.<br>
They have been used in Australia as herbicides, insecticides, fungicides and industrial chemicals, e.g. polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).<br>
They are very stable compounds that can be distributed in the environment, where they persist long after their original use.<br>
They degrade slowly and being fat soluble, accumulate in the food chain, eventually ending up in the fat of the human body.<br>
The key properties of organochlorines that cause concerns are persistence and toxicity.<br>
Organochlorine pesticides were manufactured for their toxicity.<br>
They were also persistent sp had advantages in that they remained effective against target pests for prolonged periods.<br>
They are used to protect crops, livestock, buildings and households from the damaging effects of insects.<br>
Commonly used organochlorine compound insecticides were DDT, Lindane, chlordane, dieldrin, aldrin and heptachlor.<br>
Fungicides included hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and chlorinated phenols, e.g. pentachlorophenol.<br>
Herbicide 2,4,5-T was also used.<br>
Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) was used in the past as a fungicide (seed disinfectant, seed paint), but is now banned in Australia.<br
Now it appears as a widespread contaminant in many environments.<br>
It was deregistered for general use between 1985 and 1987.<br>
Chlorinated phenols, e.g. pentachlorophenol (PCP) have been widely used in Australia to protect softwood timber from decay.<br>
Also, 2,4 5-T was used in the past as a herbicide against broad leaf woody plants, as a defoliant.<br>
The use of almost all the chemicals mentioned above is now banned in Australia.<br>
