Do not use acaricides in school gardens.<br>
Acaracides are used to kill red spider, mites and other 8-legged pests.<br>
1. <a name="DicofolH"></a>Dicofol, C14H9Cl5O, is a contact poison of mites only with long residual action, does not harm insects, is fairly safe, is not systemic, but may burn eggplant (aubergine), and other fruit.<br>
The withholding period is 7 days.<br>
Dicofol can control mites on citrus trees and red spider mite on passion fruit, banana, cassava and other crops, but Dimethoate is better.<br>
Highly inflammable, do not smoke near it.<br>
Dicofol is available as emulsifiable concentrate (E.C.), as wettable powder (W.P.), and as dusts.<br>
<a href="../images/16.13.5chd.gif">See diagram 16.13.5</a>: Dicofol.<br>

Lime sulfur, CaSx, can be used only by the teacher in school gardens.<br>
Lime sulfur, calcium polysulfide, lime sulfur, CaSx, orange-red, pH 10-12, [Ca(OH)2 + S], is an agricultural fungicide.<br>
It contains calcium and sulfur.<br>
It is a fungicide, acaricide and insecticide that is sprayed or dusted on plants.<br>
This is a hard spray to use properly, it can be dangerous to use and it causes skin irritation.<br>
It may burn leaves and metal.<br>
It can control many fungus diseases, e.g. leaf spots and powdery mildew and it can control red spider and mite and scale insects.<br>
It may damage plants in the pumpkin family.<br>
Lime sulfur is available as a solution or a powder.<br>
Use lime sulfur, CaSx to kill moss.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.3.2H">4.3.2</a> Potassium permanganate, Condy's crystals<br>

Sulfur, wettable sulfur can be used only by the teacher in school gardens.<br>
Avoid contact with eyes, skin and avoid breathing the vapour or dust.<br>
Wear appropriate protective clothing.<br>
It is a non-metallic element and is used as "Wettable sulfur".<br>
It is a fungicide and acaricide.<br>
It is safe to use, but it irritates the eyes and skin.<br>
It may damage leaves of plants in the pumpkin family.<br>
There is no withholding period.<br>
It can control mites on capsicums, citrus hibiscus cabbage and tomato.<br>
It can control powdery mildew, downy mildew and some rust diseases, but it is not effective for other fungus diseases.<br>
Sulfur is available as a dust, wettable powder and sulfur paste.<br>
Some people mix wettable sulfur with canola oil to make a spray.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.3.4H">4.3.4</a> "Yates Anti Rot Phosacid"<br>
Do not use Phosacid in school gardens.<br>
The phosphorous acid in "Yates Anti Rot" Phosacid inhibits the growth of fungus and enhances the defence system of plants.<br>
It breaks down in soil and does not harm the environment.<br>
It controls collar rot in citrus and ornamentals, root rot in citrus, avocados and ornamentals (including native plants, luculias, daphne and proteas) and downy mildew in grapes.<br>
It is sprayed over the foliage where it is absorbed into the plant.<br>
It has no withholding period, so it can be sprayed up to harvest.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.4.0H">4.4.0</a> Herbicides<br>
Herbicides, weedicides, commonly called weedkillers, are chemicals that are poisonous to plants and are used to kill unwanted plants.<br>
Some herbicides cause a range of health effects ranging from skin rashes to death.<br>
Herbicides should be used correctly and stored and disposed of safely.<br>
Dishwashing liquids contain surfactants (surface-acting agents) that may be added to herbicides to reduce the surface tension on the leaves of sprayed plants to allow the herbicide to stick evenly to the leaf surface and ensure maximum absorption.<br>
This process is valuable when spraying leaves with a wax or hair surface, because it stops formation of beads of weedicide apart from the leaf surface.<br>
However, some dishwashing liquids may neutralize the effect of the active ingredient of the weedicide by binding chemically with it.<br>
Also, dishwashing liquids may cause excessive foaming to damage spraying equipment.<br>
Non-ionic surfactants, "non-ionic wetters", are recommended to replace dishwashing liquids added to weedicides.<br>
If the weedicide already contains a "built-in" surfactant, there is no need to add more surfactants to the weedicide.<br>
Granular formulations of weedicide require the addition of non-ionic surfactants to work correctly.<br>
However, surfactants may be toxic to fish and frogs, but some "aquatic safe" herbicide formulations are commercially available.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.4.1H">4.4.1</a> weedicide, (2,4-D), (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid)<br>
Do not use 2,4-D in school gardens.<br>
<a href="../images/16.13.11chd.gif">See diagram 16.13.11</a>: 2, 4-D.<br>
(2,4-D), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, Cl2C6H3OCH2CO2H<br>
The phenoxyacetic acid herbicides are 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T and its precursor 2,4,5-trichlorophenol (TCP).<br>
The selective herbicide 2,4-D is toxic to broad leafed plants, but less harmful to grasses.<br>
This hormone weed killer 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid is an aryloxyalkanoic acid known also as a "phenoxy herbicide", including MCPA, mecoprop, triclopyr and 2,4,5-T.<br>
Their actions against weeds resembling those of auxins (growth hormones).<br>
Absorbed 2,4-D is translocated within the plant and accumulates at the growing points of roots and shoots where it inhibits growth.<br>
The principal use is for the control of broad leaf weeds in cereal crops, including wheat, maize, rice, sorghum, grassland and turf areas.<br>
It is also widely used in mixtures with other herbicides to provide weed control in forestry, orchards and non-crop areas, and aquatic weeds.<br>
2,4-D is a WHO Class II "moderately hazardous" pesticide, in the same class as endosulfan, lindane, paraquat and toxaphene.<br>
It has an LD50 of 375 mg / kg in rats with evidence suggesting a similar level of toxicity in humans.<br>
Occupational exposure to 2,4-D has produced serious eye and skin irritation, nausea, weakness and fatigue, and inflammation of nerve endings.<br>
The various chemical forms of 2,4-D can have different toxic effects.<br>
Orthocarboxylic acids, e.g. picloram, can behave in a similar manner and is more potent than 2,4-D.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.4.2H">4.4.2</a> weedicide, (2,4,5-T), (2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid)<br>
Do not use 2,4,5-T in school gardens.<br>
2,4,5-T plant growth regulator, Cl3C6H2OCH2CO2H<br>
(TCDD), 1,4,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, C12H4Cl4O2, (and other formulations)<br>
(2,4-D), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, Cl2C6H3OCH2CO2H<br>
<a href="../images/16.13.11chd.gif">See diagram 16.13.11</a>: 2,4,5-T.<br>
<a href="../appendices/appendixE.html#4.14.0H">4.14.0</a>: Dioxins, "Agent orange", PCBs:<br>
It was used to kill noxious weeds, e.g. privet and blackberry.<br>
At first it caused birth defects in animals and chloracne rash in workers due to a dioxin impurity TCDD (2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin), but this impurity can be controlled.<br>
Production of 2,4,5-T was contaminated with the carcinogenic dioxin TCDD.<br>
Agent Orange was used first by the UK military in Malaysia and later by the US military to defoliate jungle regions in Vietnam.<br>
Abnormal foetal skeletal development, increased foetal mortality and other reproductive effects may be associated with exposure to phenoxy-acid herbicide and their dioxin contaminants.<br>
2,4-D has low soil absorption and a high potential for leachability and 2,4-D residues have been recorded in groundwater and surface water.<br>
Some formulations of 2,4-D are highly toxic to fish.<br>
2,4,5-T,2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxyacetic acid, "Weedone", Acetic acid, (2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy)-555, C8H5Cl3O3.<br>
This herbicide was formerly used for industrial sites, lumber yards and vacant lots, range land and rice, lawns and turf, aquatic use, home use, recreation areas, food crops for humans.<br>
2,4,5-T is used post emergence alone or with 2,4-d for the control of shrubs and trees.<br>
It is also used for girdling, injection or cut stump treatment.<br>
It has been used as a growth regulator to increase size of citrus fruits and reduce excessive drop of deciduous fruit<br>
It has been used for weed control in lakes and ponds at 22-45 kg / ha, and along ditches and irrigation networks.<br>
The use of 2,4,5-T in the United States has been cancelled since 1985.<br>
It is odourless, but is an irritant to eyes, nose, and throat.<br>
The persistence of 2,4,5-T does not exceed one full growing season.<br>
Biodegradation of 2,4,5-T to 2,4,5-trichlorophenol appears to be the dominant removal mechanisms.<br>
2,4,5-T is was one of the most rapidly decomposed herbicides.<br>
2,4,5-T has been qualitatively identified in drinking water.<br>

<a href="../images/16.13.3chd.gif">See diagram: 16.13.3</a>: Dalapon.<br>
Dalapon is a herbicide that is used to kill grasses in many crops and drainage ditches.<br>
Dalapon Na is a selective poison that is taken in by the plant and moves through it to kill all parts, including the roots.<br>
It acts slowly over 2-3 weeks.<br>
It is safe to use, but causes irritation to the eyes and skin of some people.<br>
Dalapon can control most annual and perennial grasses, because it will kill every plant it touches.<br>
Dalapon is available as a water soluble powder.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.4.6H">4.4.6</a> Dinoseb<br>
Dinoseb should not be used in school gardens.<br>
Dinoseb, (2-sec-butyl-4, 6-dinitrophenol), C10H12N2O5, is a dinitrophenol fungicide and insecticide.<br>
It is used as a contact herbicide for post-emergence weed control in cereals, undersown cereals, seedling lucerne and peas.<br>
Dinoseb is also used as an insecticide and miticide.<br>
The use of dinoseb is banned in some countries, because it is known to cause birth defects and sterility if it gets into the drinking water.<br>
However, the EPA in USA determined that the 0.007 mg/L or 7 ppb MCLG and 0.007 mg/L or 7 ppb MCL for dinoseb are protective of human health.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.4.7H">4.4.7</a> DCMU<br>
DCMU should not be used in school gardens.<br>
DCMU, C9H10Cl2N2O, [(1,1-dimethyl,3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl) urea)], diuron, inhibits photosynthesis.<br>
It is a broad-spectrum residual herbicide and algicide used for pre-emergent and post-emergent control of both broadleaf and grass weeds in agriculture.<br>
It is used to control weeds in pineapples, sugarcane and cotton plantations.<br>
It is also used to control weeds and algae in and around water bodies and is a component of marine anti-fouling paints.<br>
The use of diuron on tropical crops, e.g. tea, coffee, and pawpaw is restricted in Australia.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.4.8H">4.4.8</a> Ethephon phosphonate, herbicide<br>
Ethephon, 2-chloroethylphosphonic acid, C2H6ClO3P, plant growth regulator, releases ethylene which affects ripening and maturation, and also stimulates the endogenous ethylene production.<br>
White crystalline powder, formulated as a soluble concentrate, is applied as foliar sprays.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.4.9H">4.4.9</a> Glyphosate, herbicide<br>
Only the teacher can use glyphosate in school gardens.<br>
However, based on a review of current research evidence, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, (IARC), an agency under WHO, upgraded the carcinogenic status of the herbicide glyphosate.<br>
Glyphosate, N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine (C3H8NO5P), (HO)2P(O)CH2NHCH2CO2H, "Roundup", "Rodeo", "Accord", "Zero"<br>
Glyphosate phosphonate, broad spectrum systemic herbicide, may be carcinogenic.<br>
<a href="../images/16.13.6chd.gif">See diagram: 16.13.6</a>: Glyphosate.<br>
1. Glyphosate, gives non-selective control of all grasses and broadleaf weeds, as well as onion weed, bamboo, lantana, blackberry and unwanted trees.<br>
It is used for economical and easy control of weeds when clearing garden beds before planting.<br>
It is non-residual.<br>
Use 200 mL of the concentrated formula to make up to 50 L of spray.<br>
It is absorbed by the foliage then translocated down to the roots to destroy roots and then the whole grass plant.<br>
The first signs after spraying are a gradual yellowing and wilting of the plant, then a complete browning of the entire weed and the death of the root.<br>
It is less effective if the weeds are not actively growing and the dry soil causes the stomata to close, poor leaf cover on weeds, e.g. waxy leaves, rainfall up to 6 hours after application, and if sprayed late in the afternoon.<br>
To allow translocation down to the roots and the chemical to take effect, the weeds should not be disturbed or cut after spraying.<br>
2. Commercial glyphosate products may contain inert ingredients, i.e. anything added to the product other than an active ingredient, e.g. glyphosate 41%, 
polyethoxylated tallow amine surfactant 15% and water 44%.<br>
It may contain the contaminant N-nitrosoglyphosate, (NNG).<br>
The registered use status is "General Use".<br>
It can control many difficult weeds, e.g. nut grass, couch grass, Johnson grass, <i>Sorghum halepense</i>, paspalum, kikuyu grass, blady grass, Guinea grass, purslane.<br>
It is used in forestry and noxious weed control to control grasses, herbaceous plants, but not all broadleaf woody plants.<br>
It is absorbed by leaves and prevents production of an essential amino acid and inhibits plant growth.<br>
It is broken down by some plants to mainly aminomethylphosphonic acid.<br>
Do not allow spray drift to contact desirable plants!<br>
It is safe to operators and has no residual activity in the soil, because glyphosate and the surfactants formulations are strongly adsorbed by soil.<br>
However, it remains unchanged in the soil, depending on soil texture and organic matter content, until soil micro-organisms break it down.<br>
Glyphosate and the surfactant are not absorbed from the soil by plants.<br>
It may be harmful to fish, but it does not build up, bioaccumulate, in fish.<br>
It is usually non-toxic to birds, mammals and bees.<br>
In tests in male and female rats, the acute oral LD50 was 4320 mg / kg.<br>
It does not cause genetic damage or birth defects, and no noticeable effect on fertility, reproduction, or development.<br>

<a href="../images/16.13.11chd.gif">See diagram 16.13.11</a>: MCPA.<br>
Phenoxyacetic acids can mimic the natural auxin, plant hormone, indole acetic acid and are not destroyed by the plant.<br>
They can also be used in setting unfertilized fruits and promoting root growth.<br>
When used in excess they can be used as herbicides.<br>
MCPA is used to kill dicotyledon weeds in monocotyledon cereal crops.<br>
Equal amounts are absorbed by weeds and cereals, but the cereals remain unharmed, because of the differences in their growing shoot structure.<br>

Do not use paraquat in school gardens.<br>
<a href="../images/16.13.6chd.gif">See diagram: 16.13.6</a>: Paraquat.<br>
 Paraquat, C12H14N2<sup>+2</sup>, is the trade name for N,N'-dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridinium chloride.<br>
 Paraquat is a poisonous dipyridilium compound used as contact herbicide.<br>
 Concentrated solutions of Paraquat causes irritation of the skin, cracking and shedding of the nails, and delayed healing of cuts and wounds.<br>
 It is a contact fast action poison.<br>
 Paraquat is a very dangerous chemical that can kill people if swallowed.<br>
 It is not poisonous after touching the clay in soils and there is no persistence in soil.<br>
 There should be a 9-day withholding period before harvest.<br>
 It controls most broad leaf annual weeds and grasses and works best when weeds are 2-15 cm high.<br>
 It is not very effective on perennials with good root systems.<br>
 It kills water weeds.<br>
 Keep livestock away when spraying Paraquat.<br>
 Paraquat is available as water solution.<br>
 Mix with water and immediately spray on leaves.<br>
 Paraquat, Diquat and Cyperquat are quaternary ammonium herbicides related to cationic surfactants that kill by contact with the plant foliage.<br>
 They cannot enter the plant via its roots, because they are very strongly adsorbed onto clay and soil particles.<br>
 They are used to kill weeds between crops or just before a crop emerges.<br>
 They are toxic to humans.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.5.1H">4.5.1</a> Inorganic chemical insecticides<br>
These chemicals are persistent stomach poisons that kill chewing insects, e.g. caterpillars, but not sucking insects, e.g. aphids, mosquitoes.<br>
Other inorganic chemicals are used as attractants, repellents and synergists.<br>
Inorganic insecticides are usually heavy metal compounds, particularly of lead, mercury, e.g. dimethyl mercury antifungal agent and insecticide, arsenic, antimony.<br>
Also, some are fluoride salts, e.g. NaF, sulfur, polysulfides and borax.<br>
1. Borax (Na2B4O7) is used as a cockroach and ant poison and is harmful to mammals.<br>
Do not use in school gardens.<br>
2. Copper chrome arsenate, (CCA), is used to treat timber, wood: <a href="../topics/topic12B.html#12.2.2.1H">12.2.2.1</a><br>
It is used to preserve fence posts and garden furniture giving a green colour.<br>
Such treated timber is safe for normal use, but the sawdust and smoke from burning may contain dangerous levels of arsenic.<br>
(However, the white powder seen on some newly purchased timber is probably harmless sodium sulfate.)<br>
Do not use in school gardens.<br>
3. Copper (II) sulfate and lime is used in Bordeaux mixture.<br>
Do not use Bordeaux mixture in school gardens.<br>
4. Lead arsenate, (PbHAsO4), is a heavy metal compound that is insoluble in water and so not readily absorbed by plants on contact.<br>
The lead blocks essential sites on enzymes and so it is non-specific.<br>
It is toxic to all living systems and extremely persistent.<br>
Do not use in school gardens.<br>
5. Sodium fluoride, (NaF), and cryolite, (Na3AlF6), liberate fluoride ions to precipitate Mg<sup>2+</sup> as fluorophosphate, thus affecting magnesium-dependent enzymes.<br>
It is non-specific and toxic to animals.<br>
Do not use in school gardens.<br>
6. Sulfur as elemental sulfur, S, and the soluble lime sulfur, (CaS), experiences aerial oxidation to SO2, to act as a safe fungicide and acaricide.<br>
It has some use as an insecticide.<br>
7. Petroleum oils, petroleum oil spray (PSO) are also "white oil", and "summer oil", and "winter oil" are poisonous to some scale insects.<br>
They are fairly safe to use, but there should be a one day withholding period, before harvest of the sprayed crop.<br>
The classification of petroleum oils is based on the temperature at which 5% of the constituents boil, e.g. C21, C23, C24 oils.<br>
The latter has less phytotoxicity.<br>
The oil droplets on the plant must all join together to kill all the insect pests.<br>
These oils are used in 2 ways:<br>
1. They can control scale insects, e.g. on citrus trees.<br>
2. They can be mixed with other insecticides, e.g. Carbaryl, to spread them better on the plants.<br>
Concentrations: 0.25% = 250 mL oil in 100 L water, 2% = 2 L oil in 100 L water.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.5.2H">4.5.2</a> Insecticide types, contact, ingestion, systemic<br>
Most insecticides kill insects by attacking the nervous system.<br>
These chemicals can also harm humans, especially children, so they must be used and stored with great care when used in school food gardens.<br>
Insects can take in insecticides in 3 ways:<br>
1. Contact poison<br>
The insecticide touches the body of the insect, which then absorbs it.<br>
2. Ingestion or stomach poisons<br>
The insecticide is sprayed onto plants and the insects eat the plants.<br>
3. Systemic poison<br>
The insecticide is sprayed onto plants that absorb it into the sap.<br>
Then sap-sucking insects suck up insecticide in the sap.<br>
However, most insecticides are taken in by more than one way.<br>
Insecticides may kill the good insects, e.g. bees and ladybirds, as well as the bad insects which eat the crops.<br>
So use insecticides only when the bad insects cannot be controlled in any other way.<br>
If the bad insects are not doing much damage to crops, then do not use insecticides.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.5.3H">4.5.3</a> Pyrethrin, Plant extract insecticide<br>
Safety: Safety gear should be worn when using pyrethrum.<br>
Follow the dilution rates suggested on product labels.<br>
Pyrethrin, Chrysanthemum monocarboxylic acid pyrethrolone ester, C21H28O3, is a yellow-brown liquid with distinct odour, that sinks in water.<br>
Pyrethrins are two almost identical organic compounds extracted from the pyrethrum flower <i>Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium</i>.<br>
Pyrethrins have an immediate knock down effect on flying insects, but a second poison may be needed to kill them.<br>
They have low toxicity to mammals.<br>
Allethrin insecticide is an organic compound that is the same as pyrethrin, but made in a factory.<br>
Permethrin is an organic compound that is similar to pyrethrin, but is made in a factory.<br>
Chilli, pyrethrin and permethrin are stomach poisons and contact insecticides.<br>
They are safe to use, but some people are made sick by them.<br>
They are not persistent and there is no withholding period.<br>
These poisons kill most pests quickly, so are called "knockdown sprays".<br>
They also repel insects, stopping them from coming near plants.<br>
They can kill such a wide range of insects that some people spray them only in the early evening when bees have returned to their hives.<br>

Rotenone, C23H22O6, polycyclic ketone, toxic, crystalline, odourless, colourless, crystalline, isoflavone, a rotenoid, piscicide, insecticide.<br>
It occurs in Lonchocarpus nicou, dried rhizome and root of Derris elliptica, Pachyrhizus erosus, jicama, also in many Fabaceae.<br>
Rotenone from derris dust, kills aphids, thrips, chewing insects, and is toxic to fish and birds.<br>
Rotenone is an organic compound obtained from roots of the legume Derris and other local bean plants.<br>
This chemical is a contact and stomach poison.<br>
Rotenone can be used to repel insects, control chewing insects and lawn grubs, and as an acaricide.<br>
It is toxic to earthworms and can also affect pigs.<br>
It is effective for short periods only, because it is broken down by oxygen and sunlight.<br>
It is not persistent and must be sprayed every three days.<br>
It does not store well.<br>
This is a good insecticide, but repeated applications are needed.<br>
If applied as "derris dust", the plant leaves must not be too shaded.<br>
Insects are never resistant to this poison.<br>
It can control beetles, weevils, slugs, looper caterpillars, thrips, flies.<br>
Rotenone is also used to poison fish.<br>
Rotenoids are natural substances, with a cis-fused tetrahydrochromeno [3,4-b] chromene nucleus, e.g. rotenone insecticide from Derris elliptica.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2">Caution before using pesticides<br>
1.0 Pesticides are chemicals that can kill pests.<br>
Insecticide kills insects, fungicide kills fungus and sometimes bacteria.<br>
Miticide or acaricide kills mites and spiders.<br>
Nematicide kills nematode worms.<br>
Molluscicide kills slugs and snails.<br>
Rodenticide kills mice and rats.<br>
Herbicide or weedicide kills weeds.<br>
2.0 Do not use any pesticides not mentioned in this chapter.<br>
All pesticides are dangerous to humans, especially children, so they must be used and stored with care if they are used in a school food gardens.<br>
Use pesticides only if there is no other way of saving your crop.<br>
If you want to use pesticides always tell the headmaster what you intend to do.<br>
3.0 The rules for using pesticides are as follows:<br>
*. Read the directions on the container before opening.<br>
Make sure that you have the right pesticide for the particular pest.<br>
Make sure that you understand how much pesticide to use.<br>
Make sure that your sprayer and tank is clean and working.<br>
Try it out with water first.<br>
*. Do not breathe in pesticide or spill it on your skin don't smoke or eat when using pesticides.<br>
If you spill pesticide on your skin, wash it off with plenty of soap and water straight away.<br>
*. Wear special protective clothing and wash yourself after spraying.<br>
Always handle concentrates with rubber gloves used only for that purpose.<br>
Wear a work shirt, buttoned down to the wrists, long trousers and boots.<br>
*. Spray on a calm day.<br>
*. After spraying, dig a hole in the bush and pour down it any makeup spray left in the tank.<br>
Wash out the sprayer and pump and pour the washing water down the hole.<br>
*. Store the unused pesticides in a safe place where children cannot enter.<br>
Always use the old container, do not store in a new container, e.g. a drink bottle.<br>
Do not store pesticides near food.<br>
*. The pesticide you will buy will often be in a concentrated form so you must follow a proper mixing procedure.<br>
Always use a plastic measuring cylinder or the special measure some pesticide factories make so you do not guess amounts of pesticide.<br>
Dusts are blown or sprinkled onto plants without using water.<br>
4.0 Mixing procedure for a liquid pesticide:<br>
* Fill sprayer tank half way with water.<br>
* Add measured amount of chemical to sprayer.<br>
* Fill sprayer tank with water.<br>
* Shake the sprayer.<br>
5. Mixing procedure for a powder pesticide:<br>
* Put small quantity of water in bucket.<br>
* Put measured quantity of pesticide powder on top of water, leave until it is thoroughly wetted and then mix into a paste.<br>
* Add water, then add to half filled knapsack as per instructions for liquid pesticides.<br>
 If this is not done, some wettable powder will go lumpy and give mixing problems.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.6.1H">4.6.1</a> Pesticides and herbicides safety<br>
 Pesticides are chemicals used for destroying insects or other organisms harmful to cultivated plants or to animals.<br>
 Pesticides may be harmful to humans and farm animals and should be used correctly and stored and disposed of safely.<br>
 Pesticides can be divided into the following:<br>
 1. Baits and traps, e.g. sticky tapes and glues, barrier paints, fruit fly traps, which may be indiscriminate and affect beneficial as well as harmful insects.<br>
 2. Contact poisons to be absorbed through the cuticle by spraying or by walking on sprayed fruit and leaves, e.g. pyrethrum, rotenone.<br>
 3. Desiccants that wear away the waxy exoskeleton or dissolve the waxy coating on the exoskeleton, e.g. soap sprays and diatomaceous earth.<br>
 4. Fumigant gases that must be breathed in by the pest<br>
 5. Oils that suffocate small insects, e.g. a mixture of vegetable oils with dishwashing detergents.<br>
 4. Stomach poisons that must be eaten, e.g. rotenone and diatomaceous earth.<br>
 Pesticides used in schools<br>
The contents below are for information only and are not advice on how any agricultural chemical should be used in a school garden.<br>
Before using any agricultural chemical in a school garden, the supervisor should obtain advice from the Department of Agriculture and should obtain permission from the school principal.<br>
Safety of herbicides, weedicides, and pesticides<br>
Always store keep these chemicals in their original containers!<br>
In many countries, it is against the law to decant them into containers that had contained other substances, e.g. food or drink containers.<br>
A herbicide is a substance used to destroy plants or to slow down their growth.<br>
The formulation is the form in which the pesticide is supplied by the manufacturer for use.<br>
The half-life is the time required for half the amount of substance to be reduced by natural processes.<br>
The LC50 is the concentration in air, water, or food that will kill 50% of the subjects, usually laboratory rats.<br>
Mutagenicity is the ability to cause genetic changes.<br>
Non-target animals or plants other than those that the pesticide is intended to kill.<br>
Persistence is the tendency of a pesticide to remain active after it is applied to the pest or disease.<br>
Residual activity is the remaining amount of activity as a pesticide.<br>
Bees gathering nectar and pollen may be exposed to pesticides or they may carry contaminated pollen back to nests and hives and expose other bees to it.<br>
Copper (II) sulfate solution, dilute sulfuric acid and dinitro-o-cresol can each kill some weeds without causing injury to crops.<br>
S7 Poisons: Nemacur, Bifenthrin.<br>
S6 Poisons: Bromoxynil, Metaldehyde (100%), Hortico blackberry and tree killer, Warfarin, Pindone, Propoxur, Diazinon, Dichlorvos.<br>

Only teachers are allowed to use pesticides.
1. Toxic means poisonous to humans.<br>
2. Safe pesticides: Mancozeb, Maneb, Methoxychlor, Quintozene, sulfur, Zineb.<br>
3. Fairly safe pesticides: Harmful, may cause sore eyes, nose, throat or skin, but there is not much danger if not touched or breathed in.<br>
4. Do not allow students to use Carbaryl, Malathion or Trichlorophon.<br>
5. Dangerous pesticides, toxic.<br>
If these pesticides are breathed in or left on the skin for some time, you may get sick and die.<br>
Only experienced teachers should use these poisons, e.g. Paraquat, Naled, Rotenone, Nicotine, Dimethoate, Methiocarb.<br>
Some pesticides are dangerous if swallowed, but not dangerous if left on the skin.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.6.3H">4.6.3</a> Pesticide safety, FIRST AID<br>
Any person who becomes ill after using a pesticide should be taken to a doctor or hospital without delay.<br>
Tell the doctor the name of the pesticide used, (active constituent), and show the container.<br>
The person who is sick from pesticide should be left to rest, clothing should be changed and the whole body washed.<br>
The person may need artificial respiration if breathing stops.<br>
If a person has drunk the pesticide, give an emetic to induce vomiting, but only if this is recommended on the insecticide container.<br>
A good emetic is 2 tablespoons of salt in warm water, then push the handle of the spoon gently on the back of the tongue.<br>
The person should be kept head down, face down.<br>
Give the person Ipecac syrup if it is available.<br>
Do not give the person alcohol.<br>
Pesticides on the skin should be washed off with plenty of soap and water, and keep washing for a long time.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.6.4H">4.6.4</a> Active constituent<br>
Pesticides are usually a mixture of chemicals.<br>
The chemical that kills the pest is called the active constituent.<br>
The other chemicals in the pesticide just make it easier to use and are called the inert ingredients.<br>
Some active constituents are inorganic compounds, e.g. copper oxychloride and some are organic compounds, compounds of carbon.<br>
An organic chloride compound contains a carbon compound and chlorine.<br>
An organic phosphate compound contains a carbon compound and phosphorus.<br>
The name of the active constituent is always written on the label.<br>
Pesticides are made by many different factories in different countries and each factory gives the pesticide its own special name, a trade name, e.g. Glyphosate weed spray: N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine, "Roundup", "Rodeo", "Accord", "Zero", S5 poison.<br>
So it is possible for pesticides with different trade names to contain the same active constituent and be used to kill the same pests.<br>

<a href="../projects/SchoolAgProjects.html#PlantprotectionH">Websites</a>, Plant protection, pests and diseases<br>
 | <a href="#4.0H">4.0</a> Agricultural chemicals<br>
Look at the crops ever day for signs of pests and diseases.<br>
Then be ready to decide what to do about the pests or diseases.<br>
The pest or disease may be harmless or does not do much damage, so either leave it alone or just pick off insects or diseased leaves by hand.<br>
If the pest or disease damages the crop so much that you will not get enough to eat from it, or you cannot sell it, then use pesticide sprays or dusts.<br>
Contact the agricultural field officer and ask for advice.<br>
Clean your spray pump and try it with water first.<br>
Check that you have enough of the right kind of spray.<br>
The only really safe pesticides to use in schools are made of garlic, tomato leaves, chillies, neem, soap, sulfur.<br>
Do not use commercial chemical sprays in schools.<br>
The teacher should do the spraying or supervise an older student very closely.<br>
Keep the students away from the spray.<br>
Do not spray on a windy day.<br>
Wash your hands and face, (using soap), after spraying.<br>
Clean out the sprayer after use so that you do not leave any pesticide in the sprayer.<br>
<br>
 The five methods of pest and disease control are as follows:<br>
 1. Use healthy planting material<br>
 2. Select resistant planting material<br>
 3. Good land preparation<br>
 4. Garden hygiene - burn any crop residues, weeds or useless plants<br>
 5. Sterilize soil for seed beds and boxes.<br>
 Seeds and cuttings should be clean and free of insects or disease spots.<br>
 Imported seeds in sealed silver packets will be free of disease.<br>
 Select planting material and seeds from plants known to be resistant to disease.<br>
 Prepare the land properly so the plants can grow well.<br>
 Dig the soil deeply and dig drains near by so the roots can grow strongly in the drained soil.<br>
 Fertilize the plants to provide enough plant nutrients.<br>
 Sick plants are damaged more by pests and diseases than healthy plants.<br>
 Dig out and burn all plants from the previous crop, weeds, and other stray plants, such as male papaya trees.<br>
 If you get rid of all unnecessary plants, then pests and diseases will not live on them ready to attack your crop.<br>
Soil for seed beds or seed boxes can be sterilized by heating the soil in an oil drum all day to kill pests and diseases.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.6.7H">4.6.7</a> Crop care<br>
Interplanting can help plants to help each other, so use a mixture of different kinds of plants in a garden, for example:<br>
| sweet potato | maize | sweet potato |maize | climbing bean | maize | pumpkin |<br>
If the same kinds of plants are separated from each other by other kinds of plants, it is harder for pests and disease to spread from one plant to plant.<br>
Some plants can help each other by shading weeds or repelling insects, e.g. marigolds will protect plants from nematode worms.<br>
Control by hand: Insects such as caterpillars, diseased plants and parts of plants can be removed by hand and burnt.<br>
Crops should be looked at every day for signs of pests and disease.<br>
Garden hygiene: Do not leave diseased plants in the garden - pull them all out and burn them.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.6.8H">4.6.8</a> Emulsifying agents<br>
An emulsifying agent is a chemical similar to soap that helps oil and water to mix and form an emulsion.<br>
When two liquids can mix they are called miscible.<br>
Wettable powders, (W.P.), are a mixture of an active constituent, e.g. sulfur, an emulsifying agent, and inert materials, e.g. clay.<br>
Water is mixed with the wettable powder to make a spray solution.<br>
Emulsifiable concentrates, (E.C.), are a mixture of active constituent, an emulsifying agent, and oil.<br>
Water is mixed with the emulsifiable concentrate, (E.C.), to make a spray solution.<br>
Emulsifiable concentrates and wettable powders should never be mixed together.<br>
The label on the pesticide gives information about which other pesticides can be mixed with it.<br>

Also, DMP, dimethylphthalate, (C2H3O2)2C6H4, is an effective mosquito repellent, but it dissolves the plastic in watch glass and spectacles.<br>
Other effective repellents are E-Hex, ethyl hexanediol, and Indalone, butyl 3,4-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-4-oxo-2H-pyran-6-carboxylate!<br>
The best repellent for bush flies and sand flies is di-n-propyl isosinchomeronate with the addition of the pyrethrum synergist<br>
N-octyl bicycloheptenedicarboximide, NN diethyltoluamide, di-N-propyl isocinchomeronate.<br>

Try to adopt an IPM approach to the control of pests on school farms.<br>
IPM is a process of selecting a range of control strategies and using them jointly in the removal of agricultural pests.<br>
Pest control methods that do not rely on the use of chemicals include the following:<br>
* Physical or mechanical control, e.g. hand picking, fly swats, mouse traps, fly screens, using light traps, using ultrasound, hand chipping of weeds.<br>
* Cultural or managerial control, e.g. farm hygiene, crop rotation, companion planting, adjusting time of planting / harvest, use of sealed storage.<br>
* Genetic control, e.g. the use of plants that are resistant to the pest.<br>
* Exclusion, e.g. fences to keep out rabbits, isolation of sick animals from a healthy herd, inspection of animals before allowing entry to a school farm.<br>
* Biological control, i.e. use organisms to reduce activities of pests, e.g. control of cabbage white butterfly with bacterium <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i>.<br>
Bt, <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i>, is a naturally occurring soil bacterium, an insecticide, which kills juvenile insects, mainly caterpillars and beetle larvae that consume it.<br>
The gene for Bt is used in GM, genetically modified, crops.<br>
Also, <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, suppresses the fungus <i>Alternaria helianthi</i> seedling blight of sunflowers<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.6.16H">4.6.16</a> Persistence<br>
Some pesticides and weedicides remain active for a long time, even in the soil.<br>
The time they remain active is called "persistence".<br>
Pesticides that persist for a long time may be dangerous, because their poisonous properties may affect later insects, animals and crops.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.6.17H">4.6.17</a> Resistance to pesticides<br>
It often happens that pesticides do not kill all the pests, because some get sick, but remain alive.<br>
Surviving pests may produce offspring which will not be affected by the pesticide, because they have developed resistance to this pesticide.<br>
So it is not wise to always use the same pesticide, but change the pesticides used from time to time.<br>
So when you use up all of one type of pesticide, try using another type of pesticide.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.6.18H">4.6.18</a> Surface-acting agents<br>
Surface acting agents are chemicals that may already be added to the pesticide or that can be added to the pesticide.<br>
They include detergents, soaps, wetting agents, spreaders and stickers.<br>
These chemicals spread the pesticide over the plants better and may make them stick to the plants.<br>
The label on the pesticide will tell you whether to mix with a surface active agent, a surfactant.<br>
There are many commercial surface active agents or use any washing detergent.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.6.19H">4.6.19</a> Synergists<br>
Synergists are chemicals added to pesticides to make them more poisonous, e.g. piperonyl butoxide makes the insecticide pyrethrum more poisonous.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.6.20H>4.6.20</a> W / V, W / W<br>
W / V This means weight per volume or the weight of active constituents in a certain volume of pesticide.<br>
So 30% W / V emulsifiable concentrate means 30 grams of active constituent in every 100 mL of the emulsifiable concentrate.<br>
This may also be written as 300 g / L (grams per litre).<br>
W / W means weight per weight or the weight of active constituents in a certain weight of pesticide.<br>
So a 50% W / W wettable powder means 50 grams of active constituent in every 100 grams of wettable powder.<br>
This may also be written as 500 g / kg (grams per kilogram).<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.6.21H">4.6.21</a> Withholding period<br>
This is the recommended time between spraying the crop and harvesting the crop, so that people will not be made sick by eating any pesticide remaining on the plants.<br>
Make sure that crops that have been sprayed are not harvested within the withholding period.<br>
A sprayed crop must be washed thoroughly before being eaten.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.7.5H">4.75</a> Sprayers and dusters<br>
 1. The chemicals used in agriculture may be applied as granules, dusts, or sprays.<br>
Granules are put into the soil, dusts are blown onto crops so do not need water.<br>
Granules can be spread by hand or you can buy a granule applicator or spreader.<br>
Sprays must be made up by mixing the chemical concentrate with water and sometimes a wetting agent.<br>
The cheapest dusters are the plunger type, which look like a bicycle pump.<br>
There are also larger and dearer rotary hand dusters.<br>
The simplest duster is made by cutting the bottom out of an opened fish tin and then put it in an old sock.<br>
2. The 3 types of sprayers:<br>
2.1 Slide action sprayers<br>
They are the cheapest.<br>
They are similar to the common fly spray.<br>
They contain up to 5 litres of spray.<br>
It is very tiring to use them for a long time.<br>
They do not control the pressure of the spray.<br>
These sprayers can be used in school kitchen gardens.<br>
2.2 Continuously pumped knapsack sprayers<br>
They are worn on the back or over the shoulder.<br>
They should give a continuous spray if you pump them slowly and evenly.<br>
They usually contain 10-15 litres of spray.<br>
They may be made of brass or plastic.<br>
Brass sprayers are tough, but heavy.<br>
Plastic sprayers are light, but can be damaged if dropped or left out in the sun.<br>
Plastic knapsack sprayers are the best type to use in school field gardens.<br>
2.3 Compression type sprayers<br>
After filling these sprayers, they are pumped up to a high pressure.<br>
Then they can be used without further pumping.<br>
These sprayers are probably too expensive for schools.<br>
3. Care and maintenance for a knapsack sprayer<br>
* Wash out the sprayer tank, hose and nozzle with clean water.<br>
* Clean the jet, which is the little hole at the end of the nozzle the spray passes through.<br>
Check that it is the right size for the job.<br>
Be very careful not to lose this little jet!<br>
* Read the instructions on the chemical container carefully, then measure out the amount of chemical you need for the job.<br>
* Add clean water to the sprayer until it is half full.<br>
* Put the measured amount of chemical into the sprayer, by using a graduated cylinder. and not guessing the amount of chemical concentrate.<br>
* Wash the chemical measure and put this water into the sprayer, then fill the sprayer with water.<br>
* Do not spray in the wind or rain.<br>
* When spraying walk evenly at about one pace each second to give each plant an even covering.<br>
* When finished, dig a hole in the bush and tip out all the unused spray into it.<br>
* Wash out the sprayer, hose and nozzle and tip all this water down the hole.<br>
* Remove the hose and nozzle then hang them upside down on the wall inside a lock up shed.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.7.6H">4.7.6</a> Oil sprays<br>
The sprays below may be used in school gardens.<br>
1. One cup vegetable oil to half a cup of water.<br>
2. Scale, aphids, smooth skinned caterpillars, mites and young grasshoppers suffocate when their bodies are covered with white oil.<br>
Oil sprays also deter the citrus leaf miner.<br>
In a blender, combine 2 cups of vegetable oil with a cup of dishwashing liquid.<br>
Blend it up until it is mixed well.<br>
Store this concentrate in a jar.<br>
Label it and include the dilution rate on the label.<br>
Dilute 1 tablespoon in a litre of water, mix it well and spray the pest as well as both sides of the foliage thoroughly.<br>
Always follow this dilution rate, because you can burn the foliage if it is too strong.<br>
Do not apply it in hot weather.<br>
Do not use it on plants with hairy foliage, ferns, palms and cycads as this can also cause leaf burn.<br>
Never use it on your trees in winter.<br>
3. Use 500 mL vegetable oil, 1 cup pure liquid soap, blend thoroughly in a mixer, store in a labelled jar in a cool place.<br>
For use, dilute 1 tablespoon (15 - 20 mL), of the mixture with 1 litre of water.<br>
Oil sprays can suffocate mites, scale insects and other small soft-bodied insects and deter leaf miners and small grasshoppers.<br>
The spray may not work on hairy leaves.<br>
Do not use the spray during very hot weather.<br>
4. Use 1 teaspoon (about 5 mL), liquid dishwashing detergent (as a wetting agent), 1 cup (about 200 mL) vegetable oil, 1 quart about 1 litre) tap water, for mites, aphids.<br>
It is a contact insecticide so it must contact all the insects.<br>
Test it first on small leaves, because it may cause leaf tip burn.<br>
Some gardeners prefer soap suds, using soft potassium soap, instead of dishwashing detergent.<br>
Some gardeners add ammonia or vinegar to attack scale insects.<br>
5. Use 2 cups vegetable oil + 1/4 cup of dishwashing detergent in blender for the concentrate, then use 1 tablespoon, (15 - 20 mL), to 1 litre of water.<br>
Spray both sides of leaves until all leaves are dripping wet.<br>
6. Use 160 mL dishwashing liquid + 15 mL glycerine in 4 L water.<br>
7. Use 4 parts vegetable oil, e.g. canola + 1 part dish-washing detergent, blend in electric blender until homogeneous, dilute 1:50 with water, spray from above and below.<br>
8. Use 750 mL canola oil + 45 mL detergent, e.g. "Sill" + 1, 250 mL water.<br>
9. Use 300 mL canola white oil + 300 mL vinegar + 300 mL water 4 + "Alginox" to kill algae, and spray during overcast weather or in the evening.<br>
10. Use commercial white oil for scale insects, aphids, smooth skinned caterpillars, mites, young grasshoppers, citrus leaf miner, mealy bugs, mites on roses, ornamentals, citrus, fruit trees.<br>
White oil contains petroleum distillates oil in dewaxed light paraffin emulsifiers.<br>
Spray white oil every 4 weeks.<br>
Do not store above 35<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
Do not use on citrus late autumn / winter and use not later than one day before edible harvest.<br>
Small insects suffocate when bodies are covered with white oil.<br>
However, white oil is more expensive than the above general contact sprays.<br>
11. Use 45 mL sodium bicarbonate + 35 ml white oil + 4.5 litres of water, spray weekly, saturate leaves to runoff: aphids, black spot, powdery mildew.<br>
12. Use 5 mL of cooking oil + 5 mL household detergent + 500 mL of water.<br>
Use the solution as a spray to control sooty mould.<br>
13. Use 4 mL of sunflower oil + 10 cc sodium bicarbonate + 1 drop household detergent + 1 litre of water.<br>
Use the solution as a spray to control black spot on roses.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.8.0H">4.8.0</a> Insect pests collection<br>
 Before starting to teach this and the next lesson, make a collection of pests and diseases from your garden.<br>
 They can usually be preserved in methylated spirits.<br>
 Also, collect diagrams of different pests.<br>
 Make sure that your garden is a good example of pest and disease control.<br>
 Check your spray equipment and pesticides.<br>
 A field visit may be useful for this lesson.<br>
 Show the students the examples of pests and diseases that you have collected from the garden.<br>
 To obtain the greatest possible production and cash income from your crops you must control loss by pests and diseases.<br>
 Pests are animals that eat your crops or infect your crop plants with diseases.<br>
 Pests may live in the ground, be attached to infected plants or may fly or walk to your crop.<br>
 Diseases are any change in the plant such as spots or holes in the leaves, wilting of the plant, rotting of the living plant.<br>
 They are caused by living things that may be so small that they cannot usually be seen by eye.<br>
 Diseases are carried by wind and water, infected plants, and pests.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.8.1H">4.8.1</a> The main pests of crops:<br>
1. Nematode worms or eel worms: They are small worms pointed at both ends and have S-shapes.<br>
They attack plant roots and may live in lumps on the roots.<br>
They attack papayas, tomatoes, and bananas.<br>
Killing nematodes or eel worms in the soil is very difficult.<br>
| Bulb and stem nematode <i>Ditylenchus dipsaci</i> on onions | Leaf nematodes <i>Aphelenchoides spp.</i>, on strawberries |<br>
2. Snails and slugs: Slugs are like snails with no shell.<br>
They eat plant leaves and stems.<br>
They can be controlled by picking off by students or by spraying with "Cuprox".<br>
3. Spiders: Tiny red spiders called mites attack the leaves of beans and eggplant.<br>
A chemical that kills them is called an acaricide, e.g. wettable sulfur.<br>
| Broad mite Polyphagotarsonemus latus on eggplants | Bulb mite <i>Rhizoglyphus echinopus</i> on garlic | Bunch mite <i>Brevipalpus lewisi</i> on grapes |<br 
4. Flies: Small white worms called larvae eat flowers and leaves, e.g. bean fly larvae.<br>
| Bean fly <i>Ophiomyia phaseoli</i> on French bean |<br.
5. Caterpillars: Some butterflies lay their eggs on the leaves and later caterpillars hatch out and eat the leaves.<br>
 They attack cabbages, tomatoes and beans.<br>
| Cabbage white butterfly <i>Pieris rapae</i> on cabbages |<br>
4. Mole crickets and grasshoppers: They attack Chinese cabbage and lettuce.<br>
| Black field cricket <i>Teleogryllus commodus</i> on pasture | Mole crickets <i>Gryllotalpa spp.</i> on vegetables |<br>
7. Beetles: Beetles have hard shiny outer wings
 | Pumpkin beetle <i>Aulacophora hilaris</i> on pumpkins | Rhinoceros beetle <i>Xylotrupes gideonon</i> on coconut palms |<br>
8. Bugs: Bugs have soft wings, e.g. vegetable bugs.<br>

It sucks nutrients from phloem or lower leaf surfaces leaving chlorotic spots and withered leaves.<br>
It produce a sticky substance, "honeydew", on which sooty moulds can grow, which reduce light to plant.<br>
It is also vector for plant diseases, e.g. lettuce yellows virus, tomato yellow leaf curl virus, African cassava mosaic, and cassava brown streak virus.<br>

 | <a href="../biology/UNBiology8.html#9.0.0H">9.0.0</a> Fungi<br>
Fungi can attack and digest green plants, and may live in the damp soil.<br>
 Leaf and stem fungus diseases appear as yellow or brown spots that may later join, then the leaf or stem dies.<br>
Chemicals that kill fungi are called fungicides, e.g. "Captan".<br>
<a name="DampingoffH"></a>Damping-off diseases<br>
When seeds or seedlings are attacked by fungi or bacteria which live in the soil, the plant disease is called pre-emergence damping-off.<br>
If the attack occurs after the seedling has appeared above the ground, the plant disease id called post-emergence damping-off.<br>
The rot occurs at the base of the stem or in the roots and spreads upwards into the lower stem.<br>
Damping off fungus disease attacks germinating seeds and makes all the seedlings fall over and die.<br>
The fungi <i>Pythium spp.</i> and <i>Phytophthora spp.</i> commonly cause damping-off.<br>
The fungus <i>Rhizoctinia spp.</i> may cause only the outer areas of the stem to rot, a condition called "wire-stem".<br>
If fungi grow up the stems of seedlings to infect the leaves, brown threads appear where the <i>Rhizoctinia spp.</i> touch the soil.<br>
Damping-off fungi can be avoided by making sure seedlings are not over- watered, overcrowded, damaged, or in a poorly drained medium.<br>
Damping-off can be prevented by heating the soil to kill all the fungi before planting seeds - soil sterilization.<br>
<a name="CollarrotH"></a>Collar rot diseases<br>
Collar rot fungus disease attacks the stem near the ground, usually at an early stage of growth.<br>
It may cause sunken areas near the ground on the young stems, soil particles sticking to threads in the sunken areas and wilting foliage.<br>
Although collar rots may be called "rhizoctonia disease", on beans, other fungi, e.g. <i>Phytophthora</i>, and bacteria can cause collar rots.<br>
Collar rots on trees, e.g. <i> Citrus spp.</i> may cause gum oozing out of the bark near the ground.<br>
If this barks becomes brittle, it may indicate infection occurring around the stem, leading to ringbarking of the tree.<br>
<a name="PowderymildewsH"></a>Powdery mildews diseases<br>
Powdery mildews are first seen as faint white spots on leaves which increase in area until the whole leaf, or buds and fruit, are covered with a white powder.<br>
Infected young leaves become distorted and fold, but not infected mature leaves.<br>
Powdery mildew spores germinate during high humidity weather, rather than during rainy weather.<br>
Powdery mildew looks like white threads on leaves or stems of pumpkins and cucumbers, criss-cross lines on red apples.<br>
Powdery mildews may occur on grapes, papaya, strawberries.<br>
<a name="RustsdiseasesH"></a>Rusts diseases<br>
Rusts diseases cause yellow spots on the upper surfaces of leaves and may be caused by many different fungi.<br>
Some rusts stimulate the plant to form galls characteristic of that species of fungi.<br>
Rusts occur on beans, carnations, chrysanthemums, geraniums, peach, raspberry and many grasses.<br>
Wheat leaf rust (Puccinia triticina) spends part of its life cycle on wheat, <i> Triticum aestivum</i>, and part on barberry plants <i>Berberis spp.</i>.<br>

Bacterial diseases include bacterial black spot of mangos, bacterial blight on mulberry trees and pea, bacterial brown spot of bean, bacterial canker of cherries and apricots, and bacterial canker on tomatoes.<br>
These diseases cannot usually be cured, but they can be prevented by soaking seeds in very hot water for a short time.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.9.3H">4.9.3</a> Virus diseases of plants<br>
<a href="../biology/UNBiology9.html#9.0H">Viruses</a><br>
Viruses may cause yellow patches on leaves and later the plant dies, e.g. in taro and bananas.<br>
These diseases cannot be cured, but if the virus is carried by insects they may be controlled.<br>
The best way to deal with bacterial or virus diseases is to burn the infected plant or part of the plant.<br>
Diseases are carried to plants in four ways:<br>
1. Wind can carry diseases a short distance.<br>
2. Disease can be carried in running water or in the splash of rain drops.<br>
3. Infected plants can pass disease to healthy plants if the plants are touching.<br>
4. Disease can be carried by insect pests that can then infect healthy plants.<br>
Virus diseases include apple mosaic, clover stunt and cymbidium virus of orchids.<br>
Yellow crinkle of papaya and big bud of tomatoes are caused by mycoplasma-like organisms (phytoplasmas).<br>
