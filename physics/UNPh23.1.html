<a href="../images/23.8.7.gif">See diagram 23.8.7</a>: Shiny cans and black cans.<br>
 1. To compare the influences of surfaces with different quality and colour in emitting and absorbing thermal radiation use three empty flat cans.<br>
 Remove their caps and clean them then dry them.<br>
 Paint their insides with white lacquer and outsides with black lacquer and white quicklime solution uniformly.<br>
 Choosing bright lacquers to paint them is better and do not paint the second layer of lacquer until the first one is fully dry.<br>
 Use a piece of white foam board for packing instruments.<br>
 Make three caps and pads for the three cans with the board.<br>
 Insert a thermometer into each cap.<br>
 Fill the 3 tin cans with the same volume of cold water.<br>
 Cover the cap on each can and put the pad under each can.<br>
 Place each can with the cap and the pad in the sunlight far from each another.<br>
 Record the original temperatures.<br>
 Then record their temperatures every 5 to 15 minutes.<br>
 Draw a temperature time curve with the 5 groups of data recorded.<br>
 The ideal distance between the bulb and cans is where your hand feels the heat from the bulb.<br>
 Repeat the experiment with hot water more than 80<sup>o</sup>C and in a cool room.<br>
 Record the temperatures.<br>
 2. Use three same size metal drink-cans.<br>
 Paint the first can white.<br>
 Paint the second can black.<br>
 Let the third metal drink-can remain shiny.<br>
 Fill the cans to the same level with warm water at the same temperature.<br>
 Record the initial temperature.<br>
 Put cardboard covers with holes for thermometers over each can.<br>
 Put cans in a cool place.<br>
 Record the temperature of the water in each can at five minute intervals.<br>
 Describe the difference in the rate of cooling.<br>
 The second can cools fastest, because a black surface is the best radiator of heat.<br>
 3. Use a metal with width greater than a 100 W incandescent light bulb.<br>
 Paint one half of the inside of the can black.<br>
 Leave the other half shiny.<br>
 Put two blobs of petroleum jelly on opposite sides of the outside of the can.<br>
 Put one opposite the middle of the black interior and the other opposite the middle of the shiny interior.<br>
 Stick two coins on the blobs of petroleum jelly.<br>
 Fix a 100 watt light globe over the middle of the can and turn on the light.<br>
 The coin nearest the black interior falls first, because its blob of petroleum jelly melts first.<br>
 4. Wear a pair of old shoes.<br>
 Paint the left shoe black and the right shoe white.<br>
 Your left foot becomes your hot foot.<br>
 5. Wear a dark coloured sleeve and a light coloured sleeve of the same weave.<br>
Your arm in the dark-coloured sleeve feels warmer.<br>
 If one sleeve is made of loosely woven material. it has many air spaces compared with a tightly woven material. and air is a heat insulator.<br>
<a href="../images/Bichsel.jpg">See diagram</a>: Bichsel boxes.<br>
A "black body" is a hypothetical perfect absorber and radiator of electromagnetic radiation.<br>
Holes in black boxes are blacker than the boxes themselves, even though one box is painted white on the inside.<br>
A box with a black interior and another box with a white interior show that the radiation coming from a cavity is determined by the temperature inside the cavity.<br>
The two holes appear equally dark. although the inside of one box is painted white and the other is painted black.<br>
So the radiation emerging from the holes is a function only of temperature.<br>
Bichsel boxes demonstrates Wien's law of radiation:<br>
The density energy of radiation Uv. which corresponds to the frequency of radiation v. depends on v and the absolute temperature T.<br>
Bichsel boxes<br>
1. A light tight box has two small identical holes in one face.<br>
One of the holes is backed by a black piece of paper.<br>
The other hole has no backing and appears much darker.<br>
Open the box to show that the inside is painted white.<br>
An ideal black surface absorbs. rather than reflects. all radiation that hits it.<br>
If the hole in the box is small enough. most radiation that hits the hole enters the box. bounces around the box. most getting absorbed on each bounce, and never leaves the box through the hole.<br>
So the hole is perfectly black.<br>
The small hole also emits radiation. with a spectral distribution of frequencies that depends only on the temperature of the walls of the box.<br>
The description of this radiation led directly to the discovery of quantum theory.<br>
2. Two identical boxes are painted black on the outside, can be opened or closed, and have an identical small hole in the middle of the wall.<br>
One box is painted black inside and the other box is painted white inside.<br>
For both boxes, the holes appear blacker than the outside wall of the boxes.<br>
This observation demonstrates that the radiation coming from a cavity is determined by the temperature inside the cavity.<br>
 3. A light tight oven with a tiny hole in the side. emits "cavity radiation" through the hole.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="23.8.4H">23.8.4</a> Colour temperature<br>
Colour temperature is a measurement in degrees Kelvin that indicates the hue of a light source.<br>
The colour temperature of a light source is the temperature of an ideal black body radiator that radiates light of comparable hue to the light source.<br>
Colour temperatures over 5,000 K are called cool colours (bluish white) and lower colour temperatures (2000 K) are called warm colours, (yellow-white to red).<br>
Within visible light, the shorter the wavelength the higher the colour temperature.<br>
The hottest stars radiate blue (cool) light, and the coolest radiate red (warm) light.<br>
 Approximate ranges of colour temperature:<br>
Infrared, candle 1800 K. tungsten incandescent bulb 2800 K. tungsten-halogen bulb (quartz bulb) 3200 K.<br>
 fluorescent lamp 4500 K. noon sunlight 5800 K. clear sky light 27,000-30,000 K, Ultraviolet<br>
 Trade descriptions used by the "Light Bulbs Direct" company:<br>
 Colour Temperature. "Designation". Application<br>
 2700 "Extra Warm White": Similar light to normal incandescent bulbs, giving a warm cosy feel.<br>
 3000 "Warm White": The colour of most halogen lamps.<br>
 Appears slightly "whiter" than ordinary incandescent lamps.<br>
 3500 "White": The standard colour for many fluorescent and compact fluorescent tubes.<br>
 4000 "Cool White": Gives a more clinical or high tech feel.<br>
 6000 "Daylight": Fluorescent or compact fluorescent lamps simulating natural daylight.<br>
 6500 "Cool Daylight": Extremely white light used in specialist daylight lamps.<br>

2. Fill the same metal drink-cans with very cold water and record the initial temperature.<br>
 Put cardboard covers with holes for thermometers over each can.<br>
 Put the cans in a warm place in the sun.<br>
 Record the temperature of the water at five minute intervals.<br>
 The black metal drink-can is the best absorber of heat.<br>

 The heat could not reach your hand so quickly by conduction, because  air is a very poor conductor of heat.<br>
 The heat could not reach your hand so quickly by convection, because convection carries the heat upward and away from your hand.<br>
 The heat came to your hand carried by short electromagnetic waves of wavelengths longer than light.<br>

1. Use a magnifying glass to focus the rays of the sun on a piece of  paper tissue.<br>
 Observe that the tissue paper chars. then catches fire from the focussed  heat rays.<br>
2. Repeat the experiment with tissue paper blackened  with Indian ink or soot.<br>
 The blackened tissue paper catches fire sooner than the white paper  in the previous experiment.<br>
3. Focus the sun's rays on your arm.<br>
 A bright spot forms and you can feel the hot spot.<br>
 Note the distance of the lens from your arm when the light spot is smallest and brightest.<br>
 This distance is the focal length of the lens.<br>
 Notice the distance of the lens from your arm when the spot feels hottest.<br>
 The two distances are different.<br>

Radiation shadow. radiation to and from the earth. clear cold night<br>
<a href="../images/23.3.3.gif">See diagram 23.3.3</a>: Radiation and distance.<br>
Put 4 thermometers at two different distances as two groups of two with both thermometers in the same group at the same level distance from a heat source,, but at different heights.<br>
Group 1. (distance 1. from heat source) t1 upper, t1 lower<br>
Group 2. (distance 2. from heat source) t2 upper, t2 lower<br> 
 Different groups are at different level distances from the heat source., e.g. electric household radiator.<br>
 Measure the distances from the heat source.<br>
 Turn on the heat source.<br>
 Record the reading on the thermometer at each position when the reading  stabilizes.<br>
 The intensity of thermal radiation from the heat source is dependent on the distance and independent on the direction.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="23.8.11H">23.8.11</a> Heat transferred by radiation. black body radiation<br>
 Stefan-Boltzmann law. Wien's law. KircHoff's law<br>
The Stefan-Boltzmann law states that the total energy radiated from a black body is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature of the body.<br>
 (Joseph Stefan 1835 - 1893. Ludwig Boltzmann 1844 -1906)<br>
 Heat can be transferred by wave motion. even across a vacuum.<br>
 This is called radiation.<br>
 Heat travels by radiation almost instantaneously.<br>
A "black body" is an imaginary body that absorbs all the thermal radiation onto it and is a perfect emitter of thermal radiation as a continuous spectrum.<br>
So the radiation includes all the wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation.<br>
 The intensity of the radiation is greatest at a wavelength that depends  only on the temperature of the body.<br>
Energy = σ × T<sup>4</sup>. ( σ (sigma) = 5.67 × 10<sup>-8</sup> Joules second<sup>-1</sup> metres Kelvin<sup>-4</sup>. and T = absolute temperature.<br>
 Total energy radiated = E × surface area × time.<br>
 A full radiator would absorb all the radiant energy falling on it.<br>
 Lampblack is close to being a full radiator.<br>
Wien's law (Wilhelm Wien. Germany 1864-1928) states the product of the absolute temperature of a body and the wave length of maximum radiation is a constant.<br>
 T × absolute temperature = constant.<br>
The wavelength at which the maximum energy is radiated from a source is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature of the source.<br>
 So as temperature rises. maximum radiation decreases.<br>
 Hotter objects emit most of their radiation at shorter wavelengths 
 and appear to be blue-white. white hot.<br>
 Cooler objects emit most of their radiation at longer wavelengths and appear red, because of infrared radiation, i.e. red hot.<br>
KircHoff's law of radiation (Gustav KircHoff 1824-1887) refers to the observation that black clothes are good absorbers of heat and good emitters of heat.<br>
However. on a hot day. the body wearing black clothes receives more heat than it can emit. so white clothes are preferred, because they are good reflectors of heat and poor absorbers of heat.<br>
 1. Hold your hand under an unlighted electric bulb. the palm upward.<br>
 Turn on the electricity.<br>
 Feel the heat almost as soon as you turn on the bulb.<br>
 The heat could not have reached your hand so quickly by conduction, because air is a very poor conductor of heat.<br>
 The heat could not reach your hand by convection, because convection
 carries the heat upward and away from your hand.<br>
 The heat came to your hand carried by short electromagnetic waves of
 wavelengths longer than light.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="23.8.12H">23.8.12</a> Leslie's cube<br>
 A Leslie's cube. invented by John Leslie. (1766 – 1832), Scotland. shows that surfaces at the same temperature do not radiate equally.<br>
The cube has three different surface areas: black, white, and two are smooth brass. or one grey and one silvered.<br>
The original was said to have side made of gold. silver. copper and white varnish.<br>
 1. Fill a Leslie's cube with water and heat with a Bunsen burner.<br>
 Compare the heat radiation from the surfaces with a thermopile or thermometer  or just use your hand to feel the difference.<br>
 The heat energy radiated from the surfaces is at the same temperature,, but different surfaces emit different amounts of heat.<br>
 The black surface radiates the most energy. then the white surface,  then the brass surface. or grey surface then silvered surface.<br>
 Move the thermopile to show the inverse square law. the magnitude of  the quality is proportional to the reciprocal of the distance from  the source.<br>
 2. Put a Leslie cube with opposite faces blackened between two bulbs  of a differential thermoscope.<br>
 3. A brass container coated on half of one surface with a matte black  paint and highly polished on the other.<br>
 Hot water is placed inside the cube and each surface presented in turn,  at the same distance to a thermopile.<br>
 4. PASCO'S Apparatus consists of a cube internally heated by a temperature  controlled light globe with black. white. shiny and matte  surfaces.<br>
 5. Place a Leslie's cube on a turntable so that alternate faces emit  radiation to a sensor to show that the radiant heat is greater from the  black surface.<br>

 One contains a heater controlled by a variac.<br>
 The other has a match at the focal point of the reflector.<br>
 Turn the variac all the way up and wait.<br>

 <hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="23.8.15H">23.8.15</a> Plate in a furnace<br>
A white plate with a black pattern on it appears as a dark plate with a grey pattern on it when placed in a furnace.<br>
Good reflectors are bad absorbers and bad radiators.<br>
The white plate is a good reflector. therefore when heated in the furnace it is a poor radiator compared with its surroundings and so appears dark.<br>
The black pattern will. as it is a bad reflector. be a good radiator compared with the plate at the same temperature. so appears relatively white.<br>
 being a glazed black. however. it is probably a better reflector. and hence a slightly worse radiator. than all other black portions of the furnace.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="23.8.16H">23.8.16</a> Radiant heat passes through glass<br>
 1.  Hold your cheek about 25 cm away from the hole in a plastic sheet fixed  in front of a heating element or the sun's rays.<br>
 The hole should be level with the glowing part of the heating element.<br>
 Insert a glass plate between your cheek and the hole.<br>
 Take it out and put it back. noting what you feel.<br>
 Repeat the experiment using two sheets of glass plate held together.<br>
 2. On a sunny day. feel the warmth from the sun through a clear glass window.<br>
 However. if you light a fire and place a sheet of glass between you and the fire. you cannot feel the warmth of the fire.<br>
The energy distribution curve for the sun has its maximum in the visible region. and the sun emits also considerable energy in the infrared and in<br>
 the region of short heat waves.<br>
 This energy passes through glass with little absorption.<br>
 The energy radiated by the fire mainly consists of heat rays of long wavelengths. and these wave lengths are almost completely absorbed by the glass.<br>

Remove the Bunsen burners and turn the copper sheet vertical.<br>
Hold the back of the hand near the bright and shiny side of the copper sheet, then near the dull black side of the copper sheet.<br>
<b>Be careful!</b> The back of the hand must not touch the hot copper sheet!<br>
You can bring the back of the hand much closer to the shiny side than to the black side.<br>
The two sides have the same temperature,, but more radiation comes from the black side of the copper sheet.<br>

A paper-covered tin can cools faster than a shiny can.<br>
In the radiator of a water-cooled engine, the water, heated by passing round the engine, passes through a hollow metal tubes.<br>
They conduct the heat through them to be taken up by the surrounding air, which is usually forced through the metal tubes by a fan.<br>
The radiator should be black to radiate best.<br>
The water is either pumped through the metal reticulation. or passes round it by convection currents.<br>
In a motor cycle. heat flows out through the metal cylinder to the metal flanges. whence it is radiated. or passed on to the surrounding air currents.<br>
The flanges ensure a big radiating surface. and big area of contact with the cooler air.<br>
They should be kept black.<br>

 Electromotive force, emf<br>
 A thermopile is a set of joined thermocouples.<br>
 A thermopile is made of thermocouple junction pairs connected electrically  in series.<br>
 The absorption of thermal radiation by one of the thermocouple junctions.<br> 
 called the active junction. increases its temperature.<br>
 Differential temperature between an active junction and a reference junction at fixed temperature produces an emf proportional to the differential temperature.<br> 
 This effect is called a thermoelectric effect.<br>
 For more sensitivity. thermocouples are joined in series to make a thermopile.<br>
 Thermopiles do not respond to absolute temperature., but generate an  output voltage proportional to a local temperature difference or  temperature gradient.<br>
 A thermopile consists of four iron and four copper wires twisted to form seven junctions to produce a thermoelectric emf.<br>
 The end terminals connect to a galvanometer.<br>
 Use a hand held hair drier is a suitable source of heat to activate  the thermopile.<br>

 1. Paint two thermoscopes. one thermoscope white the other black and  illuminate both by a lamp.<br>
 2. Two thermoscopes have a black surface and a white surface.<br>
 The pressure inside the thermoscopes is less than atmospheric pressure  and is equalized by the connecting tubes and valve A.<br>
 Close valve A so that the two thermoscopes are independent.<br>
Shine a 150 W spotlight on the thermoscopes and observe the difference in fluid height showing a difference in pressure between the two thermoscope tubes caused by different temperatures.<br>

* (2) in the sun and in the wind.<br>
* (3) sheltered from the sun and wind.<br>
* (4) in an ice chest or insulated portable cooler. e.g. "Esky".<br>
List the blocks of ice in order of complete melting.<br>
The ice will melt most rapidly in (2). then (1). then (3). then (4).<br>
1. The ice absorbs most heat directly from the sun by radiation and lesser heat from its surroundings by conduction and radiation,
 but chiefly by convection currents.<br>
 Some of the ice has melts to form a layer of water over the ice.<br>
 Water is a bad conductor of heat so the ice will melt more slowly if  the layer of water remains.<br>
 When the air is still. a layer of cold air forms round the ice and
reduces the amount of heat received from the air by convection.<br>
2. The layer of water over the ice evaporates
more freely than in (1) so that the ice is dried and so melts more quickly.<br>
 Unlike (1). new air is continually coming into contact with the ice. 
 so the amount of heat received by convection is not reduced.<br>
3. No heat is received by radiation from the sun  or by wind convection.<br>
 Some heat is received by conduction and radiation from the shaded surroundings  and some very small convection currents.<br>
4. No loss of heat by convection except from within the container.<br>
When the temperature of the interior of the container falls below room temperature, it receives heat from surroundings by convection, conduction and radiation.<br>
The rate depends on the temperature difference.<br>
The temperature of the container falls until the heat received by the container equals the heat used in melting the ice.<br>
The temperature difference for the container and air is less than for the ice and air. and the container is made of a bad conductor of heat.<br> 
So melting in (4) is the slowest.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="23.2.1H">23.2.1</a> Fluid expansion, coefficient of volume change, thermal expansion of water<br>
All of the above formula are applicable only if α has a small value and do not apply to substances where α changes with temperature.<br>
When a volume change with temperature occurs, the fraction by which he volume at 0 oC changes per oC is the coefficient of volume change, 
e.g. mercury = 180 × 10-6, air = 3400 × 10-6.<br>
 Liquids generally increase in volume as the temperature increases and have coefficients of cubic expansion about 10 times that of solids.<br>
 Water is an exception, because as you heat water from 0 oC, it contracts rather than expands.<br>
 At 4 oC, water occupies its smallest volume, i.e. it has the highest density.<br>
 So water obeys the general laws of thermal expansion, except in the temperature interval from 0 oC to 4 oC.<br>
The cubic expansion formula does not apply to expansion of gases, because all gases expand by 1/273 of their volume at 0 oC as in Charles's law.<br>
For expansion of gases, you must use Charles's law (The law of volumes):<br>
The volume of an ideal gas at constant pressure is directly proportional to the absolute temperature.<br>
Air, and most other gases at atmospheric pressure, have a coefficient of cubic expansion of 0.0034 (oC)-1.<br>

 The water level initially falls as the bottle expands then rises as the liquid is warmed and expands.<br>

 Depending on the rate of cooling the liquid will initially rise as the bottle contracts and then drop as the liquid cools and contracts.<br>
 This experiment shows the principle of the liquid in glass thermometer.<br>
 Note that the water level drops at first when you begin the heating and then it rises, because the glass starts to expand before the water inside.<br>
 If a long tube filled with red water is immersed in a boiling water bath, the level of the red water will drop before rising.<br>
3. Use two identical small plastic bottles.<br>

 When the flask is heated, the xpands and the new level of liquid in the neck of the flask can be marked.<br>
 However, this difference of levels does not represent the true expansion of the liquid, because the glass in the flask has also expanded.<br>

 Slowly heat the flask while carefully watching the level of coloured water in the glass tubing.<br>
 When you heat the flask, the water level initially falls as the glass in the flask expands then rises as the water expands.<br>

 The water rises in the tubing.<br>
 However, if you carefully observe the water level in the tubing when the heating begins, you will see that it falls slightly and then begins to rise!<br>
 It falls, because the glass in the flask starts to expand before the water inside.<br>

 Expansion due to heat, thermal expansion, expansivity, coefficient of expansion<br>
 Most bodies increase their volume upon heating under normal pressure.<br>
Solids retain their shape during temperature variations,.so distinguish between linear expansion, area expansion and volume expansion (cubic expansion).<br>
Applications of solid expansion include shrink fitting, riveting, expansion gap, expansion roller, bimetallic strip, fire alarm, thermostat.<br>
Put the cover on the pot before heating the pot, because the pot will expand on heating and then you cannot put the top on the pot.<br>
 Linear expansion<br>
 The length of a solid changes with temperature.<br>
 The coefficient of linear expansion, α, is the fraction by which
the length at 0 oC changes per oC change in temperature.<br>
 For example, for Aluminium, α = 23 × 10-6, but most tables just show Aluminium = 23, Copper 16.7, Iron 11.8, Glass 8.5.<br>
 If a solid at temperature t1, width length L1, expands at temperature t2 to length L2, then L2 =L1 [1 + α (t2 - t1)], OR<br>
 L = Lo (1 + α T), where α = the coefficient of linear expansion, L = final length, Lo = original length, T = change in temperature,<br>
 Surface expansion (superficial expansion, area expansion)<br>
 Similarly A2 = A1 [1 + 2 α (t2 -t1)], OR<br>
 A = Ao (1+2 α T)<br>
 α A = 1 / A × dA / dT, where A = area and dA / dT is the rate of change of that area per unit change in temperature.<br>
 Surface expansion has been likened to expansion of a photographic print.<br>
 Cubic expansion<br>
 V2 = V1 [1 + 3 α ([t2 - t1)]<br>
 The coefficient of cubic expansion for a solid, is about three times the coefficient of linear expansion.<br>
A cube of edge 1 cm at 0 oC and volume 1 cc would become a cube of edge (1+ α ) cm at 1 oC,<br>
so its volume would become (1 + α )3 = (1 + 3x +3x2 + α3 ) cc.<br>
However, for solids, α is very small, so x2 and x3 are negligible, hence the formula V2 = V1 [1 + 3 α ([t2 - t1)].<br>

Most substance expand when heated as distances between atoms increase.<br>
The coefficient of thermal expansion characterizes the expansion of various bodies as the degree of expansion divided by the change in temperature.<br>
The coefficient of linear thermal expansion is the ratio of the change in length per degree K to the length at 273 K.<br>
The coefficient of volume expansion is about three times the linear coefficient.<br>
Negative thermal expansion<br>
Negative thermal expansion (NTE) (not called "thermal contraction"), occurs in some substances, e.g. zirconium tungstate (ZrW2O8), zirconium, 
vanadate (ZrV2O7), scandium trifluoride (ScF3), forms of silicon between 18 and 120 Kelvin, and rubber bands.<br>
Glass-ceramic cooktops are non-porous mixtures of MgO, Al2O3, SiO2 glass with positive coefficient of thermal expansion and crystals with negative
 coefficient of thermal expansion, a material that experiences no thermal shock.<br>
Water<br>
The coefficient of thermal expansion of water drops to zero as it is cooled to 4 oC (3.983 oC), then becomes negative.<br>
Water has a maximum density at this temperature.<br>
In sub-zero temperatures, the ice on the surface of a pond may have a lower temperature than the water underneath it, so fish can survive below the ice.<br>

As the temperature rises, the radius arm of the balance wheel expands to increase the moment of inertia about the axis and increase the period.<br>
The increasing temperature also reduces the elasticity of the hair spring to also increases the period.<br>
To compensate for these effects, the balance wheel is made of two strips of dissimilar metals fastened together, bimetallic strips, so that the metal with
 the smaller coefficient of expansion is on the inner side of the bimetallic strip.<br>
When the temperature increases, the radius of curvature of the bimetallic strip decreases, because of the lesser increase in length of the inside strip
 and P and Q are fixed, so R and S move in towards the axis, the moment of inertia of the balance wheel is lessened and the corresponding decrease in period
 compensates exactly for the increase in period caused by the change in elasticity.<br>

 1. The experiment demonstrates the diameter expansion of metal caused by heat.<br>
 At room temperature a ball that is slightly larger than the ring will not pass through it.<br>
 Heat the ring over the Bunsen burner.<br>
 The ball can now pass through the ring.<br>
2. The apparatus consists of a ball and ring constructed
 so that at room temperature the ball just passes through the ring.<br>
 On heating the ball in the bunsen flame, expansion is demonstrated by the ball being unable to pass through the ring.<br>
3. The apparatus consists of a heavy metal ball  that at room temperature just passes through a hole in the base plate of the support.<br>
 Expansion is demonstrated by heating the ball in the bunsen flame, whereupon  the ball is unable to pass through the hole.<br>
4. Use a large metal screw and a screw-eye through  which the head of the screw just passes.<br>
 Alternatively, use a metal ball that just passes through a metal ring,  or a bar that will just pass through a gauge.<br>
 Attach the screw and screw eye into the ends of a stick.<br>
 Hold the stick to heat the head of the screw in a burner flame.<br>
 Try to pass the screw through the screw eye.<br>
 The screw cannot pass, because of expansion caused by heating.<br>
 Keep the screw hot and heat the screw eye in the flame simultaneously.<br>
 Now the screw head can pass through the screw eye.<br>
 Keep the screw head in the flame and cool the screw eye in cold water.<br>
 The screw head cannot pass through the screw eye.<br>
5. If you cannot open a glass jar with a metal screw top, hold the jar upside down so that the metal screw top is touching hot water.<br>
 The metal screw top expands more than the glass and you can open the glass jar.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="23.3.8H">23.3.8</a>  Bar breaker, the force of contraction<br>
1. Heat an iron bar then tighten it in a yoke so it breaks a cast iron
 bar when the bar cools.<br>
2. Bar breaker<br>
Construct a strong iron bar so that it rests in two yokes on a cast iron base.<br>
 Pin the bar on one end by a thin cast iron pin, and thread it on the other end so that it can be tightened.<br>
 Heat the bar with the gas jets located directly beneath the bar.<br>
 Tighten the bar as it is heated.<br>
 After the bar is fully tightened, dowse it with water.<br>
 As the bar contracts the forces present are large enough to snap the cast iron pin.<br>
 There is a delay between initial cooling and fracture of up to 30 seconds.<br>

Bimetallic strip, compound bar, invar, thermostat<br>
<a href="../images/23.107.gif">See diagram 23.107</a> : Bimetallic strip<br>
 Coefficient of liner expansion of brass = 19 × 10-6 K-1 at 20 oC.<br>
 Coefficient of liner expansion of invar steel = 1.2 × 10-6 K-1 at 20 oC.<br>
 "Invar" is trade name for an alloy composed of iron 63.8%, nickel 36%,  carbon 0.2%.<br>
 "Invar" is abbreviation of "invariable".<br>
 It is used in surveyors' measuring tapes, pendulums, and tuning forks.<br>
Bimetallic strips are used to switch thermostats and fire alarms on or off when a small bimetallic strip acts as a switch by bending away
from an electrical contact when heated.<br>
 1. The experiment demonstrates the unequal expansion of different metals.<br>
 Strips of dissimilar metals bonded together bend when heated.<br>
 Use a bimetallic strip with brass on one side and steel on the other side.<br>
 When this strip heated over a Bunsen burner, the strip curves toward the steel side.<br>
 When cooled in liquid nitrogen, the strip curves toward the brass side.<br>
 The bimetallic strip suffers appreciable curvature within a few seconds of being placed in the flame of the bunsen burner.<br>
 Leave the bimetallic strip in a container of liquid nitrogen.<br>
 The bimetallic strip curves towards the brass side, because the brass contracts more.<br>
2. A pair of iron and brass strips riveted together bends when heated, because of the difference of expansion of the two metals.<br>
 The strip curves towards the steel side, because the brass expands more.<br>
 Mount a pointer on the end of a bimetallic strip.<br>
3. Use two 25 cm strips of brass and invar steel welded together as a bimetallic strip.<br>
 Make holes in the metal strips with a nail and fix small tacks as rivets.<br>
 Fasten the strips together by cutting them with projections at equal intervals and bend the projections over to interlock.<br>
 The strip curves towards the steel side, because the brass expands more.<br>

<a href="../images/23.106.gif">See diagram 23.106</a> : Expansion of solid A = copper tubing, B = clamp, C = bicycle spoke roller, D = straw.<br>
1. To show and compare thermal expansion of different metals.<br>
 The expansion apparatus consists of a cast iron base with two vertical supports that hold the metal expansion rod.<br>
 The pointer is zeroed by the adjusting screw illustrated and the burners lighted beneath the rod.<br>
 Use aluminium, brass, copper and mild steel expansion rods.<br>
 Expansion of the rod causes deflection of the pointer and this deflection may be compared for the different metals for the same time interval.<br>
2. Use a 2 metre piece of stout copper tubing.<br>
 Put it on a table and fix one end by a clamp.<br>
 Underneath the other end put a bicycle spoke to act as a roller.<br>
 A drinking straw fixed to the roller by wax will show any movement of the rod resting on it.<br>
 Blow steadily down the tube between the fixed end and the middle.<br>
 This arrangement detects the expansion of the tube caused by the hot breath.<br>
 Pass steam through the tube, and note the motion of the pointer.<br>
 Repeat the experiment with different types of tubing.<br>
3. Heat a 60 cm copper rod for five minutes with a Bunsen burner.<br>
Note the movement of the pointer.<br>
The rod rests on a knitting needle so when the rod moves it rolls the needle.<br>
If the expanding rod caused the needle to do one complete turn of 360 degrees, the hot copper rod has
 expanded a distance equal to the circumference of the knitting needle.<br>
