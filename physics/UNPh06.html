<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="2.2.1H">2.2.1</a> Blueprints and diazo prints<br>
 It is sold as: "Sun Blueprint Paper".<br>
 A blueprint is a photographic print of a plan or technical drawing in white lines on a blue background.<br>
1. Tape the edges and hinge two glass plates 25 cm by 35 cm along one long edge.<br>
 Put a sheet of blueprint paper, green side up, on one of the two glass
 plates.<br>
 Lay a flat object, e.g. a leaf, on the blueprint paper.<br>
 Hold the object in place with the second pane of glass.<br>
 Expose the plate to the sun.<br>
 Remove the blueprint paper and wash it with tap water to remove any remaining light sensitive substance.<br>
 Lay the blueprint paper on a smooth, flat table to dry.<br>
2. Use the same procedure to make a diazo print, but after exposure to the sun do not wash the paper in tap water.<br>
 Instead, expose the blueprint paper to ammonia fumes in a large jar for several minutes, so that light can make no further changes on the blueprint paper.<br>
(Diazo = bleaching action of ultraviolet radiation on diazonium salts)<br>
3. Make blueprint paper.<br>
 In a dark room, dissolve 10 g of potassium ferricyanide in 50 mL of water and dissolve 10 g of ferric ammonium citrate in 50 ml of water.<br>
 Store the solutions in a dark cupboard.<br>
 In a dark room, mix equal volumes of the two solutions and place in a shallow tray.<br>
 Float a piece of paper on the mixture for a few seconds or solution or wipe the solution onto the paper with a soft brush.<br>
 Hang up the paper to dry in the dark room then store the blueprint paper in a dark place.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="2.2.2H">2.2.2</a> Electrical outlets and equipment<br>
1. Permanent general purpose electrical outlets must be in a safe and operational condition.<br>
New installations must be fitted with automatic blind outlets.<br>
A qualified electrician should service and check all 240 V electrical equipment.<br>
Equipment suppliers must supply schools with equipment that complies with government specifications, including appropriate earthing and use of approved insulating materials.<br>
2. Electric current passing through the human body may cause breathing to stop, heart to stop, burns to the skin and internal organs, muscle spasm, clinical shock and falls that cause further injuries.<br>
The danger depends on the value of the current and the body resistance.<br>
The "let-go current" ("cannot let-go current") is the maximum current a person can tolerate when holding an electrode and still let go of this electrode using muscles directly stimulated by this current.<br>
The value of this current is about 10 milliamperes.<br>
Higher currents can cause muscle freezing that prevents the person releasing the hand from the conductor.<br>
In Australia, the electricity reticulation system is MEN (Multiple Earth Neutral), i.e. the neutral wire is earthed at the powerhouse, at the point of supply to each consumer and at other points along the line between the powerhouse and consumer.<br>
3. Electric shock may occur when a person contacts the active pin in a power point or switch or an exposed active wire in a lead.<br>
For a touch voltage of 240 volts AC, the body resistance between its extremities is about 1000 ohms and the current flowing through the person would be 240 milliamperes causing serious results.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="2.2.3H">2.2.3</a> Filtering<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="2.2.4H">2.2.4</a> Fume cupboards, fume hoods<br>
<a href="../images/1.13a.gif">See diagram 1.13a</a>: Simple fume hood.<br>
 Fume cupboards: Enclosed reinforced cupboard with facilities for chemical reactions and used under negative air pressure.<br>
 1. Do not use fume cupboards for long-term storage of any chemicals or as distribution areas for class sets of chemicals and equipment.<br>
 2. Most fume cupboards have an extraction fan mounted in the flue that conducts exhaust gases and vapours to the atmosphere.<br>
 Check the extraction fan regularly.<br>
 Heat-induced convection types of fume cupboards have a gas burner at the entrance to the flue to cause a rising convection current.<br>
 However, these units may be fire hazards if flammable gases or liquids are placed in the fume cupboard.<br>
 3. Fume cupboards should periodically be checked by competent safety authorities.<br>
 4. Fume cupboards provide a means of isolating hazardous gases and vapours from the classroom and dispersing them into the atmosphere.<br>
 Lock fume cupboard doors to prevent access to preparation and storage rooms from the teaching of science area.<br>
 Do not use fume cupboards for long term storage of any chemicals or as distribution areas for class sets of chemicals and equipment.<br>
 5.0 Types of fume cupboards with different methods of dispersal to the atmosphere.<br>
5.1 Mechanical types of fume cupboards:<br>
Most modern fume cupboards have an extraction fan mounted in the flue that creates sufficient exhaust gases and vapours to the atmosphere.<br>
 Service extraction fans periodically to remove any physical obstructions (e.g. birds' nests) and check on corrosion of the electric motor or fan.<br>
 5.2 Heat induced convection types of fume cupboards:<br>
 These older style units have a gas burner mounted permanently at the entrance to the flue.<br>
 When alight the hot gases cause a rising convection current that draws the hazardous gas or vapour through the flue.<br>
 These units pose a significant fire hazard when flammable gases or liquids are placed in the fume cupboard when the burner is alight.<br>
 Do not attempt to use the burner in these fume cupboards.<br>
 5.3 Diffusion types of fume cupboards:<br>
 A fume cupboard may have a simple flue that allows dispersal of gases and vapours by molecular diffusion.<br>
 This type of unit cannot be used to disperse gases that are heavier than air.<br>
 They will accumulate in the bottom of the unit and slowly leak back into the classroom.<br>
 These units are not acceptable for use in gas dispersion.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="2.2.5H">2.2.5</a> Gas installations and inspections<br>
1. Gas bottles (9 kg or less).<br>
The school is responsible for maintaining and filling these cylinders, and for having them tested after they are ten years old.<br>
It is illegal for a refilling station to refill cylinders older than 10 years that have not been tested again.<br>
2. Permanent gas installations.<br>
These include laboratories supplied with large 45 kg cylinders of LPG or connected to natural gas or town gas.<br>
They should service all permanent installations annually.<br>
In this service, turrets, control valves and cylinders are checked for correct operation and leaks.<br>
The age of cylinders is also checked.<br>
If they are found out of date, the contractor will check with the school for the date of the last refill.<br>
If we have not refilled the cylinders for some time, they will ask the school to organize a refill whether the cylinders are empty or not.<br>
3. Cylinders may be refilled on site or replaced.<br>
It is the refiller's responsibility to check the date on your cylinder and provide cylinders that are current.<br>
4. Isolation valves.<br>
Turn all gas off when not in use.<br>
Areas for the teaching of science with permanent gas are fitted with isolation valves.<br>
These may be manual, or an electronic keypad controlled, isolation valves.<br>
All personnel who are using rooms equipped with reticulated gas supply should familiarize themselves with the various methods of isolating gas, when not in use.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="2.2.6H">2.2.6</a> Gas-Pak<br>
<a href="../images/2.11.gif">See diagram 2.11</a> Gas-Pak.<br>
 Be careful! The gas forms an inflammable mixture with air.<br>
 The Gas-Pak consists of a burner connected to a small disposable can of gas.<br>
 Instructions for use.<br>
 1. Remove the cap from the Gas-Pak can.<br>
 With the control knob in the "off" position, push the plug-in valve firmly onto the can.<br>
 Close the sleeve holes.<br>
 Light a match.<br>
 Turn the control knob slowly to the "on" position until gas flows.<br>
 Light the burner.<br>
 Adjust the gas control knob and sleeve on the burner.<br>
 2. If the flame is poor, check the gas content of the can, check that the plug-in valve is seated correctly, adjust the gas control knob.<br>
 3. If the flame is still poor, turn off the gas and wait for the burner to cool.<br>
 Unscrew the burner head on the gas.<br>
 Use the jet pricker wire to clear the jet by inserting the pricker wire into the jet hole and moving it up and down until the jet is clear and the gas flow is normal.<br>
 Relight the burner as above.<br>
 4. Use the burner only in a draught free area.<br>
 Always keep the can upright when the burner is alight.<br>
 Check any warnings on the can.<br>
 Allow the burner to cool before you move or store it.<br>
 Dispose of Gas-Pak cans safely, i.e. do not puncture or incinerate them.<br>
 5. Do not turn the gas on without lighting the burner.<br>
 Do not heat low melting point objects directly over the barrel of the burner, e.g. plastics, solder, lead, because pieces may fall inside the barrel of the burner.<br>
 Instead, hold the burner at an angle to the barrel.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="2.2.7H">2.2.7</a> Prepare sets of apparatus<br>
 1. Consistent use in daily laboratory activities, e.g. glassware sets.<br>
 2. Occasional use in demonstrations, or in rotation by student groups.<br>
 3. Individual student use.<br>
 Issue some equipment from the store in the laboratory as permanent issue.<br>
 Issue other equipment daily from stock.<br>
 4. Sets for everyday use, e.g. glassware, measuring devices, basic chemicals.<br>
 These sets must be established and maintained as breakage and usage reduce the basic stock.<br>
 5. Sets for demonstrations.<br>
 Partially or wholly assembled equipment may be gathered and stored in a suitable location with a label showing the relevance of the material, e.g. physics apparatus for demonstrating the Bernoulli effect.<br>
 6. Sets for issue.<br>
Many items are normally kept separate and assembled by the student as they are issued from the store, e.g. batteries, terminals and leads.<br>
 However, student kits for particular experiments are frequently stored as complete sets.<br>
 Materials from these sets should not be "borrowed" for other experiments.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="2.2.8H">2.2.8</a> Prepare stock materials and apparatus<br>
Clamps</a> Commercial<br>
1. Lengths of insulated copper wire with bared ends, or with alligator clips screwed to the ends, or with 4 mm plugs attached to the ends.<br>
2. Standard coils, using cardboard or polythene cylinders as the core.<br>
3. Simple wood baseboards with terminals, for making simple circuits.<br>
4. Atomic and molecular kits into a predetermined order.<br>
5. Collection of raw materials.<br>
Acetate or cellophane squares, e.g. red, yellow, blue, agar jelly or gelatine, aluminium foil,<br>
balance spring, bicycle pumps, bottles, brass gauze, brass sheet, bronze mesh, brass pins<br>
candles, cardboard squares, clothes pegs, copper wire, copper sheet, copper turnings, corks, cork slabs, cotton reels, cardboard cylinders, chalk boxes,<br>
dry cells, drinking glass,<br>
fibreglass, fly screens, flannel rags, fencing wire,<br>
G-clamp, grease-proof paper,<br>
hacksaw blades, hand drill, hand tools,<br>
iron filings, iron nails, iron pins, iron filings,<br>
jam tins with press-on lids,<br>
lubricating oil and grease, olive oil,
metal sheets, metal pulley wheels, marbles, mirrors,<br>

razor blades, rubber balloons, rubber bands, rubber balls, olive oil, suction cups, silk pieces, sewing needles, screw eyes, springs,<br>
thread, thermometers, torches, table forks, tin snips.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="2.2.9H">2.2.9</a> Razor blades and knives<br>
<a href="../images/2.10.gif">See diagram 2.10</a> Good and bad razor blades.<br>
 Use single edge razor blades, e.g. "Gem" brand, instead of the usual double edge razor blades.<br>
 Students find single edge blades easier to use, and they are less likely to cut themselves.<br>
 Teach students to always cut in the direction away from the body.<br>
 Use knives by cutting down on the bench.<br>
 Reduce the use of knives and razor blades by giving the students precut material.<br>
 At the end of the class check that all razor blades and knives have been returned.<br
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="2.2.10H">2.2.10</a> Stock control<br>
 1. Every science department must have two stock books, one for consumable chemicals and one for apparatus and other hardware.<br>
 On taking over a laboratory, check the stock books to ensure: a stocktakel was done in the previous year, the stock as listed is correct.<br>
 Store equipment or chemicals immediately after use.<br>
 Have a designated place for each type of item.<br>
 Leaving equipment out on benches invites pilfering or breakage.<br>
 Keep a breakage book in the science room and enter all breakage as soon as practicable after they occur.<br>
 This is essential if you are to account for all apparatus at the next stocktakel.<br>
 2. When new stock arrives, enter the quantity and the date of receipt in the appropriate columns in the stock records.<br>
 Store separately any broken or unserviceable equipment other than glassware, rubber stoppers and tubing, or plastic ware.<br>
 During stocktakel all equipment should be inspected by the stocktakelr and any damaged, unserviceable or potentially dangerous equipment put aside.<br>
 This is especially necessary with equipment handled by students.<br>
 Test-tube holders, beaker tongs, and stands should all be checked, and new items ordered if any are defective.<br>
 Never allow chipped or cracked glassware to be used.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="2.2.11H">2.2.11</a> Unpack, check and sort new equipment<br>
 1. When equipment arrives, it must be unpacked in a location that allows the materials to be set out and checked against the enclosed invoice.<br>
 Any discrepancies or breakage should be noted and the supplier notified.<br>
 Enter the quantity and date of receipt in the appropriate columns of the stock records.<br>
 2. Some materials will act as replacements while other items will need storage space assigned to them.<br>
 Items of "short life", e.g. dry cells, should be date-stamped before storage.<br>
Consumable stock, e.g. chemicals, should be date-stamped before storage to reduce possible wastage of those chemicals that may deteriorate with storage.<br>
Annotate the label with a felt pen to show the year of supply.<br>
Store stock, e.g. chemicals, with oldest stock in front to reduce wastage.<br>
Items marked "to follow" on invoices will be supplied when obtainable, unless schools signify that they are no longer required.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="2.2.12H">2.2.12</a> Use safe practice and procedures<br>
1. Dry hands thoroughly before operating any switch.<br>
2. Do not remove the cover plates of power points or switches.<br>
If the cover plate has been removed or damaged, do use it until repaired by a qualified electrician.<br>
Do not attempt to repair a power point or switch yourself.<br>
Do not attempt to repair mains-operated equipment, e.g. hot water systems, ceiling fans, refrigerators.<br>
3. Switches must be in the "off" position before inserting plugs or removing plugs from power points.<br>
4. When removing plugs from power points, grasp the plug firmly and pull.<br>
Do not pull on the lead.<br>
5. Do not let students push metal objects into power points or poke at pilot lights with metal objects.<br>
6. Hand-held equipment, e.g. electric drills, unless double insulated, must be operated through an isolating transformer or a core balance earth leakage device to protect the operator from injury if the earth connection is faulty.<br>
7. Avoid using 240 volt equipment near sinks or water outlets or close to gas outlets where accidental sparking may ignite gas leaks.<br>
8. Disconnect portable appliances from the power outlet when not in use or before cleaning.<br>
9. When connecting several appliances to the mains, use power boards, not double adapters.<br>
10. Inspect all leads for frayed or cracked insulation.<br>
Do not knot or sharply bend leads or nail leads to the wall.<br>
Under the current Australian Standard International Standard the "live lead" is red to brown, the "neutral lead" is black to blue, the "earth lead" is green or yellow.<br>
The "earth lead" is to earth the metal case of equipment to prevent shock to the user should a short circuit occur between the electrically "live" parts of the equipment and the metal case.<br>
The other two wires carry the electric current operating the equipment.<br>
 
 <hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="2.2.13H">2.2.13</a> Water stills<br>
 A potential exists if stills do not have an automatic power supply cut-off in case of failure of the water supply.<br>
 If the water supply fails, the unit may overheat and cause a fire.<br>
 Most models produced in the last 10 years have automatic cut-off switches fitted.<br>
 These switches should be periodically checked.<br>
 Do not operate stills overnight or leave unattended for long periods during the day.<br>

Fill pipettes with a pipette-filler and not by sucking by mouth.<br>
Glass pipettes can cause lacerations to the hands of operators.<br>
Using the mouth to operate a pipette is prohibited in school laboratories, so pipette aids, fillers and pumps must be used to allow users to avoid mouth contact with chemicals and biological materials.<br>
However, injuries may occur when a glass pipette is being inserted into a pipette filler or when placing the rubber bulb onto a glass Pasteur pipette, ready for use.<br>
Alternatives to pipettes include pipettes that use a plastic disposable tip to dispense volumes to 5 ml and repetitive dispensing from a single bottle of a solution using a dispenser.<br>
Polycarbonate pipettes can be used to replace glass bulb and graduated pipettes.<br>
Disposable polyethylene Pasteur pipettes can be used in place of glass Pasteur pipettes.<br>
Disposable polyethylene Pasteur pipettes are moulded as one piece with the bulb incorporated into the body of the pipette, so it is not necessary to purchase separate bulbs.<br>
A rubber pumpette that inserts into the end of the pipette and has no valves has no recorded pipette breakage.<br>
However, this type of pipette aid is not suitable for pipettes that have a cotton wool plug.<br>

<a href="../images/2.15.gif">See diagram 2.15: </a> Cut glass with straight cut<br>
1. To cut window glass and Perspex (Lucite), with a straight cut.<br>
 A glass cutter does not cut glass.<br>
 It splits the glass with a tiny wheel.<br>
 A glass cutter makes a scratch or groove by crushing the surface the glass.<br>
 The sides of the glass cutting wheel act as wedges to push against the sides of the groove and start a small crack.<br>
Experiment<br>
 Practise on scrap glass to get the pressure needed for a smooth edge.<br>
 If a crack fails to start, tap the scratch or score with the ball end of the glass cutter.<br>
 2. Perspex (Lucite), polymethyl methacrylate, is a hard plastic material, so it is not difficult to cut it with a hacksaw, but it is not easy to cut it straight.<br>
 Scribe the surface with a broken hacksaw blade.<br>
 Place it on a tabletop and align the scratch or score with the rim of the table.<br>
 Press the part on the table with your hand and quickly hit the other side of the Perspex in the air so that it separates cleanly along the scratch.<br>
3. If the glass cutter wheel is sharp and it is drawn over the glass at the right speed and pressure, it makes a fine score or groove by slightly crushing or pulverizing the glass.<br>
 The bevelled sides of the wheel act as wedges that push against the sides of the groove and pry the glass apart so that a crack is started.<br>
 Practise on scrap glass to get the pressure needed for a smooth edge.<br>
 Before trying to make a finished cut, practise on a scrap piece to learn the speed and pressure required to obtain a smooth edge.<br>
 Ordinary window glass comes in two thickness, single light and double light.<br>
 Single light glass is thinner and easier to cut.<br>
 Plate glass up to 0.6 cm in thickness can be cut in the same manner as ordinary window glass.<br>
 Safety glass that consists of two or more glass sheets cemented together by a transparent plastic, requires special cutting equipment.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="2.3.2H">2.3.2</a> Cut glass tubing<br>
 Glass tubing cutter, up to 38 mm diameter</a> Commercial<br>
<a href="../images/2.16.gif">See diagram 2.16</a> Break or bend glass tubing.<br>
Experiment<br>
Use glass tubing, 6 mm outside diameter, 750 mm length.<br>
Use plastic tubing, clear, 8 mm inside diameter, 30 metre roll.<br>
1. One way to cut glass tubing is to score the surface with one forward stroke of a three cornered file.<br>
Make the score mark at right angles to the centre line of the tube so that the tube will snap squarely across.<br>
To snap the tube, place it on the bench top with matchsticks or toothpick directly beneath the upward facing score mark.<br>
Then, holding one end securely, press down on the other end and the snap will be immediate.<br>
2. Another method used is to scratch the glass tubing with a quick smooth file stroke, then hold the scratched tubing firmly in both hands with thumbs pointing towards each other, but on opposite sides of the scratch, and snapping the glass tubing away from this body.<br>
Fire polish the cut ends.<br>
3. The method of cutting a glass tube depends on its diameter.<br>
Different methods are used to cut glass tubes of different diameters.<br>
Place the tube flat on the table.<br>
Measure the required length.<br>
Hold the tube firmly and draw a triangular file across it a couple of times so that a scratch is made.<br>
Do not saw back and forth.<br>
One or two firm cuts are usually sufficient.<br>
Take the tube in both hands, one each side of the scratch.<br>
Keep your thumbs as close as possible to the scratch.<br>
Press gently with your thumbs and pull with the fingers.<br>
The two pieces of tubing should separate.<br>
Brute strength is not needed.<br>
If the tube does not break easily, make the file scratch a little deeper and longer.<br>
Fire polish the cut ends.<br>
Light the burner, and open the air hole.<br>
This gives a hot blue flame.<br>
Warm one end of the tubing by passing it through the flame a few times.<br>
When the tubing is warm, rotate the end of the tube in the flame until the glass begins to turn yellow and melt a little.<br>
Keep rotating the tube until the rough edges become smooth.<br>
Do not heat too much and do not stop rotating.<br>
Place the hot glass on a gauze mat to cool.<br>
The end is now fire-polished.<br>
When the tube is cool, fire polish the other cut end.<br>
Again leave to cool.<br>
 4. Place the tube flat on the table.<br>
 Measure the required length.<br>
 Hold the tube firmly and draw a triangular file across it a couple of
 times so that it makes a scratch.<br>
 Do not saw back and forth.<br>
 One or two firm cuts are usually sufficient.<br>
 Take the tube in both hands, one each side of the scratch.<br>
 Keep your thumbs as close as possible to the scratch.<br>
 Press gently with your thumbs and pull with the fingers.<br>
 The two pieces of tubing should separate.<br>
 Do not use brute strength.<br>
 If the tube does not break easily, make the file scratch a little deeper
 and longer.<br>
 5. Fire polish the cut ends.<br>
 Light the burner, and open the air hole.<br>
 This gives a hot blue flame.<br>
 Warm one end of the tubing by passing it through the flame a few times.<br>
 When the tubing is warm, rotate the end of the tube in the flame until the glass begins to turn yellow and melt a little.<br>
 Keep rotating the tube until the rough edges become smooth.<br>
 Do not heat too much and do not stop rotating.<br>
 Place the hot glass on a gauze mat to cool.<br>
 The end is now fire polished.<br>
 When the tube is cool, fire polish the other cut end.<br>
 Again leave to cool.<br>
 Put all broken glass in a special labelled container, not in the waste paper basket.<br>
 6. Seal the end of a thin glass tube.<br>
 Place the glass tube at the top of the hot blue flame of the Bunsen burner, because the flame is the hottest there and rotate the tube to heat it uniformly.<br>
 Note that the part being heated is some part at the middle of the glass tube, not its end.<br>
 When the part being heated becomes hot and soft, clamp the two ends of the tube and pull the tube outwards so that the part being heated.<br>
 It becomes thin into a capillary.<br>
 If go on pulling, the thinnest part will fall down.
So the original tube will become into two tubes and their ends have been sealed, or have became very thin.<br>
 Place one end of the tube at the top of the hot blue flame of the Bunsen burner and rotate it during heating it until the end is sealed completely, and it becomes very smooth.<br>
 Leave the tube off the flame and blow the inside of its open end while it is hot to make the end sealed smoother.<br>
 Stress relief the sealed end by gently heating, but do not soften the glass.<br>
7. Seal the end of a thick glass tube.<br>
Place one end of the glass tube at top of the hot blue flame of the Bunsen burner, where the flame is the hottest, and rotate the tube to heat it uniformly.<br>
 When the end is soft, lower the cool end so that the heated end is at the top.<br>
 Keep rotating and heating until the glass at the end heated becomes soft and flows into the tube so that the end is sealed completely.<br>

<a href="../images/2.16.gif">See diagram 2.16</a>: Break or bend glass tubing.<br>
 Attach a flame spreader to the barrel of the Bunsen burner.<br>
 Light the burner and open the air hole to get a hot blue flame.<br>
 Using both hands, move the glass tubing back and forth through the top of the flame while rotating the tubing.<br>
 Heat about 5 centimetres of tubing.<br>
 When the tubing is warm, lower it into the dark blue cone of the flame.<br>
 Keep rotating the tubing until it glows red and becomes soft.<br>
 Take the tubing out of the flame and bend it slowly and steadily.<br>
 Do not force the bending and once bent do not reheat the tubing.<br>
 Keep holding the tubing until it starts to cool then put it on the gauze mat to cool to room temperature.<br>

 Glass cleaning safety<br>
 Strong cleaning solvents should be used by the teacher, not by students.<br>
 Dissolve 100 g potassium dichromate in a solution of 100 g concentrated sulfuric acid in 1 litre of water.<br>
 Glassware can be soaked in the solution, which may be used repeatedly again.<br>
 Be careful! Take great care to avoid getting this very corrosive solution on skin or clothes.<br>
 When diluting concentrated sulfuric acid, use a stone or earthenware vessel.<br>
 Pour the acid very slowly into the water, as a great amount of heat is given out in the process.<br>
 The teacher should use his knowledge of chemistry to remove stains of known origin.<br>
 If dirty vessels have contained alkalis, or salts with alkaline reactions, then the cleaning effect of a little dilute acid should be tried first.<br>
 If the stain is due to potassium permanganate, then the effect of sodium sulfite solution, acidified with dilute sulfuric acid should be tried.<br>

<a href="../images/2.18.gif">See diagram 2.18</a> Insert glass tubing through a stopper.<br>
 Be careful! Inexperienced teachers and students should not attempt this procedure.<br>
 1. Method A.<br>
 Check that the tubing will fit into the one-hole stopper.<br>
 The ends of the tubing should be fire polished with no sharp edges.<br>
 Wet the tube and the stopper with water containing a little detergent.<br>
 This makes them slippery and s easier to get the tube through the stopper.<br>
 Use the cloth to hold the tube firmly.<br>
 Place a leather gardening glove on the hand that will hold the stopper.<br>
 Slowly rotate the stopper on the tube.<br>
 Keep wetting the stopper and tubing so that the tube slides easily.<br>
 Be careful! Never hold the palm of the hand over the end of the test-tube.<br>
 2. Method B.<br>
 Lubricate the glass tubing with glycerol or water.<br>
 Wrap glass tubing in a towel.<br>
 Hold the glass tubing with the towel, then push it through the stopper with a twisting motion.<br>
 3. Method C, Safer methods that use cork borers.<br>
 To insert glass tubing, or a thermometer, through a stopper, if the glass tubing is not a wide bore, then select a cork borer that is just wider than the glass tubing.<br>
 Push the cork borer through the hole in the stopper using a twisting action.<br>
 For wide bore glass tubing, push a smaller size cork borer through the stopper from the opposite side.<br>
 Use the next larger size borer and push this over the cork borer already in the stopper from the other side.<br>
 Use a twisting action to push it between the cork borer already in place and the stopper.<br>
 When the correct size cork borer is in place in the stopper, slide the glass tubing or thermometer into place within the stopper.<br>
 Then pull out the cork borer with a twisting action to leave the glass tubing or the thermometer in place.<br>
 3.1 Cork stoppers should be rolled before using to make them soft so that they can be inserted into a bottle easily.<br>
 Also, it is also easier to drill a hole through a rolled stopper.<br>
 3.2 Drill a hole on a stopper.<br>
 Sharpen the edge of a drill with a steel file.<br>
 Drill with only a slight force so the drilling can be corrected in case the drilling is off the centre.<br>
 Use water as lubricant for a cork stopper and alcohol for a rubber stopper.<br>
 For cork stoppers, the drill diameter should be slightly smaller than the diameter of the glass tube that will be inserted, because the cork has poor elasticity.<br>
 For rubber stoppers, the drill diameter should be the same as the glass tube to be inserted.<br>
 3.3 Fit a glass tube through a cork.<br>
 Spread water on the surface of glass tube for lubricating.<br>
 Cover the tube with cloth or put on thick gloves to protect hands.<br>
 Insert the tube into cork with the tube tightly held to reduce the possibility of tube breaking.<br>

 Be careful! Use safety glasses and thick gloves.<br>
 Use 60 cm of 24 gauge nichrome wire, and make heat proof handles, one with a switch, for the ends.<br>
 Connect to a 12 volt 5 amp power supply, e.g. a car battery or a step-down transformer.<br>

 Use a triangular file to make a small groove on the glass jar where the nichrome wire will cross.<br>
 Adjust the wire in a loop for cutting.<br>
 Do not let the wires touch where they cross in the groove.<br>
 Switch on the electric current, and after a few seconds, the glass will usually crack in a clean cut where the wire has looped the jar.<br>
 If the glass does not crack after 15 seconds, switch off the electric current, remove the nichrome wire loop and hold the jar under running water.<br>

<a href="../images/2.25.gif">See diagram 2.25: </a> Parts of a microscope.<br>
A microscope has a heavy base to ensure stability (5).<br>
A curved frame, the limb, sits on the base and at its other end carries the tube support (6).<br>
The stage (9), is a flat surface that projects from the frame, on which the specimens are placed.<br>
At the centre of the stage is an opening for light to pass through.<br>
Two specimen clamps on the stage are for clamping microscope slides in position (3).<br>
The eyepiece lens, ocular (1), is at the upper end of the draw tube, (2), seated on the body tube support (6).<br>
The draw tube is movable, so it can be extended to the correct setting for the lens.<br>
The objectives (8), are screwed into the revolving nosepiece (7).<br>
The shorter objective contains lenses for low power magnification.<br>
The longer objectives contain lenses for high power magnification.<br>
The nosepiece can be revolved to swing the selected objective into the light path.<br>
A coarse adjustment knob and a fine adjustment knob (4), alter the distance between the specimen on the stage and the objective to focus the image.<br>
Below the stage an iris diaphragm (10), is used to control how much light passes through the specimen.<br>
In more complicated microscopes, not in the diagram, a condenser lens system under the stage can be raised or lowered to focus light on the specimen.<br>
Under the iris diaphragm is a round mirror (11).<br>
It is plane on one side and curved on the other side.<br>
It is used to direct the light path and can be turned in any direction.<br>

Soldering is used to join metallic surfaces such as copper, iron, nickel, lead, tin, zinc and aluminium for making electrical connections, joining sheet metal, sealing seams against leakage.<br>
Electric soldering irons or guns are widely used for electrical connections, but soldering may also be done with coppers that do not have an electrical heating element.<br>
Maintain the soldering iron at the appropriate temperature, because excessive heat can produce excessive lead vapour.<br>
Ensure adequate ventilation with a small electric fan.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="2.6.2H"></a>2.6.2 Solders<br>
Solder, soft Pb and Sn alloys, resin-cored solder, wire form (Soldering flux, soldering resin).<br>
Most soft solders are alloys of tin and lead.<br>
Solders used for joining aluminium are usually alloys of tin and zinc.<br>
Alloys of tin and cadmium are not used much nowadays, because cadmium is too dangerous.<br>
The melting points of most tin lead solders range from about 165<sup>o</sup>C upwards.<br>
Tin-lead solders have two numbers stamped on them to show percentage tin, then percentage lead.<br>
Solders with a high tin content are used for electrical joints.<br>
Solders with high lead content are used for greater mechanical strength.<br>
Solders with a high tin content are more expensive than solders containing much lead.<br>
Solders that contain a high percentage of tin usually have lower melting points than solders that contain a high percentage of lead.<br>
Solders are available in various forms, including bars, wires, ingots and powders.<br>
Wire solder is available with or without a flux core.<br>
Products:<br>
Solders sticks, 250 g, 50% tin / 50% lead<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="2.6.3H">2.6.3</a> Flux<br>
A flux is a substance added to lower the melting temperature in metallurgy and soldering.<br>
The fusion of metals to form alloys is often done under a flux that may promote liquefaction, prevent volatilization and unnecessary exposure to the air.<br>
1. The metal to be joined, the tip of the soldering iron and the solder must be clean.<br>
Fluxes are used to clean the joint area, to remove the oxide film that is normally present on metal, and to prevent further oxidation.<br>
Fluxes also decrease the surface tension of the solder and thus make the solder a better wetting agent.<br>
Use a flux that is suitable for the metal to be joined, as shown below.<br>
To make a good joint, the metal to be joined, the tip of the soldering iron and the solder itself must be freed of dirt, grease, oxides and other foreign matter that would prevent the solder from adhering to the metal.<br>
2. Fluxes are generally classified as corrosive, mildly corrosive and non-corrosive.<br>
The non-corrosive fluxes are used for soldering electrical connections and for other work that must be completely protected from any trace of corrosive residue.<br>
Rosin is the most commonly used non-corrosive flux.<br>
In the solid state, rosin is inactive and non-corrosive.<br>
When rosin is heated, it becomes sufficiently active to reduce the oxides on the hot metal and thus do the fluxing action.<br>
Rosin may be obtained as powder, paste, or liquid.<br>
Use rosin for soldering brass, copper, tin and lead.<br>
Use zinc chloride for soldering galvanized iron, and zinc.<br>
Use borax (hydrated sodium borate) or sal ammoniac (ammonium chloride) for soldering iron and steel.<br>
Use a special flux for soldering aluminium.<br>
3. Rosin fluxes often leave a brown stain on the soldered metal.<br>
This stain is difficult to remove, but it can be prevented to some extent by adding a small amount of turpentine to the rosin.<br>
Glycerine is sometimes added to the rosin to make the flux more effective.<br>
Rosin is a solid amber residue made by the distillation of turpentine from pine stumps.<br>
4. Lead fluxes may lead to kidney damage.<br>
Do not use fluxes containing fluoride.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="2.6.4H">2.6.4</a> Methods of soldering<br>
 1. All surfaces to be soldered must be clean and free of oxide, dirt, grease or other foreign matter.<br>
 The materials to be soldered should be joined mechanically, so the solder fixes the joint in place, just like carpenter's glue holds a woodworking joint.<br>
 2. Use a solder and flux that are appropriate for the particular job.<br>
 The melting point of the flux must be below the melting point of the particular type of solder you are going to use.<br>
 3. Heat the surfaces just enough to melt the solder.<br>
 Solder will not stick to unheated surfaces.<br>
 Do not heat the solder ed much above the working temperature, because as the temperature of molten solder increases, the rate of oxidation is increases.<br>
 When molten solder is overheated in air, more tin than lead is lost by oxidation.<br>

<a href="../images/2.32.gif">See diagram 2.32: </a> Soldering electrical connections.<br>
 Use the rosin core solder, because washing off acid flux from electrical gear is difficult.<br>
 Any acid that remains from the soldering operation causes corrosion.<br>
 To solder electrical connections, hold the soldering iron, the copper, beneath the splice being soldered, with the greatest possible area of mechanical contact to permit maximum heat transfer.<br>
 Apply the rosin core solder to the splice.<br>
 Be careful! Do not to overheat electrical components.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="2.6.6H">2.6.6</a> Torch soldering<br>
Torch soldering is often used for small jobs or for work that is relatively hard to reach.<br>
 A propane torch or an alcohol torch may be used.<br>
 The general procedure is to play the flame from the torch on to the surfaces to be joined and then apply cold solder in bar or wire form.<br>
 The heated surfaces will melt the solder.<br>
 As the solder melts, wipe off any excess solder with a damp cloth, before the solder hardens.<br>

Wire</a> Commercial<br>
Diameters of wires are measured in terms of Standard Wire Gauge, SWG (UK, Australia) or Brown and Sharpe (B &amp; S) (American Wire Gauge)<br>
SWG 50 is the smallest gauge<br>
Cable sizes are shown as follows:<br>
14/36 = 14 strands of 36 SWG wire to carry 2 amps for internal lighting in a motor car, or 61/20 = 61 strands of 20 SWG wires to carry<br>150 amps suitable for 6 volt starter motors in a car'.<br>
Wire Gauge Conversion<br>
AWG = American Wire Gauge, inches as decimals of an inch, excluding the metric numbers<br>
AWG = American Wire Gauge, Metric wire gauge is 10 times the diameter in millimetres and shown as "MM" B and S = Brown and Sharpe, inches.<br>
SWG = Imperial Standard Wire Gauge (British legal standard) inches<br>

 Activated carbon (industrial information)<br>
 (Non-SI unit "micron" = 1 micrometre)<br>
 Wood charcoal is formed by destructive distillation of wood.<br>
 Charcoals are used to purify gases and liquids, e.g. coconut shell charcoal.<br>
 Animal charcoal is made from bones and is used for sugar refining.<br>
 If more than 4000 mg per day taken as dietary supplement may cause stomach upset, diarrhoea, constipation or vomiting, blackened teeth and painful stools.<br>
 Industrial website information:<br>
 1. Activated carbon water filters are fast acting and very effective in removing unpleasant taste and odours from water.<br>
 They are made from coal, coconut, lignite and wood.<br>
 These materials are heated to extreme temperatures in the absence of oxygen, leaving millions of microscopic pores for contaminants to be absorbed.<br>
 There are three main types of carbon filters: Paper wound, Granular (GAC) Carbon Block.<br>
 The effectiveness of a carbon filter depends on the carbon used, the design and how slowly water is passed through the filter.<br>
 Cartridges are usually micron-rated and have different sediment holding capabilities.<br>
 As cartridges go from coarser to finer in their filtration rating, they become less efficient in sediment holding.<br>
 On fine or sub micron carbon filters a 5 to 3 micron sediment filter should be fitted before the carbon filter to prevent plugging.<br>
 2. Cartridge examples:<br>
 A: Matrix CTO 10 um<br>
 A high quality carbon block filter with good sediment retention and chlorine removal ability.<br>
 B: Matrix Pb1 1 um<br>
 A high quality carbon block filter with iron exchange media to reduce dissolved lead and other heavy metals.<br>
 Effective on water that has <i>Giardia</i> and <i>Cryptosporidium</i> present.<br>
 C: GAC 10 um.<br>
 A granular activated carbon filter<br>
 Offers good chlorine reduction with a good flow rate.<br>
 3. Activated carbon is also called activated charcoal and decolorizing carbon.<br>
 It is made by heating charcoal to about 930<sup>o</sup>C, where it gains a large surface area to maximize reactions with unwanted substances.<br>
 Activated carbon can be coal-based, coconut-based and lignite-based.<br>
 The activated carbon works by adsorption, i.e. substances are attached to the surface of the carbon, not absorption where substances mix with the absorbing material, e.g. a beach towel.<br>
 It can be used to absorb unburnt gases from exhausts of motor cars, colours from products and harmful gases in the air, bad tasting chemicals from water.<br>
Experiment<br>
 Put activated carbon in a filter paper in a filter funnel.<br>
 Add a few drops of difference substances to 100 mL of water and pour the solution onto the activated carbon.<br>
 Compare the colour of the original solution and the filtered solution.<br>
 The substance to be tested can include food colourings, pickle juice, vinegar, potassium permanganate (VII) crystals.<br>
