A fired artillery shell travels througha parabolic path.
The maximum range, by calculation, is when the shell is fired at an angle of 45<sup>o</sup>.<br>
However, such a calculation ignores air resistance.<br>
Air resistance may depend on other variables, e.g. the the shape of the projectile, the weight of the projectile, the direction and strength of the wind.<br>
However, air resistanc may hardly affect the maximim range of an aerodynamically-shaped artillery projectile, but the angle to achieve actual maxim distance only be determined by practice shots.
Experiment
The water stream from a hose breaks up into droplets on contact wit the air.<br>
Find the angle for maximum distance for water from a garden hose, when the water supply is partly turned on, about half turned on, fully tuned on.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="15.0.1H"></a>15.0.1 Circular motion velocity<br>
 Circular motion velocity, circular velocity, v, uniform circular motion
 in a horizontal plane a<sub>c</sub> = v<sup>2</sup>/ r = 4π<sup>2</sup>r/
 T<sup>2</sup>.<br>
 A body moving in a circular path is accelerating.<br>
 So a resultant force must reacting on it, acting towards the centre of the
circle, called the centripetal force.<br>
 F = ma, so F = mv<sup>2</sup> / r, for an object attached to a string 
whirled in a horizontal circle, the centripetal force is the tension in the 
string.<br>
 Circular motion velocity is always at a tangent to the circle.<br>
 For circular motion at constant speed, the centripetal ("centre seeking")
 acceleration vector always points towards the centre of the 
 circle.<br>
 The centripetal force keeps the object moving in the circle and the direction
 of the force is towards the centre of the circle.<br>
 Centripetal force comes from the following:<br>
 1. Gravitational force, for planets in orbit, the sun and satellites about 
 the earth<br>
 2. Tension in a string, for an object whirled in a horizontal circle<br>
 3. Electrical force, for electrons orbiting a nucleus<br>
 4. Friction, for a car turning<br>
 5. Air pressure, for an aircraft turning in a horizontal circle.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="15.0.2H"></a>15.0.2 Amplitude, A and period, 
 T<br>
 An oscillation or cycle is one complete to and fro movement of a vibrating
 object.<br>
 The maximum displacement of the vibrating object from its rest or equilibrium
 position is called the amplitude of the oscillation, with 
 symbol A.<br>
 For any particular vibration, the time for one complete oscillation is called
its period, with symbol T.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="15.0.3H"></a>15.0.3 Frequency, f, simple 
 harmonic motion<br>
 The number of oscillations or cycles in one second is called its frequency, 
 f.<br>
 The relationship between the period and frequency of an oscillating object: 
 T = 1/ f.<br>
 An oscillation may be very complicated, including more than one frequency.<br>
 So the oscillation of interest may comprise other oscillations.<br>
 If the oscillation can be described by a harmonic function with a single
 frequency, it is called simple harmonic oscillation.<br>
 An object moving at a constant speed in a circular path is undergoing 
uniform circular motion.<br>
 Calculate the speed or linear velocity of the object by dividing the length 
 of the object's path by the time taken to complete the path.<br>
 For a complete circle the time taken is called the period, T.<br>
 Linear velocity (tangential velocity), v = 2 π r/ T, where r = radius of the circle and T is the time period for one revolution with unit ms<sup>-1</sup>, and is always at a tangent to the circle.<br>
Simple harmonic motion is symmetrical oscillatory motion under a retarding force proportional to the displacement from the equilibrium position, e.g. the projection of uniform motion in a circle, circular motion, on to a diameter.<br>

θ (theta) = S/r = 2πr/r = 2π rad<br>

θ = S/r = vt/r<br>
ω = θ/t = v/r<br>
v = θ r<br>
1 rpm = 1 rev/min X 2pi rad/rev X 1/60 sec/min = 0.105 rad /sec<br>
An LP record spins at 331/3 X 0.105 = 3.5 rad/sec<br>
 1. For an object moving in a circle, its speed around the circle, v = 2π r / T, where r = radius of the circle and T = time taken for one revolution.<br>
 2. The angular displacement of the object, ∆θ, is measured in radians, rad.<br>
 A radian is the angle subtended at the centre of a circle by an arc equal to the radius of the circle.<br>
 1 revolution, rev = 360<sup>o</sup> = 2π radians, rad, so 1 rad = 360<sup>o</sup> / 2π = 57.272727' = 57.30<sup>o</sup>.<br>
 Similarly, 1<sup>o</sup> = 0.01745 rad and 1 revolution per minute, 1 rpm = 0.105 rad/ sec.<br>
 3. Angular velocity, ω, = ∆θ / ∆t, radians per second, rad / s, where ω = change in angular position of the object / time, ∆θ = angular displacement, and ∆t = time taken.<br>
(So linear velocity = m / s, and angular velocity = rad / s.)<br>
 4. The tangential velocity of an object moving with uniform circular motion is the ratio of its linear speed and the radius of its path, so v = ωr, where ω is expressed in radians, and time for one revolution, T = 2π / ω.<br>
 5. A 12 inch (12 × 2.54 cm = 30.48 cm) record turntable, radius of revolution, gramophone record rotates at 331/3 revolutions per minute, rpm = 3.49 rad / sec.<br>
 6. If a CD, compact disc rotates at 22.0 rad /s its angular speed = 210 rpm.<br>
 7. The earth spins once in 24 hours, 86, 400 seconds, so angular velocity = 4.16 × 10<sup>3</sup> degrees per second, i.e. 7 × 10<sup>-5</sup> rad / s.<br>
 <a href="../images/15.0.4.1.gif">See diagram 15.0.4.1</a>: Axis of rotation of the Earth.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="15.0.4.1H"></a>15.0.4.1 Axis of rotation<br>
 The axis of rotation of an object is a line of particles, or imaginary particles, that do not move.<br>
 All other particles in the body move in a circle, V = ω, so the further particles are from the axis of rotation the faster they move, although they all have the same angular velocity.<br>
 A point on the rim of a gramophone record rotating at 331 / 3 rpm moves with velocity, v = ω r = 3.50 rad/ sec × 0.5 × 30.48 = 53.34 cm/ sec.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="15.0.5H"></a>15.0.5 Centripetal acceleration, a<sub>c</sub><br>
 An object undergoing uniform circular motion is constantly changing direction, so it is accelerating.<br>
 If the object is moving with constant speed the direction of acceleration is towards the axis of rotation, i.e. centre of the circular path.<br>
 This acceleration is called centripetal acceleration, a<sub>c </sub>= v<sup>2</sup>/ r, where r = radius and v = tangential velocity around the circle = 4<nobr>π</nobr><sup>2</sup>r/ T<sup>2</sup>.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="15.0.6H"></a>15.0.6 Centripetal force, F<sub>c</sub><br>
Newton's First Law states that an object at rest or at constant velocity will remain in that state unless acted upon by an external force.<br>
An object in circular motion, at constant speed v, must have a force acting on it to keep it in a circular path.<br>
This centripetal force can be expressed as a form of Newton's Second Law, F = ma, i.e. F<sub>c</sub> = mv<sup>2</sup> / r = m4<nobr>π</nobr><sup>2</sup>r/ 
T<sup>2</sup>.<br>
When you observe an object undergoing uniform circular motion from a position either above or below the object's path, you see the circular path.<br>
However, when the object is observed from a position in the same plane as the circular path, you see the object moving back and forth in an oscillatory motion that corresponds with the simple harmonic motion.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="15.0.1.1H"></a>15.0.1.1 Circle from straight lines<br>

 Put the rectangle on a piece of paper on the desk.<br>
 Push a drawing pin (thumb tack) through the centre of the cardboard rectangle.<br>
 Move the cardboard from place to place drawing a line along the end of
 the ruler at each place.<br>
 Draw a dot where the lines cross.<br>
 Join the dots to draw a circle<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="15.1.01H"></a>15.1.01 Pendulum, oscillations<br>
 A simple pendulum is a mechanical system that displays oscillatory motion.<br>
 It consists of a mass, called a bob, suspended by a light cord that does 
 not stretch.<br>
 For angles &lt; 20<sup>o</sup>, the period of oscillation is dependent 
only on the length of the cord.<br>
 T = 2<nobr> π </nobr> l / g, where l is the length of the pendulum and g
is gravitational acceleration.<br>
 The period is independent of the mass of the bob.<br>
 Pendulums are used as timekeepers and to measure the acceleration due 
to gravity.<br>
 Period = 1/ frequency, Hertz, Hz, or cycles per second, cps.<br>
 The period, T, of a simple pendulum depends on its length, l, and the 
acceleration of a falling object, g.<br>
 T = 2<nobr>π</nobr> (l / g).<br>
 The period, T, is not affected by the angular amplitude, or the mass of 
 the pendulum bob, m.<br>
 The simple pendulum does not display simple harmonic motion precisely 
and therefore is dependent on the angular amplitude.<br>
 However, for angles less than 20<sup>o</sup> the dependence on angular 
amplitude can be ignored.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="15.1.02H"></a>15.1.02 Pendulum swinging
 at the equator<br>
 A pendulum swings slower at the equator for two reasons:<br>
 1. A "centrifugal" force of rω<sup>2 </sup>from the Earth's rotation decreases the acceleration by 0.034 m /s<sup>2</sup>, but this does not occur at the north 
 pole and south pole.<br>
 2. The Earth bulges at the equator, so any place there is further from the centre of the Earth.<br>
 Consequently, the earth's gravitational acceleration is 9.780 m / s<sup>2</sup> at the equator, about 0.052 m / s<sup>2</sup> less than at the north pole and south pole, i.e. 0.53% less gravitational acceleration.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="15.1.1H"></a> 15.1.1 Simple pendulum<br>
<a href="../images/15.1.1.gif">See diagram 15.1.1</a>: Pendulum calculation.<br>
 A ceiling hook can be used to support a pendulum.<br>
1. Tie a 2 m string to a heavy object.<br>
 Swing the pendulum bob through a small angle, &lt; 20<sup>o</sup>, between 
 the pendulum and a vertical line at the bottom of the swing.<br>
 Count the number of swings per minute.<br>
 Each swing starts and finishes when the bob passes the rest position in 
 the same direction.<br>
 Swing the pendulum bob through a smaller arc.<br>
 Count the number of swings per minute.<br>
 The size of the arc does not affect the time of vibration of a pendulum.<br>
 The angular amplitude does not affect the period if the pendulum bob swings 
 through a small angle.<br>
2. Use the same 2 m pendulum, but change the weight of the bob.<br>
 Count the number of swings per minute.<br>
 The change in weight does not affect the time of oscillation of the pendulum.<br>
 The mass of the pendulum bob does not affect the period.<br>
3. Change the length of the pendulum to two metres.
 Count the number of swings per minute.<br>
 The number of swings per minute increases.<br>
 The length of the pendulum affects the time of oscillation of the pendulum.<br>
4. Measure the time taken for 25 oscillations through
 the same small angle for pendulum length, l = 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.00 
 m.<br>
 Calculate the time for one swing, T, for each length.<br>
 Assume the square roots of length, l, are 0.5, 0.71, 0.87 and 1 m.<br>
 Draw a graph to plot T against length, l.<br>
 If the graph line is a straight line, then T is proportional to the square
 root of length l.<br>
 The period, T, is the time taken to complete on one complete oscillation, 
 forwards and backwards.<br>
 Period, T = 1/ frequency, f (expressed in hertz, Hz, cycles per second, 
 cps) (Heinrich Hertz 1857 - 1894).<br>
 The period, T, of a simple pendulum depends on its length, l, and the acceleration, because of gravity (acceleration of free fall)<br>
 g = 9.8 m/ sec<sup>2 </sup>T = 2 × π × (l / g).<br>
 If the period, T = 1 second, T = 2 × π × (l/ g) l = g × T<sup>2</sup>/ 4 × π<sup>2</sup>, so length, l = 0.25 m.<br>
 A simple pendulum, length 25 cm, swings through one complete cycle every 
 second.<br>
Simple harmonic motion refers to movement of equal distance each side of a central point with acceleration towards the central point and proportional to the distance to it.<br>
The bob moves with simple harmonic motion, because the force on the bob at any point is proportional to its displacement from its mean position and is directed towards it.<br>
5. Tie a two metre long string to a heavy object.
 Swing the pendulum bob through a maximum angle of 20<sup>o </sup>between
 the pendulum 
 and a vertical line at the bottom of the swing.<br>
 Count the number of swings per minute.<br>
* Swing the pendulum bob through a smaller arc.<br>
 Count the number of swings per minute.<br>
 Note that the length of the arc does not affect the time of vibration 
of a pendulum.<br>
* Keep the length of the pendulum the same, but change the weight of the
bob.<br>
 Count the number of swings per minute.<br>
 Note that the change in weight does not affect the time of oscillation 
of the pendulum.<br>
* Make the pendulum one metre long.<br>
 Count the number of swings per minute.<br>
 The number of swings per minute increases.<br>
 The length of the pendulum does affect the time of oscillation of the 
pendulum.<br>
6. To verify the relationship between period of
 a simple pendulum and 1. angle of the swing, 2. mass of the pendulum bob, 
 and 3. length of the pendulum.<br>
 The period is the time for a complete cycle of motion, i.e. forwards then 
 back to where it started from.<br>
 The angle of the swing is the angle between its farthest position from
 the vertical and the vertical.<br>
 The length is the distance from the centre of the spherical bob and the
 point of suspension.<br>
7. Use about 2 metres of fishing line or thread.
 Tie one end to a heavy circular bob.<br>
 Wind the other end around a metal cylinder.<br>
 Clamp the cylinder horizontally.<br>
 Turn the cylinder so that the length of the pendulum is exactly 1 metre.<br>
 Draw back the bob 10<sup>o</sup> and set the pendulum in motion.<br>
 Time how long it takes for the pendulum to complete 10 oscillations.<br>
 Calculate and record the period.<br>
 Pull the bob 20<sup>o </sup>and calculate the period.<br>
 Let the pendulum swing in a smaller arc by drawing the bob back 5<sup>o
 </sup>and calculate the period.<br>
 Note that the period is the same in each case, thus period is not dependent
 on size of swing.<br>
8. Exchange the bob with another of different mass
 and repeat the procedure.<br>
 Observe that the period is the same.<br>
 The period is not dependent on the mass of the bob.<br>
 Construct a pendulum 2m long.<br>
 Using a protractor, draw back the bob 15<sup>o</sup>, release the bob 
and calculate the period.<br>
 Now reduce the length of the pendulum by 50 cm and repeat the procedure 
 and calculate the period.<br>
 Repeat this procedure reducing the length of the pendulum each time.<br>
 Calculate 2 π × l/ g.<br>

 1. Demonstrate the transfer of energy in a weakly coupled system.<br>
Fill two same size bottles with water, add stoppers and suspend the bottles with same size string, as pendulums from a rod.<br>
The strings must be the same length.<br>
Hold one bottle still, start the other bottle swinging, then release the first bottle.<br>
 Soon the swinging pendulum slows, and the other pendulum takes up the swing.<br>
Hang the pendulums from a stationary support such as a doorway, but join the pendulum cords with a third string tied between them about one eighth of the way down the cords.<br>
2. To observe the energy transfer of a simple pendulum 
 use two full identical bottles, several pieces of string, a stick, and 
two chairs.<br>
 Fill the two bottles with water or sand.<br>
 Put the chairs back to back.<br>
 Lay the stick across the backs of the chairs.<br>
 Cut two pieces of string with the same length.<br>
 Tie the bottlenecks with string then hang the bottles from the stick.<br>
 When the bottles are at rest, hold the first bottle and draw back the 
second bottle.<br>
 Let the second bottle swing in the plane upright to the stick.<br>
 Let the first bottle go, then observe the movement of the two bottles.<br>
 The amplitude of the second bottle will decrease gradually.<br>
 The first bottle will gradually swing from rest and its amplitude will
 increase gradually.<br>
 Finally the two bottles will swing with the same amplitude and velocity.<br>

 Study how the time taken for energy transfer between pendulums depends on 1. the distance between hanging points of the pendulums and 2. the length of the pendulums.<br>
 Suspend a 100 cm strong string between two stands.<br>
 Attach two threads 2.5 cm each side of the centre of the strong string.<br>
 Attach 100 g weights to the end of each thread so that the length of the

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="15.1.29H"></a>15.1.29 Galileo's pendulum, 
 stopped pendulum, conservation of mechanical energy<br>
<a href="../images/15.1.20.gif">See diagram 15.1.20</a>, Galileo's pendulum.<br>
In about 1602, Galileo Galilei while observing the oscillation of a hanging lamp in the cathedral of Pisa and comparing it with his pulse, discovered the isochronism of the pendulum, i.e. the period of the swing is independent of the amplitude.<br>
This principle became the standard mechanism for clocks.<br>
If Galileo Galilei had the patience to sit in the cathedral of Pisa for 24 hours, he would have done the experiment of 15.1.30 Foucault pendulum!<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Experiments<br>
 1. Suspend a 5 cm diameter wooden ball by a 100 cm fine thread from a nail
in the wall or from a nail above the blackboard.<br>
 Draw a horizontal line CD 50 cm above the wooden ball such that the wooden
 ball can swing from C to D.<br>
 Release the wooden ball at C so that it swings through the arc CBD to reach
D.<br>
 The momentum at B carries the wooden ball through the arc BD to the horizontal
 CD.<br>
 In fact the ball does not quite reach the horizontal CD, because some energy 
 is lost due to resistance of the air and the string.<br>
 2. Place a peg as a stop at some position E between the nail and CD.<br>
 Release the wooden ball at C.<br>
 The ball again travels through arc CB, hits the peg E then travels though 
 arc E E1 reaching the same height as CD.<br>
 3. Replace peg E with peg F between E and level CD.<br>
 Release the wooden ball at C.<br>
 The ball again travels through arc CB, hits peg F then travels through 
arc FF1 reaching the same height as CD.<br>
 4. Replace peg F with peg G such that the remainder of the thread below
 G cannot reach level CD.<br>
 Release the wooden ball at C.<br>
 The thread leaps over peg G and twists around it.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="15.1.30H"></a>15.1.30 Foucault pendulum<br>
<a href="../images/36.87.gif">See diagram 36.87</a>: G-clamp support to allow pendulum to swing in any direction.<br>
 In 1851, Léon Foucault hung a heavy brass ball from a long wire attached to the inside of the dome of the Pantheon in Paris and set it in motion in one direction as a pendulum.<br>
He showed that the earth rotates once each day, because while the direction of swing of the pendulum does not change the surroundings do change their position due to the rotation of the earth.<br>
 As the pendulum swings, the Earth rotates beneath it, so the plane of the
swing appears to rotate.<br>
Experiments<br>
1. Use a G-clamp with a ball bearing soldered to 
 the inside of the jaw to makes a good support for the pendulum.<br>
 Hang the pendulum indoors with the ball bearing resting on a razor blade 
 or another hard surface.<br>
 Use nylon fishing line to suspend the bob.<br>
 The bob can be a solid rubber ball, but for best results use a bob &gt; 
 5 kg.<br>
 For a pointer, use a short knitting needle pushed into the bob and continuous 
 with the suspending fishing line.<br>
 The pointer should just touch a reference line drawn in fine sand in a tray
on the floor.<br>
 The length of the pendulum at least 3 m long.<br>
 The pendulum must swing freely so that it swings backwards and forwards 
 in the same plane.<br>
 However, it appears to change its path during the day.<br>
2. To set the pendulum in motion, attach a long 
 cotton thread to a drawing pin pushed into the bob.<br>
 Align the thread along the direction of the reference line, then burn 
the thread near the drawing pin.<br>
 After the pendulum is set in motion note that the plane of the swing has 
 changed after a few hours compared with the reference line.<br>
 If the ceiling-mounted pendulum swings freely, note the change in the 
path of the pendulum after one hour.<br>
 Then note the plane of swing at six × ten minute intervals.<br>
 A pendulum releasing ink can mark a clear pattern.<br>
 Getting good quantitative results without many refinements is not easy, but observing the effect is not difficult.<br>
3. Note the variation of rotation of the Foucault 
 pendulum with latitude.<br>
 The Earth rotating beneath the bob causes the change.<br>
 The precession period for an ideal pendulum is 23.93 hours / sine of the 
 latitude.<br>
 For example, at Sydney, Australia, at latitude 34<sup>o</sup> S, the period 
 is about 43 hours, i.e. about one degree every seven minutes.<br>
 At the south pole the pendulum precesses through 360<sup>o</sup> in a day.<br>
 At the equator the pendulum does not precess.<br>
4. If a pendulum is started swinging along the north-south direction, and below it a model of the Earth and the and pendulum is slowly rotated in a counter clockwise direction.<br>
The pendulum continues its swing along the North-South direction until after the earth model has been rotated by 90<sup>o</sup>.<br>
On the equator, the pendulum does not precess.<br>
At intermediate latitudes the period = 23.93 hours / sine of the latitude, e.g. at Sydney's latitude of 34 degrees S, the period = about 43 hours, so the precession rate = about 1<sup>o</sup> every 7 minutes.<br>
 It is easy to deal with this misunderstanding.<br>
The plane of a pendulum at the equator, swinging in a North South plane, does not rotate with respect to the earth.<br>
 Relative to an inertial frame, it rotates once every 24 hours.<br>
Only at the north and south poles, does the pendulum swing in a plane fixed with respect to the distant stars while the Earth rotates beneath it, but not at all other latitudes, where the plane of the pendulum's motion rotates with respect to an inertial frame.<br>
 At these other latitudes, the plane of the pendulum's swing is not fixed in space.<br>
5. Construct a miniature Foucault pendulum<br>
 Mount a small Foucault pendulum from a stand set upon a turntable or office 
 chair that can be rotated.<br>
 Observe the behaviour of the pendulum when the turntable is rotated slowly.<br>
 Note that the plane of motion of the simple Foucault pendulum remains 
stationary as the support is rotated.<br>
 Set the pendulum into oscillations, then note and mark its plane of oscillation.<br>
 While the pendulum is still swinging, rotate its support frame.<br>
 The pendulum continues to oscillate in the original plane.<br>
 This demonstration simulates a pendulum oscillating above the poles of the
Earth.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="15.2.01H"></a>15.2.01 Centripetal force and 
 centrifugal motion<br>
 When an object is travelling in uniform circular motion at a constant 
speed it is still accelerating.<br>
 The direction of the velocity changes, so there is an acceleration, called 
 centripetal acceleration.<br>
 Centripetal force keeps an object in a circular path and changes the direction 
 of the velocity towards the centre of the circle.<br>
 Centripetal force, F = mv<sup>2</sup> / r, m = mass of the object, r = radius
of the circle, v = linear, i.e. tangential velocity.<br>
 The centripetal force keeping the earth in its orbit around the sun is
 the gravitational force.<br>
 The centripetal force keeping an object sitting on a rotating turntable 
 is friction.<br>
 If you stand on a rotating platform you feel as if you are being forced
 in a direction away from the centre of the circle.<br>
 This is called "centrifugal force", but it is the result of inertia.<br>
 Your body would like to travel in a straight line according to Newton's 
 First Law.<br>
 As the platform floor accelerates towards the centre and you try to continue on your straight line motion, it feels as if a force pushes you to the outside.<br>
 However, there is no force.<br>
 Centrifugal force is a "fictitious" force that is observed from within
 accelerating frames of reference.<br>
 Of course as centripetal force disappears, the object will move along a
path that is tangent of the circle at the point where the 
 centripetal force vanished.<br>
 A simple pendulum consists of a cord whose mass can be ignored and a ball 
 whose volume is very small called a "bob".<br>
 When the swinging angle is less than 5<sup>o</sup>, the simple pendulum
 moves with a constant period, T.<br>
 T is not affected by the mass of the bob.<br>
 T = 2π × ( l/ g) where l = length of the cord and g = acceleration of gravity.<br>

 2. Half fill a bucket with water.<br>
 Swing the bucket forwards and backwards.<br>
 The water "climbs up" the side of the bucket due to its inertia.<br>

 4. Grasp a plastic cup full of water with your palm facing away from you.<br>

 Keep swinging your arm, but slow the swing until you stop the swing and place
the plastic cup on the table with no water spilled out.<br>

 Grip the tube as a handle and swing it in a small circle above your head

 The force of gravity on the washers provides the horizontal force needed
 to keep the stopper moving in a circle.<br>
 Attach a clip to the string below the tube.<br>
 Swing the tube such that the level of the clip remains constant and so the circular motion is 
 constant.<br>
 To find the frequency, record the number of revolutions per minute.<br>
 Record the number of washers when the stopper moves in a path of radius

 Hook the hanger over your finger.<br>

 Twirl the coat hanger around your finger and the coin does not fly off.<br>
 OR<br>
 Pull the middle of the longest straight part of a wire coat hanger out and
shape it into a long narrow shape.<br>
 Use a file to flatten the end of the hook.<br>
 Let the hanger hang on your index finger and place a coin on the filed
 end of the wire.<br>
 Start to swing the hanger.<br>
 Swing slowly at first back and forth, and then do full loops.<br>
 Swing it slower when ending the swing and try to catch the coin when it 
 falls off the end of the hanger.<br>
 The spinning of the penny gives it a "centrifugal force" holding the coin 
 against the end of the hanger.<br>
 The faster the spinning, the larger this centrifugal force; the slower
 the spinning, the smaller the force.<br>
 The force keeps the coin up against the hanger until the circular motion
 is too slow.<br>
 Centrifugal forces are applied in the automatic cloth washer, where the drum filled with clothes and water spins fast to separate the water from the clothes.<br>
 The tendency to stay moving in a straight line causes this force of inertia 
 or centrifugal force.<br>
 [This experiment may need some practice before demonstrating to a class].<br>

<a href="../images/15.2.2.gif">See diagram 15.2.2</a>: Whirling stopper.<br>
 1. Research the relationship among the centripetal force, frequency and 
 radius of uniform circular motion.<br>
 Use a 15 cm length of glass, inner diameter 1 cm.<br>
 Burn its end over Bunsen burner into round and smooth.<br>
 Twine two layers plastic adhesive tape or list on the surface of the glass to prevent the glass slip from your hand.<br>
 Use a piece of nylon fish line.<br>
 Use one end of the fishing line to tie a rubber stopper with two holes.<br>
 Let the fishing line go through the two holes and make a tie at the centre
 of the stopper.<br>
 Let the other end of the fishing line go through the glass then hang 6 iron
gaskets, outer diameter 1 cm or 2 nuts, M10, and finally tie 
 the line in a knot.<br>
 Let a clip go through the last tie to prevent the gaskets slipping away.<br>
 Adjust the length of the line, from the rubber stopper to the top of the 
 glass, to 1 m.<br>
 Now hold the glass and on its top swing the rubber stopper in a level circle.<br>
 Here centripetal force keeping the stopper moving in a circular motion
 is the line's strain.<br>
 The force is caused by the weight of gaskets or nuts.<br>
 You may need to practice several times before demonstrating this experiment.<br>
 Record the amount of the original gaskets and the frequency of the uniform 
 rotation.<br>
 Change the length of the level line so that the rotating radius goes up 
 0.5 times of the original size at first then down 0.5 times.<br>
 Differently count the time of the rotations per minute then exchange into 
 frequency and record.<br>
 You will find how the centripetal force affects the frequency of the rotation.<br>
2. Use a metal or wooden tube about 15 cm long.
 Tie a two holed rubber stopper to the end of 1.5 m of string.<br>
 Pass the other end of the string through the tube and attach iron washers for weights.<br>
 Adjust the string so that the distance from the top of the tube to the cork is 1 m.<br>
 Grip the tube as a handle and swing it in a small circle above your head 
 so that the rubber stopper moves in a horizontal circle.<br>
 The force of gravity on the washers provides the horizontal force needed
 to keep the stopper moving in a circle.<br>
 Attach a clip to the string below the tube.<br>
 Swing the tube such that the level of the clip remains constant and so

 1 m at constant revolutions per unit time.<br>

<a href="../images/15.2.2.gif">See diagram 15.2.3</a>: Whirling fish bowl.<br>
 1. Tie a wire securely around the neck of a plastic goldfish bowl.<br>
 Attach a string to the wire.<br>
 Clamp a hook in a hand drill chuck and attach it in the centre of the 
string.<br>
 Put water coloured with ink in the bowl. Put a plastic "fish" in the bowl.<br>
 Turn the drill handle to spin the bowl and water or whirl the bowl around 
 you by hand.<br>
 The water begins to climb up the sides of the bowl, because of the "centrifugal
 force" on the water, not the centripetal force on the water.<br>
 Note the effects of inertia of the water when starting and stopping spinning 
 the bowl.<br>
 When starting spinning, the water tends to remain stationary.<br>
 When stopping spinning, the water tends to continue spinning inside the 
 bowl.<br>
2. Observe liquid's circular motion and related phenomena.<br>
 Use a small plastic goldfish bowl or the lower part of a plastic drink
 bottle with two holes drilled each side of the rim.<br>
 Fasten a 1 m piece of string to the rim then hang it on the end of a spoon.<br>
 Fill it to 1/ 3 with water containing tea and tea leaves.<br>
 Hold the jar to make it immovable and twist the spoon in a level plane
 to make the strings twist together.<br>
 Raise the spoon to raise the bowl above the ground or table then take 
your hand off the jar.<br>
 Observe the rotation of the bowl and the rotation of the tea and the tea 
 leave in the bowl.<br>
 The tea rises close to the side of the bowl.<br>
 Do the experiment again after the water is rest completely.<br>
 This time mostly observe the water's movement when the jar just begins
 to rotate and just stops.<br>
 Do the experiment once again.<br>
 When the jar rotates fastest brake it with your hands.<br>
 Observe the water's movement this time.<br>

<a href="../images/15.2.2.gif">See diagram 15.2.4</a>: Whirling clothes dryer.<br>
 Make a clothes dryer.<br>
 Use an empty container such as a can without lid or the bottom half of a
plastic drink bottle cut horizontally.<br>
 Punch several holes around the container, then punch three holes equidistant
 from each other around the top of the container to 
 suspend it with a thread.<br>
 Place wet clothes in the container and make sure that the whole container is in a state of even mass distribution.<br>
 Spin the container slowly in one direction to make thread gradually turn 
 around.<br>
 Remove your hand suddenly, the container can spin rapidly and you will
 find that water is thrown from the container.<br>
 As the container spins rapidly, the adhesive force between water drop and clothes is smaller than centripetal force that water drop needed to move in a circular line.<br>
 Then water drop leave the clothes to do centrifugal motion.<br>
 As a result, it is thrown out from the clothes.<br>
 The household dryers are made according to the principle.<br>
 Note what relationships between the speed of spinning of the container
 and the amount of the water.<br>
 To strengthen the effect of the experiment, you may add more water.<br>

 1. Almost fill a small bucket with water.<br>
 Swing it around rapidly at arm's length in a vertical circle just fast
 enough so that the water doesn't spill out.<br>
 The water does not spill, because centrifugal, not centripetal, force acts 
 on the water to keep it in the bucket.<br>
 2. Half fill a bucket with water.<br>
 Swing the bucket forwards and backwards.<br>
 The water "climbs up" the side of the bucket due to its inertia.<br>
 3. Half fill a plastic bucket with water.<br>
 Hold it by the handle and swing the bucket in a vertical circle.<br>
 If you swing fast enough the water does not spill out, because the water
 is pressing against the bottom of the bucket.<br>
 Keep swing and then let go the handle.<br>
 The bucket and water moves at a tangent to the direction of spin.<br>
 This action is the same as throwing a stone with a sling shot or throwing
 a lasso to land over the head of a runaway cow.<br>

 If you jerk your arm or stop the swing the water spills out.<br>
 Keep swinging your arm, but slow the swing until you gently stop the swing
 and place the plastic cup on the table with no water spilled 
 out.<br>
 10. Swing a lighted lantern forwards and backwards the flame pointed to the direction of movement, because the heavier air around the lighter flame is left behind due to its inertia.<br>

 Rotational kinetic energy<br>
 v = ω r, so for particle mass m, KE = mv<sup>2</sup> = mω<sup>2</sup>r<sup>2</sup>, so for all particles in an object.<br>
 (All particles in the object have the same angular velocity.)<br>
 KE sum of mv<sup>2</sup> = × (sum of m × r<sup>2</sup>) × ω<sup>2</sup>.<br>
 Moment of inertia of object, I = sum of m × r<sup>2</sup> (Moment of inertia is a sort of rotational analogue of mass.)<br>
 KE of object, moment of inertia I, rotating with angular velocity ω, = Iω<sup>2</sup>.<br>
 In theory, for particles m1, m2 and m3 at radius r1, r2, r3 in an object, I = sum of m × r<sup>2</sup> = m1 × r1<sup>2</sup> + m2 × r2<sup>2</sup> + m3 × r3<sup>2</sup>.kg m<sup>2</sup>.<br>

kinetic energy of the earth<br>
<a href="../images/15.3.0.1.gif">See diagram: 15.3.0.1</a>: Moments of inertia of bodies about axes.<br>
 Mass of the earth = 6 × 10<sup>24</sup> kg.<br>
 Radius of earth = 6.4 × 10<sup>6</sup> metres.<br>
 If earth is a sphere, I = 2 / 5 MR<sup>2</sup> = 2 / 5 (6 × 10<sup>24</sup>)
 × (6.4 × 10<sup>6</sup>) = 9.8 × 10<sup>37</sup> kg.m<sup>2</sup>.<br>
 Angular velocity of earth = 7.3 × 10<sup>-5</sup> rad/ sec (one rotation per day).<br>
 Rotational kinetic energy, KE (Earth turns around its axis.) = Iω<sup>2</sup>
 = × 9.8 × 10<sup>37 </sup>× 7.3 × 10<sup>-5</sup> = 2.6 × 10<sup>29</sup>j.<br>
 Translational kinetic energy, KE<br>
 (Earth revolves around the sun at average orbital speed = 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>

 KE = × m × v<sup>2</sup> = × 6 × 10<sup>24</sup> × (3 × 10<sup>4</sup>)<sup>2</sup>

 PE = KE, mgh = mv<sup>2</sup> (translational kinetic energy at the bottom), 
 so v = 2gh.<br>
 2. The cylinder rolls down the slope.<br>
 Moment of inertia of cylinder that rolls and does not slip = I = × m ×
 R2. Angular velocity ω = v/ R, so ω<sup>2</sup> = v<sup>2</sup> / R<sup>2</sup>.<br>
 PE = KE, so mgh = mv<sup>2 </sup>(translational kinetic energy at the

 acceleration, line of action of a force, centre of gravity<br>
<a href="../images/15.3.0.gif">See diagram 15.3.0</a>: Torque.<br>
 A force f acts on an object mass m attached to the end of a string and moving
in a circular path.<br>
 F = ma, and angular acceleration, α = a/ r, so F = m × r × α, and multiplying
 both sides of the equation by r: Fr = m × r<sup>2</sup> × α.<br>
 Fr = torque = τ of the force F about the axis of the particle's rotation and its moment of inertia, I, = mr<sup>2</sup>.<br>
 So torque = I × α (analogous to F = Ma).<br>
 Angular acceleration, α is proportional to the torque and inversely proportional to the moment of inertia of the object.<br>
 When a force acts on an object such that the line of action of the force passes through the centre of gravity of the object, the object will accelerate according to f = ma.<br>
 However, if the line of action of the force is not through the centre 
of gravity, the object will have both linear and angular acceleration.<br>

Angular momentum, L = I × ω.<br>
 When there is no net torque on an object its angular velocity and angular
 momentum are constant.<br>
 Conservation of angular momentum:<br>
 When the sum of torques acting on an object = 0, the angular momentum 
is constant.<br>
 The greater the value of angular momentum, the more torque is needed to 
 change its direction so bullets, rockets and even footballs 
 can be aimed more accurate if spin stabilized.<br>
 Similarly, a spinning top stays upright until friction causes it to lose 
 angular momentum.<br>
 An ice skater can start a spin on one toe with one leg extended and both arms extended (I is large and ω is small), but when the ice skater brings both legs and both arms together (now I is small and ω is large) the skater spins much faster due to conservation of angular momentum.<br>
 Angular momentum of the earth = moment of inertia × angular velocity = (1 × 10<sup>38</sup>) × (7 × 10<sup>-5</sup>) = 7 × 10<sup>33</sup> newton 
metre (Nm).<br>

 3.1.2 Greatest height<br>
 (v<sup>2</sup> = u<sup>2</sup> + 2as), 0 = (v<sup>2</sup>sin<sup>2</sup>

 3.2.0 Horizontal motion (horizontal distance, s = range)<br>
 3.2.1 Range = (v cos θ × 2t) = (2v<sup>2</sup> cos θ sin θ/ g) = (v<sup>2</sup>
 sin 2θ / g).<br>
 3.2.2 Maximum range<br>
 The sin of an angle is not &gt; 1, so maximum range is possible only when 
 2 θ = 1, i.e. 2 θ = 90<sup>o</sup>, and θ = 45<sup>o</sup>.<br>
 So maximum range = (v<sup>2</sup>/ g), where v = initial velocity of projection.<br>

an inertia force<br>
 Observe the motion in a spinning frame of reference from a static frame
 of reference.<br>
 Coriolis force is a kind of inertia force, i.e. caused by non-inertial 
system.<br>
For an observer who stand in a frame of reference, spinning at angular speed sa, the object that is moving relative to the frame will be acted by, not only an inertial centrifugal force, but also an inertial force that makes the object not to leave the motion orbit, i.e. Coriolis force.<br>
The direction of the Coriolis force depends on cross product of the speed vector V, relative to the spinning frame and angular speed of the frame itself, always vertical to V and opposite to acceleration of tangent direction.<br>
 The magnitude of the Coriolis force is 2mVsa.<br>
 Due to the spinning of the earth, the moving object relative to earth is
seen acted by a Coriolis force by an observer on earth.<br>
 Many phenomena on the ground and in the air in nature are caused by it.<br>
The cold air in high latitude of north, south sphere drops, due to the spinning of the earth, forms a southeast and northeast wind in each sphere.<br>
 Due to the air of the equator rises, the two winds can meet near the equator 
 to form a typhoon in the region of south Pacific Ocean.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="15.8.3.6H"></a>15.8.3.6 Chalk line on a turntable<br>
The Coriolis force operates independently of the direction in which an object is travelling.<br>
In demonstrations where you draw a line radially across a slowly spinning turntable, it works only when the line is drawn towards or away from the centre.<br>
In the demonstration a chalk line is drawn radially on a slowly spinning turntable.<br>
The track of the chalk is a straight line, but the line drawn on the turntable is curved.<br>
In the inertial frame of the classroom, the track was straight, while in the rotating frame of the turntable the track is curved.<br>
It is easy to draw the line radially, but very hard to match the velocities of the turntable and chalk closely enough by hand to draw a similar line tangentially.<br>
