Cathode ray tube CRT, cathode ray oscilloscope CRO<br>
<a href="../images/38.1.11.gif">See diagram: 38.1.11:</a> Cathode ray oscilloscope CRO.<br>
<a href="../images/38.1.11a.gif">See diagram 38.1.11a</a>: Johnson cathode ray tube.<br>
<a href="../images/38.1.11b.gif">See diagram 38.1.11b</a>: Cathode ray tube.<br>
<a href="../images/38.1.12a.gif">See diagram 38.1.12</a>: Simple discharge tube.<br>
 A cathode ray is a beam of electrons coming from the cathode (negative electrode), of a vacuum tube.<br> 
 In a cathode ray tube, the cathode rays cause a luminous image on a fluorescent screen.<br> 
 The CRO measures constant and varying voltage, both.<br> 
 It consists of a cathode ray tube and control circuits.<br> 
 An electrically heated cathode gives off negative charged electrons that are accelerated towards a positive anode by a large voltage.<br> 
 Electrodes between the cathode and anode control the intensity and focussing of the electrons, that pass through a small hole in the anode.<br> 
Those electrons were previously called cathode rays.<br>
 The beam of electrons emerging from the anode passes through a vertical electric field between two horizontal Y-plates<br>
This enables the electron beam to be deflected vertically.<br> 
 When the top plate is positive and the bottom plate is negative, the negative electron beam will be deflected upwards.<br> 
 The beam also passes through a horizontal electric field between two vertical X-plates.<br> 
 Controls connected to these plates cause the electron beam to be deflected horizontally.<br> 
 The beam then strikes a screen coated with a fluorescent material that gives out light when struck by electrons.<br> 
Experiments<br>
 1. Plug in the cathode ray tube.<br> 
 Deflect the beam of the CRT by holding a permanent magnet near the edge of the tube.<br> 
 If the beam disappears, you are holding the magnet too close, OR,<br>
 deflect the beam by attaching a battery to the binding posts and adjusting the variable control knob, OR<br>
 connect the battery directly to the deflection plate terminals.<br> 
2. To make a CRO, seal platinum wire into wide bore glass tubing.<br>
 The main tube is now strongly heated and the heated fused glass pushed into the hole so that the end is completely sealed.<br> 
 The closed end is now alternately heated and blown until it is neatly rounded.<br> 
 3. Bar magnet near a black and white television screen<br>
 The field of the bar magnet interacts with the magnetic field due to the stream of cathode rays so that the picture moves.<br> 
<b>BE CAREFUL! DO NOT MOVE A BAR MAGNET NEAR A COLOUR TELEVISION SCREEN!</b>.<br> 

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="38.2.2H">38.2.2</a> Fluorescent lamp<br>
 <a href="../images/28.199.gif">See diagram 28.199</a>: Low voltage light source.<br>
 Materials may emit light and other radiation when illuminated by higher frequency radiation or by streams of electrons.<br> 
 Electron tubes contain gas under reduced pressure that allow movement of electrons between electrodes, e.g. the now obsolete thermionic valve.<br> 
 A fluorescent lamp is a gas discharge tube containing mercury vapour at low pressure.<br> 
 It emits light, because the inside of the tube is coated with a fluorescent substance, phosphor.<br> 
 Electric current passes through the mercury vapour and produces ultraviolet radiation that hits the phosphor and is converted to light.<br> 
 In a tube, the gas discharge tube contains gas at low pressure that glows red.<br> 
 In a cathode ray tube, or in an X-ray tube, electrons from a heated cathode hit a fluorescent screen to produce light.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="38.2.3H">38.2.3</a> Gas discharge tubes<br>
Gas discharge tubes, discharge tubes (Cathode ray tubes)<br>
 The gas discharge tube contains gas at low pressure.<br> 
 The electric field from the potential difference between the cathode and anode causes ions and free electrons to accelerate towards the electrodes and collide
 with particles to excite them and create more ions.<br> 
 The decay of the excited particles releases characteristic light.<br> 
 In an evacuated discharge tube, electrons from the cathode can be deflected by the application of electric or magnetic fields so electrons must be charged particles.<br> 
 The light from discharge tubes containing pure elements can be analysed using a spectrophotometer into the lines of different colours emitted.<br> 
 This information can lead to identification of elements in a sample.<br> 
 By using a hydrogen discharge tube, the frequencies of visible light, UV radiation and infra-red radiation can be measured to explain the energy transition level
 for the electron in the hydrogen atom in kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>.<br> 
 The flow of electric charge through gas occurs in fluorescent light bulbs and lightning.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="38.2.4H">38.2.4</a> Incandescent lamp<br>
 Hot solids or liquids emit wavelengths of radiation depending on the temperature as a continuous spectrum.<br> 
 At lower temperatures they emit red wavelengths, so the metal appears to be "red hot".<br> 
 At higher temperatures, they emit the full visible spectrum as white light, so the metal appears to be "white hot" or "incandescent".<br> 
 The incandescent filament in an electric light globe, a filament lamp, is "white hot".<br> 

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="38.3.1H">38.3.1</a> Radio waves<br>
 Radio waves, radio station<br>
 Light Modulation, Photo Phone Kit, amplitude modulation<br>
 1. Radio frequency, AC, signal pulse, Frequency bands VHF, Telecommunications, radio receivers, wireless, waveband carriers, wave tuners, transmitters, 
receivers, modulator, UHF radio wave generator<br>
 2. Frequency modulated, FM, amplitude modulated, AM, signal<br>
 Aerial or antenna is a length of wire in the air for the purpose of receiving radio waves.<br> 
 AM Amplitude Modulation is a type of radio communication where audio frequency signals vary the strength of a radio frequency carrier wave,
 called modulation.<br> 
 Amplify means to enlarge a small current, but keep the original signal information.<br> 
 The broadcast band is the part of the radio frequency spectrum for local radio stations, e.g. 530 to 1600 kHz.<br> 
 The carrier Wave in AM radio wave is the part that does not have any signal information itself, but carries the signal with it.<br> 
 Feedback occurs when some or all of the output of a device (an amplifier, for example) can be fed back into the input.<br> 
 Accidental feedback is unwanted, e.g. acoustic feedback from a speaker to a microphone with a resultant squeal).<br> 
 Deliberate feedback includes the many types of circuits where feedback is used to correct operation.<br> 
 Radio frequency is the part of the spectrum with frequencies from around 20 kHz and above.<br> 
 3. Radio transmission and reception<br>
 <a href="../images/38.1.07d.gif">See diagram 38.1.07e</a>: Radio transmission and reception.<br>
 <a href="../images/38.1.08d.gif">See diagram 38.1.08</a>: Radio transmission and reception.<br>
 Heinrich Hertz is credited with being the first person to send and receive radio signals between 1885 and 1889.<br> 
 However, some people say it had been done twice before, in 1866 by Mahlon Loomis and in 1879 by David E Hughes.<br> 
 4. Experiment<br>
 Closely wind one hundred turns of 28 S.W.G. enamelled wire on a cardboard tube of approximate diameter 5 cm.<br> 
 This coil, called an inductor, is tuned with a variable condenser of maximum capacity 0.0005 microfarads.<br> 
 Detect radio signals from the local transmitter by means of either the diode valve used previously or a Germanium diode.<br> 
 5. An oscillator circuit produces alternating current at any frequency, but usually audio or radio frequencies.<br> 
 The function of the diode is to rectify the current oscillations, and to permit detection of the audio frequencies by the earpiece.<br> 
 By varying the inductance or capacity of such a circuit, it is possible to receive broadcasts of different radio frequencies from radio stations.<br>
This is because the tuning circuit can resonate electrically with the Light Dependent Diode frequency being received.<br> 
 6. Comment: The function of the diode in radio reception:<br> 
 A diode is a non-linear device that has the property of being able to "mix" several frequencies.<br> 
 In mathematical terms this is "multiplying".<br> 
 The side band frequencies are being mixed with the carrier produced by the resonance of the LC circuit.)<br>
 7. Experiment<br>
 * Use a DC moving coil voltmeter with a full-scale deflection of 10 volts.<br> 
 On connecting it to a suitable source of AC there should be no deflection of the pointer.<br> 
 On connection to either a Germanium or a Silicon diode, a deflection should be observed.<br>
 This is because the diode, which is a semi-conductor, allows electrons to flow in one direction only.<br> 
 This is an example of half wave rectification as in 38.41.5.<br> 
 * Replace the voltmeter in the circuit with a Cathode Ray Oscillograph.<br> 
 Connect the leads to the vertical deflection plates to obtain patterns as in diagram 38.41.4.<br> 
 Suitable diodes include OA 2 10.<br> 
 Use a diode valve instead of a semi-conductor or use a triode or multigrid valve by joining the grid of the valve to the anode.<br> 
 The joined elements then act as the anode.<br> 
 * Use a 12 AD 6 valve, because it may be operated from a 12 volt supply.<br> 
 Connect the anode to one end of the secondary coil as in diagram 41.4 and the cathode to the voltmeter.<br> 
 Heat the cathode with car battery current and observe the voltmeter.<br> 

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="38.3.2H">38.3.2</a> Choke coils<br>
 Choke coils affects both AC and DC<br>
 <a href="../images/38.1.01d.gif">See diagram 38.1.03</a>: Passage of current through a choke coil.<br>
 A choke is a high-inductance coil used to smooth variations or change the phase of the alternating current fed into it.<br> 
 A choke is an inductor that slows changes of electric current and opposes the flow of this changing current.<br> 
 An inductor has the same effect on an alternating current as a resistor has on a direct current.<br> 
 In a radio circuit, use an inductor to oppose the flow of high or low frequency current and permit the passage of direct current only.<br> 
 Use the primary coil of a soldering iron transformer.<br> 
 The lamp glows brightly with DC, but not with AC.<br> 

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="38.3.3H">38.3.3</a> Diode valve<br>
<a href="../images/38.1.04d.gif">See diagram 38.1.04</a>: Diode valve.<br>
A radio valve has two electrodes, so it is called a diode.<br> 
A heated filament loses electrons by thermionic emission.<br> 
The filament electrode is connected to the negative terminal of a variable voltage power pack to deliver both AC and DC.<br> 
Connect the other electrode, the anode, to the positive terminal, so that an electric current flows between the electrodes.<br> 
Connect the type AV 33 diode valve in the circuit.<br> 
The filament heated by a 4 volt battery supplies the electrons, so it is called the cathode, being negative with respect to the other, the anode.<br> 
If the cathode circuit is "broken" so that no electrons are emitted, there is an open circuit in the valve, so current does not flow from the anode battery.<br> 
If the anode circuit is "broken ", the heated cathode still emits electrons, so the filament battery would be useless, although no current would flow from the anode.<br> 

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="38.3.4H">38.3.4</a> Diodes<br>
Diodes, laser diodes<br>
 <a href="../images/38.2.2.gif">See diagram 38.2.2</a>: P-N junction.<br>
 <a href="../images/38.2.2a.png">See diagram 38.2.2a</a>: P-N junction graphs.<br>
 1. Wafers of P-type and N-type semiconductors can be combined in direct physical content to form a P-N junction diode or PN diode that lets current flow
 through it in one direction as electrons move from N-type to P-type semiconductors.<br> 
 A device with a single P-N junction has two electrodes forming a semiconductor diode.<br> 
 It is represented in the diagram as 1. the cathode, the electrode connected to the N-type wafer as a straight line and 2. the anode, the electrode connected to
 the P-type wafer, as an arrow.<br> 
 Electrons flow easily from N to P in the opposite direction to the arrow.<br> 
 Hardly any electrons can flow from P to N in the direction of the arrow.<br> 
 2. When a PN diode is placed in a circuit, in series with a battery and resistor, conventional current flows from the positive terminal of the battery, throug
 P to N, to the negative terminal of the battery, called forward bias.<br> 
 Connect the negative terminal of the battery to the cathode and the positive terminal to the anode.<br> 
 3. With reverse bias, no conventional current flows across the junction, through N to P.<br> 
 Connect the positive terminal of the battery to the cathode and the negative terminal to the anode.<br> 
 The P-N junction acts like a thin dielectric layer, like an electrical insulator so no current can flow through the diode.<br> 
 However, if the voltage is increased without limit, a threshold voltage is reached where the diode suddenly starts to conduct, called the avalanche effect.<br> 
 A P-N junction under reverse bias can act as a capacitor and this property is used in varactor diodes made from silicon or gallium arsenide, GaAs.<br> 
 4. A minimum voltage is needed to cause movement of electrons through the P-N junction, called the forward breakover voltage, and usually between 0.3 V
 and 1V, e.g. 0.6 V in a common silicon diode.<br> 
 5. The resistors in the diagram are called "current-limiting resistors" to control the current so the diode cannot be damaged by battery voltage exceeding the
 forward breakover value or avalanche value.<br> 
 6. As diodes let current flow only in one direction, they must be place correctly in a circuit.<br> 
 It is difficult to understand diodes in terms of conventional current flow, so refer to electron flow and ignore any arrows on device symbols.<br> 
 7. Power diodes or protection diodes protect the circuit against reversal of current flow.<br> 
 8. Signal diodes, made of Germanium, detect radio frequency currents.<br> 
 Signal diodes in radio receivers have very low voltage drop.<br> 
 9. Diodes are frequently used as rectifiers to change alternating current to pulsating direct current or, with smoothing, to direct current, e.g. IN4001.<br> 
 They may be used simply as a reversed polarity protection device.<br> 
 10. Laser diodes are of two types: 1. injection laser diodes (ILD) and 2. optically pumped laser diodes.<br> 
 Laser diodes are used in telecommunications with fibre optics, bar code readers, red or green laser pointers for lecturers, CR-ROM technology, image
 scanners, welding, pumping other lasers, surgery.<br> 

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="38.6.8H">38.6.8</a> Semiconductor insteadof diode valve<br>
 Use a semi-conductor as a detector instead of the diode valve.<br>
 Use an aerial coil from a discarded radio receiver in place of the one described.<br> 
 If the leads from the diode and the junction of the coil and condenser are connected to the amplifier of a projector with a jack plug,
 the class can listen to local radio transmission.<br> 

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="38.4.1H">38.41</a> Semiconductors<br>
 Semiconductors have a resistivity between conductors and insulators.<br> 
 Their conductivity increases with temperature and is affected by impurities in their crystals.<br> 
 They are used in solid state devices, e.g. diodes and transistors.<br> 
 Silicon and Germanium, in group 4 of the periodic table, are commonly used.<br> 

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="38.4.2H">38.4.2</a> Earphones<br>
Earphones, crystal microphones<br>
 Crystal earphones and crystal microphones use piezoelectric crystals to convert electrical voltage into sound waves.<br> 
 Crystal earphones have high impedance and are not polarized.<br> 
 The two way behaviour of piezoelectric crystals allow the crystal earphones to be used as a crystal microphone.<br> 
 Magnetic earphones and microphones use a coil, permanent magnet and diaphragm to convert electrical voltage into sound waves.<br> 
 Magnetic earphones have low impedance and are not polarized.<br> 
 Speak into a magnetic earphones to use it as a microphone.<br> 
 Similarly the loudspeaker and horn type loudspeaker have a coil for a driver.<br> 
 Volume control is usually by a potentiometer situated at the input to the main amplifying section of the circuit.<br>

<a href="../images/38.2.00.gif">See diagram 38.2.00</a>: Electronics symbols.<br>
 Hardwiring means connecting the component leads with wire if there are only few components in the circuit.<br> 
 A bread board is a plastic sheet with holes for the component leads to be pushed in.<br> 
 Strip board has holes in parallel copper tracks.<br> 
 The components are soldered to the tracks to make circuits.<br> 
 Printed circuit boards (PCBs) are made from sheets of copper attached to flat material with the copper are etched
 away to make tracks for the conductors between components instead of using wires.<br> 
 Components are soldered to the tracks to make complicated circuits in a small space.<br> 
 Earth or ground means direct connection to the earth or to a chassis or place of zero voltage.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="38.4.4H">38.4.4</a> Soldering for electronic circuits</a><br>
<b>Be careful!<br>
 The soldering bit becomes very hot!<br>
 Do not breath in the poisonous fumes from the solder!<br>
 After handling solder, wash the hands!</span></b><br>
 Use side cutters with blades placed at one side to crop the ends off component leads after components have been soldered
 to a printed circuit board (PCB), now called printed wiring boards, because "PCB" also refers to carcinogenic chemicals.<br> 
 Use wire strippers on single core or stranded thin equipment wire when connecting off board components to the strip board
 or PCB, or when constructing a prototype circuit on breadboard.<br> 
 Use soldering irons with low wattage, preferable with silicone insulated cable fitted to prevent accidentally melting of the
 mains cable, and with a 4 mm bit.<br> 
 Use a soldering iron stand, because the temperature of a soldering iron bit can reach 400C.<br> 
 Use a desoldering pump as a solder sucker to remove excess solder from a joint.<br> 
 Solder for electronics should be 22 swg 60% tin, 40% lead alloy, including a flux core.<br> 
 The melted flux cleans the component leads and strip board or PCB tracks.<br> 
 When first using a new soldering iron bit, "tin the bit" with solder by
holding the solder against the bit as the iron heats up.<br> 
 Let the solder melt onto the bit and wipe off excess solder with a wet sponge.<br> 
 To solder a wire or component lead to strip board or a PCB, push the lead through the hole in the board with 5 mm of the lead
 protruding.<br> 
 Place the tip of the soldering iron at an angle against both the track and the lead and allow both to heat up.<br> 
 Feed the solder in around the track and it will run around the track and the lead if the track and the lead are hot enough.<br> 
 Remove the soldering iron.<br> 
 The solder joint should look shiny and have a pyramid shape.<br> 
 A dull looking joint, "dry joint", may be a weak joint due to using too much solder.<br> 
 If so remove the solder with the desoldering pump and try again.<br> 
 Remove excess wire or lead with the side cutters.<br> 
 To join two wires together, first "tin" to let solder melt onto each one wire, bring the tinned ends together, then heat again briefly.<br> 
 Integrated circuits (ICs, or microchips) and transistors may be damaged by the heat from during soldering.<br> 
 Integrated circuits should be inserted into an IC holder and inserted on the board when soldering is completed.<br> 
 As transistors must be soldered directly to the board attach a crocodile clip to each lead before it is soldered to act as a "heat shunt" to
 absorb the heat during soldering.<br> 
 Heat-shrinkable sleeving is used around wires joined to off board components to give the joint extra mechanical strength.<br> 
 (Comment: The by-products of soldering are lead and lead oxide particles.<br> 
 Flux fumes used to be corrosive and could damage the nasal passages and eyes.<br> 
 However, nowadays most fluxes are water based and relatively harmless but hey do not clean the surfaces so effectively so more lead-tin
 is consumed in hand soldering.<br> 
 Machine soldering is another matter.<br> 
 Some solders are non-lead solders.<br> 
 Other methods of connection include crimping, bolt and nut, and star washer, e.g. brass clamps of car battery terminals.)<br>

 <a href="../images/38.2.01.gif">See diagram 38.2.01</a>: Resistors colour code.<br>
 <a href="../images/Resistorcolorcode.jpg">Resistor colour code</a><br>
 A resistor in a circuit opposes the flow of electric current through it, allowing some current to flow, and changes the voltage drop following Ohm's Law.<br> 
 Resistor values include 1 k = 1 000 ohms and 1 M = 1 000 000 ohms.<br> 
 Usually, combinations of 1 k and 10 k are used in series and parallel for school experiments.<br> 
 The maximum error is called the tolerance value, usually 10% tolerance.<br> 
 If the power rating in Watts (W) is exceeded, the resistor may be damaged.<br> 
 For school experiments usually 0.6 W resistors are suitable.<br> 
 A resistor colour code is used for fixed value they are so small.<br> 
 The four band colour code uses three coloured bands for the resistor's value, and another coloured band for the resistor's tolerance.<br> 
 The first two bands indicate the first two digits of the resistor's value.<br> 
 The third band indicate the number of zeros to be placed after the first two digits.<br> 
 The forth band indicates the resistor's tolerance as a percentage.<br> 
 The five band colour code uses the same colours as the four band system, but an extra band indicates another digit, and gold and silver
 bands indicate multipliers of 0.1 and 0.01.<br> 
 The five band system can indicate values lower than 1.<br> 
 The first three bands give the first three digits of the resistor's value.<br> 
 The fourth band indicates the number of zeroes to be places after the first three digits.<br> 
 The fifth band gives the resistor's tolerance as a percentage.<br> 
 A polarized component must be connected in a certain way for the circuit to operate.<br> 
 If reverse connected, damage may occur.<br> 
 Resistors are not polarized so they can be placed either way in the circuit.<br> 
 <hr width="100%" size="2">Potentiometer<br>
 A potentiometer, variable resistor, is a fixed resistor with a slide arm to select different resistances.<br> 
 It has three terminals, one terminal to each end of the resistance and one to the slide arm.<br> 
 Potentiometers may be polarized.<br> 
 (Comment: It is almost impossible to get 10% tolerance resisters nowadays - most are 5% or better.<br> 
 Other problems with resistors are the temperature effects and power dissipation.)<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="38.4.6H">38.4.6</a> P-type and N-type semiconductors<br>
 All semiconductors, e.g. silicon, are insulators.<br> 
 However, the silicon atom has four outer electrons so it can form bonds with electrons from four atoms around it to form silicon crystals.<br> 
 Phosphorus has five outer electrons.<br> 
 If phosphorus is added to silicon crystals, called chip doping or metallizing doping, the phosphorus atoms each provide an extra electron to
 make an N-type semiconductor with free electrons to conduct electricity.<br> 
 Aluminium has three outer electrons.<br> 
 If silicon crystals are doped with aluminium, each aluminium atom lacks one electron for bonding.<br> 
 So it has a "positive hole" to make a P-type semiconductor that can accept electrons.<br> 

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="38.4.7H">38.4.7</a> Diode as a half-wave rectifier<br>
 Construction and testing of a diode rectifier and smoothing capacitor circuit to convert AC to DC voltage<br>
 A semiconductor diode, like a thermionic diode, rectifies, i.e. converts alternating current, AC to pulses of direct current, DC,
 called half-wave rectification.<br>
 The diode removes the negative cycles of AC to give a varying one way direct voltage across the load requiring DC supply.<br> 
 The humps are smoothed by connecting an electrolytic capacitor across the load.<br> 
 During the positive half cycles of the AC current, flow occurs through the load and also into the electrolytic capacitor.<br> 
 During the negative half cycles of the AC current, flow occurs when the diode is reversed biased and not conducting current.<br>
The electrolytic capacitor partly discharges through the load, maintaining the current through the load and a steadier voltage.<br> 

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="38.4.8H">38.4.8</a> Zener diode<br>
 The Zener diode lets current flow only in one direction, but only up to a certain voltage.<br> 
 Then the reverse resistance drops and the diode conducts reverse current maintaining a constant voltage drop.<br> 
 It can control the maximum voltage in the circuit.<br> 
 So a 12 V Zener diode is similar to a junction diode in forward bias, but shows a sharp increase in reverse current at 12 volts.<br> 
 A Zener diode can be used for voltage reference or as a voltage regulator.<br>
 The end closer to the cathode is marked with a band.<br> 
 (Comment: Zener diodes are a bit more complex than outlined here.<br> 
 For example, there are different thermal effects between Zener diodes and Avalanche diodes, although marketers bunch them together.<br> 
 Semiconductors do come between conductors and insulators, but the thermal effect on resistance is quite different between conductors
 and semi-conductors.)<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="38.4.9H">38.4.9</a> Light-emitting diode<br>
 The LED is a P-N junction diode that emits light when the forward bias voltage across it exceeds a certain value and current flows.<br> 
 The positive lead, anode, through which conventional current enters, may be longer and the cathode side might be cut flat or have a coloured dot.<br> 
 LEDs are damaged by reverse polarity or excessive forward voltage, so they must be protected by a resistance in series to allow a forward bias
 of about 2 volts.<br> 
 LEDs are used for low voltage alpha-numeric displays in calculators, warning lamps, and as indicator lights.<br> 
 They consume much less electricity than an incandescent lamp and they rarely fail.<br> 
 The usual LED has a red or orange 5 mm diameter dome shaped container.<br> 
 Some LEDs are bicolour and tricolour.<br> 
 A LED is a diode, so current flows in one direction only through it.<br> 
 A forward biased LED lights with a voltage drop across it of 0.7 V.<br> 
 Reversed bias current does not flow through the LED so it does not light, but reverse bias will not harm it.<br> 
 If a LED needs a forward bias voltage of 2 V and current 20 mA, place a resistor in series with resistance, R = voltage of power supply - 2 volts / 0.02 amps.<br> 
 A domed LED has the longest lead as the positive lead, or anode, and the shortest lead as the negative lead, or cathode.<br> 
 Also the plastic container nearest the cathode will be flattened slightly and if hold up to a light, the largest part inside will be nearest the cathode.<br> 
 LED lamps are much cheaper, but some people find difficulty in seeing small things under it, e.g. threading a needle.<br>

 The LED can be used in a circuit to give 2 kinds of information as follows:<br>
 1. Whether current is passing though the circuit, i.e. all components have current passing through them,<br>
 2. Whether more or less current is passing, because the LED can glow brighter or less bright.<br> 
 Experiment<br>
 In the circuit include a resistor of about 400 ohms and a protection diode, e.g. IN4002:<br>
 1. Test an incandescent lamp.<br> 
 If the LED glows then there is no break in the lamp filament.<br> 
 2. Test a resistor, e.g. about 1000 ohms and note the brightness of the LED.<br> 
 Add a second resistor in series and note the brightness of the LED.<br> 
 Add a third resistor in series and note the brightness of the LED.<br> 
 The light from the LED gets dimmer, because the resistance gets greater, R = r1 + r2 + r3.<br> 
 3. Test a resistor, e.g. about 1000 ohms.<br> 
 Note the brightness of the LED and add a second resistor in parallel.<br> 
 Note the brightness of the LED and ad a third resistor in parallel.<br> 
 Note the brightness of the LED.<br> 
 The light from the LED gets brighter, because the resistance becomes less, 1 / R = 1 / r1 + 1 / r2 + 1 / r3.<br> 
 4. Test a diode by inserting in the circuit not in the direction indicated.<br> 
 The LED does not give out light.<br> 
 Test a diode by inserting in the circuit in the direction indicated.<br> 
 The LED does give out light.<br> 
 5. Test an electrolytic capacitor, e.g. 100 muF.<br> 
 As the capacitor charges the LED glows, but as the capacitor achieves full charge the LED brightness decreases
 until when fully charged, then the LED stops glowing.<br> 
 The LED "glow" might be a brief flash, depending on the value in farads of the capacitor.<br>

 The humps in the DC are smoothed by connecting a large electrolytic capacitor across a resistance.<br> 
 During the positive half cycles of the AC supply, the diode conducts current that flows through the resistor and also into the electrolytic capacitor.<br> 
 During the negative half cycles of the AC supply, when the diode is reverse biased and non-conducting, the electrolytic capacitor partly discharges
 through the resistance.<br> 
 The charge storing action of the electrolytic capacitor thus maintains current through the resistor and a steadier voltage across it.<br>

 A thin layer of P-type semiconductor between two layers of N-type semiconductor is used for an N-P-N, transistor.<br> 
 A bipolar transistor ("transfer resistor") is a semiconductor sandwich with a very thin filling of either p-type or n-type material called the base.<br> 
 The outside layers, called the collector and emitter, are the same, but of a different material to the base.<br> 
 The two kinds of transistor are N-P-N (or NPN) and P-N-P (or PNP).<br> 
 The arrow on the emitter in the symbol indicates the direction of conventional current in the transistor and shows its type.<br> 
 Whichever way the transistor is drawn the arrow points out for an NPN transistor and in for a PNP transistor.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="38.5.2H">38.5.2</a> NPN transistors<br>
 Silicon NPN types are most common.<br> 
 The transistor has 3 leads:<br>
 1. the base lead or B to the middle P-type semiconductor,<br>
 2. the collector lead or C to the first N-type semiconductor,<br>
 3. the emitter lead or E from the second N-type semiconductor.<br> 
 An NPN transistor has a positive voltage on its collector and a negative voltage on its emitter.<br> 
 When a positive voltage to the emitter is applied to the base the transistor lets current to flow through the collector / emitter circuit.<br> 
 Small current through the base circuit causes much greater current through the emitter / collector circuit.<br> 
 This current gain measures how much the transistor can amplify.<br> 
 The arrow in the circuit diagram for the emitter points outwards.<br> 
 Transistors are fast switches.<br> 
 They can be damaged if too hot and must have the correct direction of connection.<br> 
 The emitter can be identified by a tag or by the shape of the case or by a dot.<br> 
 The NPN transistor is connected to the positive lead from the battery and the emitter is connected to the negative lead from the battery.<br>

 If the E and C are connected in a circuit, electrons from the N-type E fill the positive holes in the P-type B so no current can flow.<br>

The ratio of collector current to base current, called current amplification factor, may be a "gain" of 100.<br> 
A certain current to B produces a larger replica current flowing into C from the circuit and out through E to the circuit.<br> 
A field-effect transistor is the most effective device in weak-signal amplifiers, used mostly in wireless receivers.<br> 
They are used in acoustic pickups, audio tape players, compact disc players, because they react to very small input signals and generate minimal internal noise while increasing the signal voltage.<br> 
The sensitivity of a weak-signal amplifier is the ratio: microvolts (10<sup>-6</sup> volts), of signal input /  signal output, (usually 10: 1).<br>

The resistance changes gradually as the amount of light changes so it can be used to monitor light levels.<br> 
The LDR is not polarized.<br> 
A photoelectric sensor can be adjusted respond only to the pulse of a particular LED or a certain threshold of light and not background light.<br> 
A photoelectric proximity switch has the light source and light sensor in the same unit.<br> 
The sensor picks up the pulse of the LED as it reflects off of the object being sensed.<br>

 With 8 bits, 256 different values (the numbers from 0 to 255) can be represented because 2<sup>8</sup> = 256.<br> 
 A groups of 8 bits is called a byte or octet.<br> 
 A bit (Binary digit) is a digit in the binary number system, shown as 0 or 1.<br> 
 A binary number is represented by one or more bits.<br> 
 The binary number system uses successive powers of 2.<br>
 In binary notation the decimal number 11 is represented as the binary number 1011 (decimal numbers 8 + 0 + 2 +1).<br> 
 An analogue signal continuously changing with time, e.g. voltage, pressure, velocity, temperature.<br> 
 A digital signal takes a reading of a signal at regular time intervals so it is a sample of an analogue signal or a value of original data.<br> 
 Digital electronic circuits operate on the presence or absence of highs and lows, a pulse =1 and no pulse = 0.<br> 
 A binary signal is a digital signal that has only two finite number of values.<br>
 Normally, two different voltage values represented by High / Low, ON / OFF, True and False, High and Low, Logic HIGH (or logic 1) Logic LOW (or logic 0).<br>

 Decimal to binary, e.g. decimal number 99<br>
 Highest power of 2 in 99 = 2<sup>6</sup> = 64, 99 - 64 = 35<br>
 Highest power of 2 in 35 = 2<sup>5</sup>= 32, 35 - 32 = 3<br>
 Highest power of 2 in 3 = 2<sup>1</sup> = 2, 3 - 2 = 1<br>
 Highest power of 2 in 1 = 2<sup>0</sup><br>
 So binary number = 1100011<br>
 (64 + 32 + 2 + 1 = 99)<br>
