<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.226H"></a>4.226 Air has mass, break ruler under newspaper<br>
 1. Inflate a balloon and put it on a sensitive balance.<br> 
 Record the weight.<br> 
 Deflate the balloon and weigh again.<br> 
 The weight is less than before, because air exerts the weight force.<br> 
 The first weight is less than the true weight, because a balloon has a large volume relative to its mass, so there has been a significant upward force caused by buoyancy.<br> 
 You live in a "sea of air", but you can usually disregard the effect of buoyancy when you weigh things, because the volume of what you are weighing is small in comparison to its mass.<br> 
 2. Place a flat stick about a metre long so that nearly half of it hangs over the edge of a table or desk.<br> 
 Lay a full sheet of newspaper over the end of the stick on the table and smooth it down carefully.<br> 
 Give the other end of the stick a sharp blow with your hand or a wooden mallet.<br> 
 The stick will break over the edge of the table.<br> 
 The stick breaks, because the inner end has been held down by air pressure on the large sheet of paper.<br> 
 Stand to one side when hitting the stick.<br> 
 3. Place a thin flat stick on a table so nearly half the length hangs over the edge of a table.<br> 
 Lay a sheet of A4 printer paper over the ruler.<br> 
 Hit the end of the flat stick, like a karate chop.<br> 
 The paper and stick rise up and fall down.<br> 
 Place a thin flat stick on a table so nearly half the length hangs over the edge of a table.<br> 
 Lay a sheet of newspaper over the end of the flat stick on the table, fold facing down, and smooth it down.<br> 
 Hit the end of the flat stick, like a karate chop.<br> 
 The flat stick breaks over the edge of the table.<br> 
 The stick breaks, because the air pressure on the large sheet of paper exerts a force down on the paper.<br> 
 The force on the ruler = atmospheric pressure X area of the newspaper.<br> 
 4. Place a full double page sheet from a broadsheet newspaper over a ruler protruding out over the edge of the desk.<br> 
 Hit the end of the ruler sharply.<br> 
 The ruler breaks and page stays in place.<br> 
 The air pressure pressing down on the newspaper holds the newspaper down despite the force of the ruler pushing it up.<br> 
 5. To remove atmospheric pressure from the experiment, 
 use two more rulers at each side of the protruding ruler.<br> 
 Now the air pressure is the same above and below the newspaper.<br> 
 Hit the end of the central ruler sharply.<br> 
 The ruler breaks and page stays in place.<br> 
 The weight of the newspaper broke the ruler.<br> 
 Place a small weight with the same weight as the newspaper on the edge 
 of the ruler over the table.<br> 
 Hit the end of the ruler sharply.<br> 
 The ruler breaks again.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.227H"></a>4.227 Air pressure in all directions<br>
 <a href="./images/37.117.gif">See diagram 37.117</a>: Sucking water up.<br> 
 <a href="./images/4.227.1.gif">See diagram 4.227.1</a>: Finger on drinking straw.<br> 
 <a href="./images/4.227.2.gif">See diagram 4.227.2</a>: Inverted glass: A Glass jar, B Water, C Paper, D Air pressure.<br>

 <a href="./images/4.227.4.gif">See diagram 4.227.4</a>: Plumber's force cups: A Two plumber's force cups, B Wooden handle, C Rubber.<br> 
 1. Finger on drinking straw<br>
 Hold a finger over the end of a piece of straight glass tube or drinking straw and lower the tube into a container of coloured water.<br> 
 Water does not replace the air in the tube.<br> 
 Remove the finger and water enters the tube.<br> 
 Replace the finger on the top of the tube and then lift the tube from the container.<br> 
 The water remains in the tube, because the effect of the air pressure up the tube is greater than the weight of the water.<br> 
 Remove your finger and the water falls out of the tube.<br> 
 2. Inverted glass<br>
 Fill a drinking glass with water.<br> 
 Cover the glass with a flat piece of glass or cardboard so that no air exists between the cover and the water.<br> 
 Turn the glass and cover upside down.<br> 
 The cover remains in place, because the pressure of the air pushing up is greater than the pressure of the water pushing down.<br> 
 3. Holes in a beverage can<br>
 Make a small hole in the top of a beverage can.<br> 
 It is very difficult to suck the drink through the hole or to pour the drink into a glass.<br> 
 Make a second hole in the beverage can.<br> 
 Now it is easy to suck the drink through the hole or to pour the drink into a glass.<br> 
 Sucking reduces pressure at one hole in the can so the air pressure acting through the second hole forces drink into your mouth or lets you pour the drink into a glass.<br> 
 4. Push a drinking straw through a hole in a beverage can<br>
 Make a hole with a nail near the bottom of an open metal can.<br> 
 Fill the can with water.<br> 
 Hold the palm of the hand tightly over the top and water stops running from the hole.<br> 
 Remove the hand and water runs from the hole.<br> 
 5. Sucking water up<br>
 Fit a flask with a two-holes stopper.<br> 
 Fit the stopper with a straight glass tube and a bent glass tube through the holes.<br> 
 Pour water into the flask and fix the stopper in the flask tightly.<br> 
 You can suck water up the straight tube.<br> 
 However, if you close the end of the bent tube with your finger, you cannot suck up water through the straight tube.<br> 
 Remove the finger and sucking is easy again.<br> 
 Instead of sucking, blow through the straight glass tube.<br> 
 Increased atmospheric pressure on the surface of the water causes water to rise up the bent glass tube.<br> 
 6. Suction disc<br>
 A rubber suction disc stays on a smooth window, because no air exists between the disc and the window.<br> 
 The pressure of the atmosphere on the rubber disc keeps it pressed to the window.<br> 
 7. Plumber's force cups<br>
 7.1 Press a plumber's force cup against a flat surface, e.g. the top of a stool, and lift the stool.<br> 
 The force cup works better if the rubber is wet.<br> 
 The force cup works, because almost no air remains between the object and the force cup.<br> 
 However, the air in the atmosphere is pressing down on the rubber with atmospheric pressure.<br> 
 7.2 Wet the rims of two plumber's force cups.<br> 
 Press the rubber cups tightly together.<br> 
 Try to pull them apart.<br> 
 This experiment is similar to the historical demonstration of air pressure called the Magdeburg hemispheres.<br> 
 8. Vacuum cleaner<br>
 See: <a href="./commercial/Commercial3.html#Vacuum">Vacuum</a> (Commercial).<br> 
 A vacuum cleaner pumps some air away from over the dirty carpet creating a "partial vacuum".<br> 
 Air rushes in to replace the air pumped out and when it is pumped away it takes with it the dirt from the carpet.<br> 
 The more air that you remove the greater the force from the atmospheric pressure to replace it.<br> 
 In a laboratory, it is impossible to pump all the air out of an enclosed space to create a perfect vacuum.<br> 
 "Nature abhors a vacuum" (Spinosa, 1677, in <i>Ethics</i>).<br> 
 Players of golf and baseball may complain about "heavy air" during damp weather, but the weight of a volume of air is actually less during bad weather caused by low pressure.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.229H"></a>4.229 Mercury barometer, barometric pressure, atmospheric pressure<br>
See: <a href="./commercial/Commercial.html#Barometers">Barometers</a>, (Commercial).<br> 
<a href="./physics/UNPh12.html#12.1.01">See 12.1.01</a>: Pressure definitions.<br> 
<a href="./images/12.307.gif">See diagram 12.307</a>: Mercury barometer.<br> 
 The "space" is the Torricelli "vacuum" that contains mercury vapour.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">In SI units, standard value for atmospheric pressure at sea level is 101 325 pascals, 101.325 kPa.<br> 
 Correction of barometer readings to 0<sup>o</sup>C temperature for a mercury barometer with a brass scale.<br>
 The value of dh should be subtracted from the observed height of the mercury column to give the true pressure in mm Hg (1 mm Hg = 133.322 Pa).<br> 
 dh = -0.0001634 ht / (1+0.0001818 t), where h = observed column height in mm and t = the temperature in degrees Celsius.<br>
 Thermal expansion coefficient for mercury (volume) = 181 × 10<sup>-8</sup>K<sup>-1</sup>.<br> 
 Thermal expansion coefficient for brass (linear) = 20.3 × 10<sup>-8</sup>K<sup>-1</sup>.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">1. Do NOT construct a mercury barometer in a school science lessons<br>
 However, if you have access to a mercury barometer you can note how it works.<br> 
 The barometer is manufactured by filling a strong glass tube sealed at one end with mercury, then inverting the open end of the tube in a reservoir of mercury.<br> 
 The mercury in the tube drops down to a steady level leaving above it a vacuum with some mercury vapour.<br> 
 The vertical distance between the level of mercury in the tube and the reservoir is the height of mercury with the same pressure as the atmosphere, the atmospheric pressure.<br> 
 The average atmospheric pressure is about 760 mm of mercury, mmHg (29.9 inches, 1013.2 millibars).<br> 
 The height of the mercury drops with increase in altitude, about 4.5 cm for every 270 m.<br> 
 To read the barometer, tap the side of the tube to prevent the mercury sticking to it, adjust the height of mercury with the zero adjustment knob, then read the height of the meniscus with the vernier.<br> 
 You can adjust the reading for temperature and latitude, g is least at the equator.<br> 
 Barometric pressure is the pressure of the atmosphere read from a barometer in millibars, mbar, or hectopascals, hPa.<br> 
 (1 mbar = 1 hPa) (1 pascal, Pa = 1 N / m<sup>2</sup>).<br> 
 One atmosphere = approximately 100 kilopascals (100 kPa).<br> 
 2. You can construct a water barometer, but you will need a tube 10.3 m long.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.230H"></a>4.230 Aneroid barometer, barograph<br>
 See: <a href="./commercial/Commercial.html#Barometers">Barometers</a>, (Commercial).<br> 
<a href="./images/4.230.gif">See diagram 4.230</a>: Aneroid barometer: A Sealed rubber tube.<br> 
A barograph keeps a continuous record of pressure with a pen attached to an aneroid barometer recording on paper on a rotating drum.<br> 
1. Use a corrugated rubber tube from a motor car, or a bicycle handle grip.<br> 
 Compress the rubber tube then insert two corks at the ends so that the tube can function as a vacuum box.<br> 
 Make the tube airtight by sealing the corked closed ends with wax and by tying around the outside with wire.<br> 
 Attach a weight to hang from the lower cork to extend the tube.<br> 
 Attach a pointer to the weight so that it points to a scale.<br> 
 You can read any changes in atmospheric pressure from the scale.<br> 
 The aneroid barometer is not as accurate as the mercury barometer.<br> 
 An altimeter is an aneroid barometer used in aircraft.<br> 
 The pilot can adjust it before takeoff so that the zero on the altimeter scale corresponds to ground level at the aerodrome.<br> 
 2. Cut the neck off a balloon then stretch the rubber over the mouth of a large wide mouth jar to form an air-tight seal.<br> 
 Tie a string tightly around the mouth of the container to keep the rubber in place.<br> 
 Make a pointer by attaching one end of a light stick or straw to the centre of the rubber with adhesive tape.<br> 
 The other end of the stick or straw can point to a scale to show changes in atmospheric pressure.<br> 
 The pointer moves up or down as atmospheric pressure changes.<br> 
 3. Blow and suck on a chamber containing an aneroid barometer.<br> 
 Put an aneroid barometer in a sealable chamber with a tap and evacuate the jar with an electric pump.<br>

<a href="./images/4.232x.gif">See diagram 4.232</a>: Measure atmospheric pressure with a rubber suction cup.<br> 
 1. Measure the area of the suction cup by pressing it down onto a sheet of glass above a sheet of graph paper and drawing its outline.<br> 
 Measure the diameter to calculate the area.<br> 
 Record the area A.<br> 
 Attach the hook of the spring balance to the neck of the sucker.<br> 
 Use a spring balance to find the force required to pull the sucker away from a smooth surface, e.g. a sheet of glass.<br> 
 Record the force, F.<br> 
 Calculate the average atmospheric pressure.<br> 
 When there is no air inside the sucker, by fully pressing the sucker on the smooth surface the force shown on the spring balance equals the force, because of atmospheric pressure acting on the sucker.<br> 
 Pressure = force / area.<br> 
 Repeat the experiment with different size suckers, then calculate the average atmospheric pressure.<br> 
 The average atmospheric pressure at sea level is 1.033 kilogram per square centimetre, 14.7 pounds per square inch.<br>

 Some new types of steel wool, e.g. "Steelo", are manufactured from stainless steel, so do not rust!<br>
 1. Wash a small wad of steel wool in petrol to remove any grease.<br> 
 Squeeze it out and then fluff it.<br> 
 When it is dry, place the steel wool in a flask fitted with a one-hole stopper carrying a 40 cm length of glass tube.<br> 
 Stand the flask and tube in a container of water with the end of the tube under water.<br> 
 After a few hours, note that water is slowly drawn up into the glass tube.<br> 
 As the oxygen in the air reacts with the iron to form rust (iron oxides, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) the air pressure decreases in the flask.<br>

 "Fountain Connection", connects two plastic soft drink bottles, Hero of Alexandria's water fountain (toy product)<br>
<a href="./images/12.2.11.gif">See diagram 12.2.11</a>: Hero's fountain.<br> 
 Use two plastic drink bottles and half a bottle as a reservoir.<br> 
 Half fill the bottles with water, attach the stoppers with the inserted glass tubes then connect the bottles and the reservoir.<br> 
 Pour water into the reservoir until the glass tube from the reservoir to the lower bottle is full of water.<br> 
 As water flows down this tube, because of the weight of water in the reservoir the air pressure in the lower bottle increases and this pressure is transmitted up the glass tube connecting the two bottles 
 to the upper bottle.<br> 
 So the increased air pressure becomes the same in both bottles.<br> 
 The increased air pressure in the upper bottle forces water up and out of the outlet tube as a fountain.<br> 
 Some of the water from the fountain can move down through the system again, but the height of the jet of water is constantly decreasing and the fountain can continue only until all of the water in the reservoir has run down into the bottom bottle.<br> 
 To the end of the outlet tube, attach a plastic tube with, the same internal cross-section area to show that the water rises until its height above the surface of the water in the reservoir is equal to the height between the water levels in the bottles.<br>

See: <a href="./commercial/Commercial.html#Barometers">Barometers</a>, (Commercial).<br> 
 Atmospheric pressure is exerted by the weight of the air above any place of the surface of the earth.<br> 
 At sea level atmospheric pressure will support a column of mercury 760 cm high, in SI units 101.325 kilopascal, called one standard atmosphere, but less with an increase in altitude.<br> 
 The mercury is at temperature 0<sup>o</sup>C and the value of g is that at sea level, latitude 45<sup>o</sup>.<br> 
 Variations in the atmospheric pressure is measure by a barometer.<br> 
 The standard atmosphere is a hypothetical atmosphere having the approximate average state of the real atmosphere in which the pressure and temperature is defined at all heights.<br> 
 This internationally agreed standard atmosphere is used for assessing the performance of altimeters, aeroplanes and other devices that change their position of height in the atmosphere.<br> 
 Sea level is the hypothetical level of the surface of the sea, the ordnance datum, and the barometric standard.<br> 
 When bubbles form in a liquid, the vapour pressure inside the bubble is slightly greater than the atmospheric pressure above the liquid.<br> 
 The hole in the barrels of ball point pens is to allow equal pressure inside the pen with atmospheric pressure to help prevent ink leakage.<br>

 Record the weight, e.g. 2.1 g.<br> 
 Deflate the balloon and weigh again, e.g. 1.9 g.<br> 
 The weight is less than before, because air exerts the weight force.<br> 
 The first weight is less than the true weight, because a balloon has a 
large volume in relation to its mass.<br> 
 So you have noticed a significant upward force due to buoyancy.<br> 
 You live in a "sea of air", but you can usually disregard the effect of 
buoyancy when you weigh things, because the volume of what you 
 are weighing is small in comparison to its mass.<br> 
 The pressure inside the balloon is greater than atmospheric pressure, because the elastic rubber compressing the air inside the balloon.<br>

 Water does not replace the air in the tube.<br> 
 Remove the finger and water enters the tube.<br> 
 Replace the finger on the top of the tube and then lift the tube from

 The water remains in the tube, because the effect of the air pressure 
up the tube is greater than the weight of the water.<br> 
 Remove your finger and the water falls out of the tube.<br> 
 Tap the glass tube or straw against the side of the container so that
 one or two drops of water fall out leaving a small space between 
 the surface of the water and the finger.<br> 
 The air in this small space is at a much lower pressure than atmospheric
 pressure if the water stays in the tube.<br> 
 Remove your finger and the water falls out of the tube due to its own

 Air supports water in a glass tube or drinking straw.<br> 
 The external air pressure acts with uniform force in every direction 
in space.<br> 
 In this experiment it applies pressure from below against the column 
of water in the glass tube.<br> 
 The weight of the water creates a reduction in pressure between the water 
and the finger, since this pressure is lower than atmospheric 
 pressure the water cannot flow out of the bottom of the tube.<br> 
 When you remove the finger, the pressure above the water is the same 
as the pressure below the water and as a result the water flows 
 out of the tube.<br>

 a pipette to transfer known volumes of liquid.<br>

 If a vacuum exists above a non-volatile liquid then the maximum height 
 it could be sucked up would be when the hydrostatic head of 
 pressure = 1 atmosphere, i.e. 101, 325 pascals.<br> 
 Pressure = hdg, i.e. height (m) × density of water (1000 kg per cubic
 metre) × g, acceleration due to gravity 
 ( 9.81 metres per second per second) = 10.33 metres.<br> 
 However, at a room temperature of 27<sup>o</sup>C (80.6<sup>o</sup>F)
 water has a vapour pressure of 3, 536 pascals.<br> 
 It would begin to boil before a vacuum is reached.<br> 
 So maximum vapour pressure you could apply by sucking = 
 101, 325 - 3, 536 = 97.789 pascals, and maximum height = 9.97 metres.<br> 
 Some high school students can suck up to 2 metres vertical height while 
 other students can double this height by first sucking, 
 sealing the end of the drinking straw with the tongue, breathing out, 
 then sucking again.<br> 
 However, the tongue may get stuck at the end of the drinking straw and

 cloth, water and the outside of the glass.<br> 
 Also the space above the water in the glass has air pressure less than 
 air pressure.<br> 
 Water has stopped flowing through the wet cloth, because of the forces
 of cohesion between water molecules in the holes in the cloth 
 and the forces of adhesion between the water in the holes and the cloth.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">7. Fill a drinking glass 3/4 with water and cover 
 with a dry cotton cloth, e.g. a clean handkerchief.<br> 
 Pick up the glass with one hand and use the other hand to pull the cloth 
 edges under it.<br> 
 Put the glass on the table and press down on the centre of the cloth 
until it just touches the surface of the water to form a concave 
 shape.<br> 
 Invert the glass.<br> 
 Water does not passes through the cloth, which keeps its concave shape.<br> 
 While holding the glass in the same inverted position use the other hand 
to pull up the cloth so that it is tight and straight across the 
 mouth of the glass, like a drumhead.<br> 
 Water does not pass through the cloth, but the upper surface of the water 
 drops down in the glass to form a horizontal surface as air 
 passes up through the cloth then through the water as small bubbles.<br> 
 The water appears to be boiling.<br> 
 When the cloth is moved down the water follows it down, because of its
 own weight leaving a vacuum between the water and the 
 bottom of the inverted glass.<br>

 1. Press the force cup against a flat surface, e.g. the top of a stool.<br> 
 Try to lift the stool with the force cup.<br> 
 The force cup works better if it is wet.<br> 
 Press the force cup against a flat surface such as the top of a stool.<br> 
 The force cup works, because most of the air between the force cup and
 the stool surface was pushed out when the force cup was 
 pushed onto the stool surface.<br> 
 Thus the air pressure inside the force cup is less than outside and as 
a result atmospheric pressure pushes together the cup and stool.<br> 
 The force cup works, because almost no air remains between the object 
and the force cup.<br> 
 However, the air in the atmosphere is pressing down on the rubber with 
 atmospheric pressure.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">2. A rubber suction disc stays on a smooth window

 The force cup works, because there is no air between the object and the

 Press the rubber cups tightly together.<br>

 Pulling the force cups apart needs two strong students.<br> 
 When the force cups are pushed together some air is pushed out of the cavity between the two cups leading to a lower pressure being produced in the cavity.<br> 
 Since this pressure is less than the pressure outside the cavity, the
 cups are pushed together by atmospheric pressure.<br>

 Fill a Petri dish with water.<br> 
 Push it against a smooth surface, e.g. under side of a desk, but leave
 no air bubbles in it.<br> 
 The Petri dish sticks to the surface.<br> 
 By filling the dish with water, there is no air left and no air pressure 
 working down on the dish.<br> 
 The force down on the Petri dish is the weight of the Petri dish plus
 the water.<br> 
 The force up on the dish against the surface is equal to the air pressure
 of about 1 kg per cm<sup>2 </sup>of dish surface area.<br> 
 A dish with a 3 cm radius will have a force of about 27 kg holding it
 up minus the weight of the water and up the dish itself.<br> 
 A dish sticking to the surface will stay there until water evaporates
 and air seeps into the dish.<br> 
 The water acts as a seal to prevent the air to coming into the dish.<br>

 See: <a href="./commercial/Commercial3.html#Vacuum">Vacuum</a>, (Commercial).<br> 
 A vacuum cleaner uses an air pump to create a partial vacuum over a dirty 
 carpet.<br> 
 The vacuum cleaner is really a wind machine the forces a current of air 
 with a propeller.<br> 
 The partial vacuum occurs only when the inlet nozzle of the vacuum cleaner 
 is pressed down on something.<br> 
 Air rushes in to replace the air pumped out and when it is pumped away 
 it takes with it the dirt from the carpet.<br> 
 When the vacuum cleaner is used on a smooth surface., e.g. linoleum, 
the nozzle with the brush is used to raise the inlet above the 
 smooth surface.<br> 
 The smooth surface nozzle is used for carpets would just stick to the
 smooth linoleum and no current of air would form to carry dirt 
 from the surface.<br> 
 It is almost impossible to pump all the air out of an enclosed space 
to create a vacuum.<br> 
 The more air removed the greater the force from the atmospheric pressure 
 to replace it.<br>

 "Magdeburg Cups", pair of Magdeburg hemispheres (toy product)<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">A famous experiment at Magdeburg, Germany in 1654, by Otto von Guericke (1602 - 1686) showed that two teams of horses could not separate a pair of large copper cups, Magdeburg Hemispheres, from which air had been removed by boiling water in them.<br> 
 Otto von Guericke disproved the idea that "Nature abhors a vacuum" (Spinosa, 
 1677, in <i>Ethics</i>) to show that a vacuum creates no 
 force by itself, but is just an absence of air and any other substance.<br> 
 He invented the vacuum pump in 1654.<br> 
 It has many applications, including vacuum tubes for medical and dental
 suction, milking machines, freeze drying and gas discharge 
 tubes that contain gas at low pressure, used in electronics.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Experiments<a href="./images/12.3.5.7.gif"><br>
 See diagram 12.3.5.7</a>: Magdeburg hemispheres.<br> 
 1. Use two identical drinking glasses.<br> 
 Cut a square piece of newspaper with diameter 1 cm greater than the diameter 
of the open end of a glass.<br> 
 Dip the paper in water to make is just damp and place it over the first 
 glass.<br> 
 Put a small candle in the bottom of the other second glass.<br> 
 Light the candle in the second glass then invert the first glass with
 attached damp paper over it.<br> 
 The rims of the two glasses must touch exactly.<br> 
 The candle flame is extinguished when all the oxygen in the glass is 
converted to carbon dioxide.<br> 
 Lift the top glass and the bottom glass also rises.<br> 
 It may be difficult to separate the two glasses so you may have to twist 
 the glasses to break the partial vacuum.<br> 
 The previous explanation of the origin of the partial vacuum in this 
experiment was that the candle flame had "used up" or "consumed" 
 the oxygen in the glass.<br> 
 However, the product of the burning is carbon dioxide and water vapour.<br> 
 A more likely explanation is that the candle flame had heated the air
 in the glass so that it had expanded and some air had left the glass.<br> 
 When the flame was extinguished, because of lack of oxygen, the remaining 
 air in the glass had cooled and contracted leaving a partial 
 vacuum in both glasses.<br> 
 Some of the air in the top glass had diffused through the damp newspaper 
 to equalize the partial vacuum in the two glasses.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">2. Apply a layer of grease to the rim of the hemispheres 
 before pressing them together.<br> 
 After evacuation close the valve and remove the sphere from the vacuum 
 pump.<br> 
 Students may attempt to pull the sphere apart.<br> 
 After opening the valve, the hemispheres can easily be separated.<br> 
 Separate the hemispheres by placing the apparatus in a bell jar and evacuating 
it with an electric vacuum pump.<br> 
 The hemispheres fall apart.<br>

 drinking straw through a potato<br>
<a href="./images/4.228x.gif">See diagram 4.228</a>: Push a drinking straw through a potato.<br> 
 1. Put the index finger over one end of a drinking straw.<br> 
 Hold a potato in the other hand.<br> 
 Push the drinking straw quickly through the potato.<br> 
 The air in the drinking straw is trapped between the index finger and
 the potato when the end of the drinking straw strikes the potato.<br> 
 This compressed air gives the drinking straw enough strength to prevent
 its bending and keep it rigid.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">2. Try to push a drinking straw through a potato 
 and find that the straw is too weak and collapses.<br> 
 The straw is not rigid enough to take the compression.<br> 
 Now place your index finger over one end of a drinking straw, and push 
 the straw quickly through the potato.<br> 
 The straw now penetrates the potato successfully and, with practise, 
you can push the straw completely through the potato!<br>
 The air in the straw is trapped between the index finger and the potato
 when the end of the straw strikes the potato.<br> 
 This compressed air gives rigidity to that end of the straw to prevent 
its bending.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">3. Hold a potato and press 4 cm from one end of 
a drinking straw on it so that it points to the centre of the potato.<br> 
 Hit the other end of the straw very hard with the other hand.<br> 
 It can go through the potato.<br> 
 So you do not need to put your thumb over the end of the straw.<br> 
 Drinking straws are long cylinders with thin walls so they are quite 
sharp.<br> 
 To test the strength of a drinking straw use both hands to push the ends 
of a straw towards each other.<br> 
 If you block the end of the drinking straw with your thumb when you push 
it into a potato, the increased air pressure may split the straw!<br>
 4. Use a gardening glove to hold a drinking straw in the middle pinched 
 between the index finger and the thumb.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Stab the drinking straw into, and perhaps through, 
 an uncooked potato.<br> 
 Pressure = force / area.<br> 
 The area of the edge of the drinking straw is small, so the pressure 
on the potato is great.<br> 
 The smaller the area, the greater the exerted pressure.<br>

 Stop heating then put a small beaker, mouth down into the large beaker.<br> 
 Note the level of water inside the small floating beaker.<br> 
 Heat the large beaker again for a few minutes.<br> 
 During this heating note the movement of the small beaker and movement of any bubbles.<br> 
 Stop heating and note the level of the water inside the small beaker 
again.<br> 
 The level of water rises in the small beaker.<br> 
 Water vapour drives out air when the water is boiling.<br> 
 As the small beaker cools, the water vapour condenses to water.<br> 
 The level of water in the small beaker rises to replace the air displaced 
 by the water vapour.<br>

 Keep boiling, but do not let the 100 mL inverted beaker tip over.<br> 
 Let the beakers cool to room temperature.<br> 
 Observe the water level in the small beaker.<br> 
 Note what is inside the inverted small beaker before the heating.<br> 
 Note what happens to the water when it boils.<br> 
 The small beaker keep bobbing up and dawn.<br> 
 Note the bubbles.<br> 
 The water level rises in the small beaker.<br> 
 After the heating, you put a few drops of cold water on the small inverted 
 beaker.<br> 
 Boiling water changes from the liquid state into the gaseous or vapour 
 state.<br> 
 The water vapour formed under the inverted beaker replaces air.<br> 
 The longer the water boils the more air is replaced by water vapour.<br> 
 When the inverted beaker cools, the water vapour in it condenses to water 
 reducing the pressure inside so water is pushed up inside 
 the inverted beaker by the higher atmospheric pressure.<br> 
 Pour cold water on the inverted beaker to increase cooling and the rising 
 of the water.<br>

 that has not been opened.<br> 
 It is very difficult to suck the drink through the hole or to pour the 
 drink into a glass.<br> 
 Make a second hole in the beverage can.<br> 
 Now it is easy to suck the drink through the hole or to pour the drink
 into a glass.<br> 
 Sucking reduces pressure at one hole in the can so the air pressure acting 
through the second hole forces drink into your mouth or

 Pick up the board.<br> 
 The dish full of water sticks to the board.<br> 
 If the weight of the water and the dish is less than the force due to

 1. Use a flat-sided screw top tin can with a tightly fitting cap that
 has been thoroughly rinsed then left open to dry.<br> 
 Put a few centimetres of water in the tin can.<br> 
 With the cap off, heat the water until it boils and steam comes out.<br> 
 Stop heating and immediately hold the tin can with a dry cloth to screw 
 on the cap very tightly using insulated gloves.<br> 
 You may use petroleum jelly to get a tight seal.<br> 
 Allow the tin can to cool by putting it under a cold water tap or covering 
 with a wet towel.<br> 
 The sides of the can will slowly collapse inwards.<br> 
 When the water boils, the steam drives the air from the tin.<br> 
 When cool, the steam condenses to form water again, causing much lower
 pressure inside the tin than outside it.<br> 
 The tin can collapses, because the external pressure is greater than the 
internal pressure.<br> 
 So there are more air molecules pushing the sides of the can in than 
there are molecules inside the can pushing the sides out.<br> 
 A rectangular tin can is better for the experiment than a round tin can 
because flat surfaces are more easily affected by changes in 
 pressure than curved surfaces.<br>

 The can is crushed by the atmospheric pressure and water pressure on

 If there is no seal between the open end of the can and the bottom of
 the bucket, the partial vacuum in the can will draw in water and 
 the can will not collapse.<br>

 Hold the drink bottle under a tap to pour water over it.<br> 
 The sides of the drink bottle collapse inwards crushed by the difference

 When the drink bottle was half filled with hot water, the air in the

 Give the other end of the flat stick a sharp blow.<br> 
 The flat stick breaks over the edge of the table.<br>

 Hit the end of the stick with a sharp blow.<br> 
 The stick breaks over the edge of the table.<br> 
 Little air remains under the smoothed down newspaper paper, but full atmospheric

 1. Insert two lengths of glass tubing, one straight and one with a right 
 angle bend, into a two hole stopper.<br> 
 Attach a small balloon to the lower end of the straight tube.<br> 
 Fix the stopper with attached balloon into a glass jar.<br> 
 Suck through the bent glass tube until the balloon is inflated.<br> 
 The atmospheric air pressure acting through the straight tube is inflating
 the balloon.<br> 
 Close the end of the bent tube with your finger.<br> 
 The balloon remains inflated.<br> 
 The pressure inside the balloon is atmospheric pressure.<br> 
 The pressure inside the jar is lower than atmospheric pressure.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">2. Remove your finger from the end of the bent tube.<br> 
 The balloon deflates.<br> 
 Blow through the straight tube.<br> 
 The balloon inflates.<br> 
 Put your finger over the end of the straight tube.<br> 
 The balloon remains inflated.<br> 
 The pressure inside the balloon is now higher than the atmospheric pressure.<br> 
 The pressure inside the jar is at atmospheric pressure acting through
 the bent tube.<br>

 Suspend an inflated tyre with a heavy duty spring and let the air out.<br> 
 Place a large evacuated glass flask on a balance then let air in and 
note the increased weight.<br> 
 Tape a one litre flask on a balance then pump out.<br> 
 The loss of weight is about one gram.<br> 
 Weight a glass sphere on a pan balance then evacuate it and weigh again.<br>

 Hollow out a suction cup in the bottom of a cork so it will stay stuck
 at the bottom of a beaker as you add water.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.3.27H"></a>12.3.27 Egg in a bottle<br>
<a href="./images/12.3.27.jpg">See diagram 12.3.27</a>: Egg in a bottle.<br> 
 1. Cover a fresh egg with vinegar or dilute acid hydrochloric acid.<br> 
 Change the solutions each day for 2 to 7 days.<br> 
 The dilute acid dissolves most of the egg shell or bone composed mainly
 of calcium carbonate.<br> 
 Pick up the decalcified egg and drop it to show that it will bounce and 
not beak.<br> 
 Boil water in a flask.<br> 
 The steam in the flask forces out some of the air.<br> 
 Stop heating after boiling for 5 minutes then immediately put the egg
 with no shell in the opening of the flask.<br> 
 Hold the flask in the sink and wash it with water from the cold tap.<br> 
 The steam cools to form water drops that takes up less space and reduce
 the air pressure inside the flask.<br> 
 The soft egg will squeeze down the neck of the flask, because the atmospheric
 pressure is greater than the pressure in the flask.<br> 
 The egg is not "sucked" into the bottle!<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">2. Peel the shell off a hard-boiled egg then put 
 the peeled egg narrower end down end in the mouth of bottle with a fairly 
 wide mouth, e.g. a milk bottle.<br> 
 Light a small piece of paper or a match, lift up the egg, drop the burning 
 paper into the bottle and replace the egg.<br> 
 The egg trembles as hot air leaves the bottle then the flame goes out
 and the egg is pushed into the bottle, because the atmospheric 
 pressure is greater than the pressure of gases in the bottle.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">3. Peel the shell off a hard-boiled egg then put 
 the peeled egg narrower end down end in the mouth of bottle with a fairly 
 wide mouth, e.g. a milk bottle.<br> 
 Drop burning paper or a lighted match into the bottle, wait until it 
stops burning, then immediately place the egg on the opening.<br> 
 The warmed air starts to cool when the burning stops and the egg seals
 the opening so the air pressure in the bottle decreases as the 
 cooling continues.<br> 
 Get the egg out by inverting the bottle so that the egg sits inside the 
mouth.<br> 
 Then warm the bottle to make it expand and the egg is pushed out.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">4. Blow upwards on the egg or use a jet of compressed air to create negative pressure below
 the egg so that the egg is pushed out by the pressure of gases in the bottle 
 or blown upwards.<br> 
 This is an application of the Bernoulli force.<br> 
 Hold the bottle with its mouth near your mouth with its bottom slightly 
 higher so that the egg is in the neck of the bottle, but not 
 completely blocking the neck.<br> 
 You must exhale a huge burst of breath to suddenly increase the inside 
 air pressure.<br> 
 The Bernoulli effect of the reduction of in air pressures at right angles 
 to the air stream flow direction caused by the movement of air 
 around the egg and the increased air pressure will push the egg out of 
the bottle.<br> 
 Some people can catch the egg in their mouth then eat it!<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.3.27.1H"></a>12.3.27.1 Balloon pushed 
 into a flask<br>
 Boil water in a flask for 5 minutes then attach the mouth of a deflated 
 balloon to the mouth of the flask.<br> 
 Hold the flask in the sink and wash it with water from the cold tap.<br> 
 Atmospheric pressure pushes the balloon into the flask.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.3.28H"></a>12.3.28 Expanded balloon
 with cup "ears"<br>
 1. Use your breath to partly inflate a round balloon so that it is nearly 
 spherical.<br> 
 Wet the mouths of two identical plastic cups and hold them each side 
of the balloon, like "ears".<br> 
 Inflate the balloon further while using your hands to keep hold of the 
 cups and press slightly inwards.<br> 
 Ask another person to tie a string around the mouth of the balloon and 
 hold the end of the string.<br> 
 Take your hand off the cups so that the balloon is held up only by the 
 string.<br> 
 The cups stick to the balloon.<br> 
 When you inflated the balloon with the cups pressed in you increased 
the volume of air in the cups as the curvature of the balloon 
 became less.<br> 
 The pressure of air in the cups became less than atmospheric pressure.<br> 
 Atmospheric pressure acting on the outside of the cups kept them pressed
 in on the balloon, like "ears".<br> 
 Slowly release the string to let air out of the balloon.<br> 
 At a certain decreased curvature of the balloon, the cups fall off.<br> 
 Some teachers have reported no success with this experiment.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">2. Inflate up a balloon to large orange size and 
 pinch the inlet.<br> 
 Wet the rims of two identical plastic containers, e.g. small jam containers.<br> 
 Lay the containers on their sides each side of the balloon, with open
 ends touching the balloon.<br> 
 Press the containers in on the balloon while a second person inflates
 the balloon more.<br> 
 More inflation causes the curvature of the balloon in contact to decrease, 
 and the air pressure inside the containers to decrease as the 
 volume within increases.<br> 
 Use this procedure to attach more plastic containers to the balloon.<br> 
 Pick up the balloon with containers attached.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.3.29H"></a>12.3.29 "Cupping"<br>
See: <a href="./commercial/Commercial3.html#Vacuum">Vacuum</a> (Commercial).<br> 
 A now discarded and probably useless medical treatment was called "cupping".<br> 
 Wide mouth cups were heated internally with a candle then placed mouth
 downwards on the patients skin.<br> 
 The heated air in the cups cooled causing a partial vacuum leaving a 
red area of skin where the capillaries had expanded.<br> 
 This procedure was supposed to draw out the bad "humours", which in those 
 days were thought to cause disease.<br> 
 The procedure is still practised in some countries in Asia.<br> 
 Do not ask students to do this, but teachers who are brave or foolhardy 
 enough can drop a piece of burning paper into a small beaker 
 or drinking glass, then press the mouth of the beaker against the palm<br> 
 of the hand or forehead so that the flame goes out!.<br> 
 The beaker will stick to the skin and leave a red mark.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.3.30H"></a>12.3.30 Bottles stick together<br>
See: <a href="./commercial/Commercial.html#Bottles">Bottles</a> (Commercial).<br> 
 1. Put a piece of wet filter paper or absorbent paper over the mouth of a bottle.<br> 
 Light a twisted piece of paper and drop it into an identical bottle.<br> 
 Immediately invert the bottle with the wet filter paper over it.<br> 
 Press down on the top bottle so that the wet filter paper forms a seal between the mouths of the two bottles and the flame goes out.<br> 
 You can now lift both bottles by grabbing only the top bottle.<br> 
 Similarly you can invert the two bottles and lift up both bottles by holding the other bottle on top.<br> 
2. If you try to repeat the experiment with dry filter paper between the bottles it does not work, because air can get in through the dry paper.<br>
