<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="28.1.1H">28.1.1</a> Light, speed of light, nature of light, shadows<br>
Speed of light, C, Einstein was right, e = mc2<br>
1. Speed of light = 3 x 108 m/s<br>
<a href="../images/28.1.1.2m.gif">See diagram 28.1.1.2:</a> Speed of light.<br>
 In transparent materials, the speed of light is less than it is in a vacuum.<br>
 Léon Foucault, France, 1819 - 1868, first used rotating and fixed mirrors to measure the speed of light.<br>
 Albert Michelson, USA, 1852-1931, improved on this method to get a more accurate measurement.<br>
Speed of light in a vacuum (universal constant) c = 2.99792458 × 10<sup>8</sup>
 m / sec, to three significant figures: c = 3.00 × 10<sup>8</sup> m / sec, 
 (6.71 X 10<sup>8</sup> miles per hour, USA).<br>
2. Waveform<br>
Light as a pair of transverse waves, electric field and magnetic field.<br>
<a href="../images/28.1.1.gif">See diagram 28.1.1</a>: Electric and magnetic fields.<br>
All electromagnetic radiation, including light can be polarized, so light must have a transverse waveform.<br>
An electromagnetic wave arises from accelerating charges and travels only at 3 × 10<sup>8 </sup>m / sec in a vacuum.<br>
 The wave has a changing electric field and a changing magnetic field at 90<sup>o </sup>to each other.<br>
3. Dual nature of light<br>
* Light behaves as a line of particles, so light travels in straight lines as rays, e.g. reflection.<br>
<a href="../images/28.2.2d.gif">See diagram 28.2.2d</a>: Reflection in a plane mirror.<br>
* Light behaves as a wave, so light has wavefronts, e.g. refraction and diffraction.<br>
<a href="../images/25.04.gif">See diagram 25.04</a>: Wavefronts.<br>
4. Visible light<br>
<a href="../images/28.133.gif">See diagram 28.133</a>: Electromagnetic spectrum.<br>
<a href="../images/28.134.2.gif">See diagram 28.134.2</a>: Diffraction grating.<br>
Visible light is part of the electromagnetic radiation spectrum made up of (increasing frequencies, decreasing wavelengths) radio waves, 
 microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and γ-rays.<br>
5. Production of light<br>
Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation that a physical change can produce, such as the heating of an object, or a chemical change, e.g. burning 
magnesium.<br>
6. Shadows<br>
Light travels in straight lines and causes shadows when an object is placed in the path of the light.<br>
<a href="../images/28.105.3.gif">See diagram 28.105.3</a>: Shadows.<br>
<a href="../images/28.105.3.1.gif">See diagram 28.105.3.1</a>: Shadow game.<br>
Light travels in straight lines causing shadows when barriers much larger than the wavelength of light are placed in the path of the light.<br>
A full shadow is called the umbra and partial shadow is called the penumbra.<br>
Experiment<br>
On a sunny day observe the shadow of a tall vertical pole, e.g. a flag pole.<br>
At its base the shadow has sharp edges, because it is umbra and no penumbra.<br>
The shadow of further up the pole has less and less sharp edges with more and more penumbra and less umbra.<br>
7. Reflection<br>
Diffuse reflection of light occurs at surfaces that are not flat.<br>
Specular reflection occurs at polished surfaces.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="28.1.2H">28.1.2</a> Absorption spectrum of sodium<br>
1. When white light passes through a vapour of atoms, they absorb their characteristic wavelengths of light and reduce these wavelengths in the 
 continuous spectrum emitted to produce a line absorption spectrum.<br>
White light from the sun travels through cooler elements surrounding it that absorb their characteristic wavelengths.<br>
The dark absorption lines in this line absorption spectrum, i.e, solar spectrum, identifies these elements, e.g. Helium.<br>
2. Heat a wire coated in sodium chloride in a Bunsen burner flame and placed in front of a sodium light source.<br>
The sodium vapour from the heated wire appears as a black mist, because of its absorption of the characteristic wavelengths of sodium.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="28.1.3H">28.1.3</a> Candoluminescence<br>
Candoluminescence is the light from heating substances with a flame to a high temperature so that some wavelengths are more than expected by 
black body emission at that temperature.<br>
This occurs in some transition metals and rare earth metal oxides, e.g. zinc oxide, cerium oxide, thorium dioxide.<br>
Carl Auer, later Freiherr von Welsbach, 1858-1929, Austria, invented the Welsbach gas mantle containing thorium nitrate and cerium nitrate to 
 increase light from gas lamps.<br>
Gas mantles are pieces of fabric soaked in metal oxides.<br>
They were used for gas lighting in homes, but nowadays are used only for gas pressure lamps for outdoors work and camping.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="28.1.4H">28.1.4</a> Emission spectrum<br>
 If individual atoms of an element receive enough energy, they produce a characteristic line emission spectrum.<br>
 Each element emits characteristic lines of radiation with specific wavelengths.<br>
 Compounds contain more than one kind of atom, so they produce a band emission spectrum.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="28.1.5H">28.1.5</a> Focal length of a convex lens<br>
Experiments<br>
1. Attach a sheet of white paper on a wall opposite a bright window with the sun not visible, because it is behind an outside object, e.g. a tree.<br>
The light rays passing through the window from the distant sun will be almost parallel.<br>
Hold a convex lens vertically about 5 cm from the paper the move it in a straight line towards the window until a clear image of the window appears 
on the white paper at a distance of the focal length of the lens.<br>
2. Focus energy at a focal point<br>
Use a magnifier to focus sunlight on your arm.<br>
Is the hottest spot on your arm the brightest spot?<br>
<b>Be careful!</b><br>
3. Remove the projection head of an overhead projector and hold a piece of paper at the focal point until it bursts into flame.<br>

 <hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="28.1.6H">28.1.6</a> Incandescent lamp<br>
 Light may be directed into a room by using an abatjour skylight or lamp.<br>
 Hot solids or liquids emit wavelengths of radiation depending on the temperature as a continuous spectrum.<br>
 At lower temperatures they emit red wavelengths, so the metal appears to be "red hot".<br>
 At higher temperatures, they emit the full visible spectrum as white light, so the metal appears to be "white hot" or "incandescent".<br>
 The incandescent filament in an electric light globe, a filament lamp, is "white hot".<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="28.1.8H">28.1.8</a> Low voltage light source<br>
 Make a compact light source from any small, high intensity electric light bulb that has a short, straight filament,
 e.g, light bulbs used in  car tail lamps.<br>
 Use a small light source to make very sharp shadows with the light bulb  filament end on.<br>
 Cover the light source with a small beverage can.<br>
 Darken the room.<br>
 Punch 2 mm diameter holes in the beverage can on all sides.<br>
 Blow smoke around the can to make the emerging rays visible.<br>
 Make enough holes so that you can see clearly where the light comes from and in what direction it travels.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="28.1.9H">28.1.9</a> Make a model electric light bulb (incandescent filament lamp)<br>
<a href="../images/28.65x.gif">See diagram 28.65x</a>: Heat and light from electricity.<br>
 1. Push the ends of two pieces of copper wire through a cork in a small bottle.<br>
 Connect the ends of the copper wire inside the bottle with a stand of steel wool.<br>
 Connect this model electric lamp model in a circuit with one or more dry cells, or lead cell accumulators, and a switch.<br>
 Close the switch until the fine wire filament begins to glow.<br>
 At first the heated iron wire produces light, but soon the iron combines  with the oxygen of the air inside the bottle and burns.<br>
 2. Examine a manufactured electric light bulb.<br>
 It contains argon, but no oxygen.<br>
 It has a tungsten carbide wire filament that glows without burning when  heated to a high temperature.<br>
 The argon restrains the blackening of the inside of the bulb by deposition  of tungsten vapour.<br>
 Fluorescent lamps containing mercury vapour or neon gas are much more energy-efficient than incandescent lamps.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="28.1.10H">28.1.10</a> Light rays through lenses<br>
<a href="../images/28.120.gif">See diagram 28.120</a>: Ray diagrams for lenses.<br>
<a href="../images/28.217.gif">See diagram 28.217</a>: Image with a convex.<br>
<a href="../images/28.8.0.gif">See diagram 28.8.0</a>: Make a diverging lens.<br>
<a href="../images/28.8.3.gif">See diagram 28.8.3</a>: Focal length of a concave lens.<br>
Ray diagrams to show the formation of images by lenses A Real, inverted, diminished image, B Real, inverted, same size image, C Real, inverted, 
magnified image, D Virtual, erect magnified image, E Concave lens, virtual, erect, diminished image 
Parallel rays of light that pass through a convex lens, converging lens, all pass through the principle focus, F.<br>
Parallel rays of light that pass through a concave, diverging lens, diverge as if coming from the principle focus, F.<br>
In the diagram, 1 to 4 are convex lenses that form real images when the object is more than one focal length from the lens.<br>
For the lens, the image forming properties depends on refraction through the lens material thus the focal length will depend both on geometric factors 
 and the index of refraction of material of the lens.<br>
Light rays come from a distant object.<br>
The object is twice the focal length from the lens.<br>
The object is between the focal length and twice the focal length from the lens.<br>
The object is less than the focal length from the lens.<br>
A concave always produces the same kind of image.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="28.1.11H">28.1.11</a> Light travels in straight lines<br>
<a href="../images/28.105.1.gif">See diagram 28.105.1</a>: Light travels in straight lines.<br>
1. Make a pinhole magnifier.<br>
 Cut a very small hole through a piece of cardboard with a pin.<br>
 Hold the cardboard very close to the eye in good light and look through  the hole at some small print.<br>
 The print appears larger and clearer, because light rays pass through the small hole then spread out.<br>
 The small hole functions like a camera shutter keeping out the extra light that would make the image blurred.<br>
2. Look down on a tightly closed fist.<br>
 Open the fist very slightly to let the smallest amount of light pass through.<br>
 Look at some fine print through the fist.<br>
 Move the fist up and down to get the best magnification.<br>
3. Pierce a hole with the pin in the centre of a piece of cardboard.<br>
 Hold it 10 cm in front of one eye.<br>
 Hold the pin between the card and the eye.<br>
 See an upside down image of the pin will be observed.<br>
4. Make a pinhole in a sheet of aluminium foil.<br>
 Hold the aluminium foil between a lighted candle and the wall.<br>
 See the inverted image of the candle flame on the wall.<br>
5. Hold the hole in the cardboard 3 cm from the  eye.<br>
 Keep the eyelid almost closed.<br>
 See inverted images of the eyelashes.<br>
 All objects will cast an upside down image on the retina when the eye is focussed on them.<br>
 The brain interprets the upside down image as right side up.<br>
6. Make a pinhole in the middle of one end of a rectangular box, e.g. a shoe box.<br>
 Cut a window in the other end of the box and use adhesive tape to attach over it a screen made of greaseproof paper, lunch wrap  paper, baking paper.<br>
 Draw the letter T on a piece of thin white paper, or greaseproof paper  using a marker pen.<br>
 Attach the paper with the T drawn on it to the front of a light source.<br>
 In a dark room, direct light from the light source towards the pinhole  and, at the other end of the box, look at the image on the screen.<br>
 The image of the T is inverted.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="28.1.12H">28.1.12</a> Luminance and illuminance<br>
Luminous intensity, C, is a measure of the brightness of a light source, i.e. how much light emitted per second, and measured in the candela, cd, formerly candle power.<br>
 Luminance, L, measures the brightness of a surface in candela per square metre.<br>
 A source of light measuring one candela emits one lumen of light, 1 lm.<br>
 Illuminance, or illumination, I, is a measure of the quantity of light falling on a surface at a distance from the light source, and measured in lux lx.<br>
 Illuminance is directly proportional to luminous intensity, C, and inversely  proportional to the square of the distance, d, from the light  source, I = C / d<sup>2</sup>.<br>
 One lux is the illumination of one lumen per square metre.<br>
 One lux is the brightness at one metre from 1 candela light source.<br>
 Light meters, exposure meters, used in photography, measure illuminance  in the unit lux.<br>
Experiment<br>
<a href="../images/28.10.11m.gif">See diagram 28.10.11m</a>: Projected filament with lens.<br>
Turn on the light bulb.<br>
 Move the light bulb to focus the image on the side wall.<br>
 The focal lengths are marked on the lenses.<br>
 Show the effect of aperture size on the sharpness on the focus by placing different-sized stops in front of the lens.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="28.1.13H">28.1.13</a> Sources of light<br>
Make a compact light source from any small, high intensity electric light bulb that has a short, straight filament, e.g. light bulbs used in  car tail lamps.<br>
 Use a small light source to make very sharp shadows with the light bulb filament end on.<br>
 Cover the light source with a small beverage can.<br>
 Darken the room.<br>
 Punch 2 mm diameter holes in the beverage can on all sides.<br>
 Blow smoke around the can to make the emerging rays visible.<br>
 Make enough holes so that you can see clearly where the light comes from and in what direction it travels.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="28.1.14H">28.1.14</a> Dispersion spectrum with a ray box<br>
Dispersion with a triangular prism.<br>
Dispersion occurs when light of different wavelengths is spread out by a prism into a spectrum.<br>
Experiments<br>
1. Use a glass prism to produce a spectrum from a parallel beam of light.<br>
 Place a card with a narrow slit in front of the lens of a ray box.<br>
 Use colour filters to suppress certain colours, e.g. use a transparent
 purple filter so that you see only red and blue lines on the screen.<br>
2. Study light rays through a prism.<br>
 Hold a glass prism in a parallel beam of light and note how the beam refracts.<br>
 Rotate the prism on its axis.<br>
When white light splits into the colours of the spectrum, i.e. disperses the violet light end of the spectrum refracts more than the red light.<br>
 The refractive index of violet light is greater than the refractive index
of red light.<br>
 However, monochromatic light has only one colour and does not disperse.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="28.2.1H">28.2.1</a> Microscope as a micro projector<br>
 If a very bright light source is used, the image from the eyepiece of a compound microscope can be reflected on to a screen using a  mirror.<br>
 A powerful slide projector is a good source of light.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="28.2.2H">28.2.2</a> Model refracting telescope<br>
 Arrange a long focus lens on the end of an optical bench pointing at an object through the window.<br>
 Bring a piece of white cardboard up on the opposite side of the lens to the place where the sharpest image of the scene is formed.<br>
 Bring a short focus lens up behind the cardboard until the cardboard is a little nearer the lens than its focal length.<br>
 Remove the cardboard and look through the two lenses at the object.<br>

<a href="../images/28.219.gif">See diagram 28.219</a>: Optical bench for studying lenses.
An optical bench allows you to hold mirrors and lenses in position and to measure distances accurately with a metre scale.<br>
Experiments<br>
Use wooden or plastic blocks with grooves that just fit over the metre scale.<br>
Stick a pin into the centre of each block.<br>
Use strips of tin screwed to the side of the blocks to make lens holders.<br>
Attach a torch bulb to a block as a light source.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="28.2.4H">28.2.4</a> Projector for filmstrips or slides<br>
<a href="../images/28.1.20.gif">See diagram 28.1.20</a>: Projector.<br>
Experiments<br>
 The base of the instrument is a piece of plywood 40 × 10 × 3 cm.<br>
 A plywood board 10 cm wide and 25 cm long fits into a groove cut across  the base.<br>
 It serves as filmstrip carrier.<br>
 A hole 35 by 23 mm cut in this wood serves as an aperture or gate to limit the light passing to one frame of the strip.<br>
 Fix the strip close to the gate in a vertical position with staples made from wire paper clips.<br>
 Bent them to the width of the film and cut the ends short and sharpen them using a file.<br>
 Then press them into position on the plywood board.<br>
 No reels are necessary.<br>
 The strip can be moved on from one frame to the next by pulling on the end of the film until there is sufficient 'curl' to hold it stationary.<br>
 The lamp is a motor car head lamp in a holder mounted on a block.<br>
 It is adjustable so that it can be slid between two strips of wood nailed  to the base.<br>
 Use a carafe or flask of water as a condensing lens placed so that the whole of the gate is illuminated by the image of the lamp.<br>
 When so positioned, the lamp and condensing flask are fixed in place with glue.<br>
 Mount the object lens on a piece of wooden dowel that is a tight  fit in a hole drilled into a block of wood arranged, like the  lamp support, to
 slide between two wooden guides.<br>
 Adjust the lens by sliding the rod in or out of the hole so that the centre of the lamp, condenser and objective are all the same height  above the baseboard.<br>
 Use a plywood, metal or cardboard case to enclose the lamp and the condenser.<br>
 Use the apparatus in a darkened room.<br>

 The light source is a 12 V 24 watts, W, motor car lamp.<br>
 The lamp holder has a sleeve of brass tubing just fitting into a hole in a wooden slide, which forms the top of the box.<br>

 For most spherical and parabolic mirrors, all rays parallel to the principal axis through the mirror either meet at a point on the principal axis called 
 the principal focus, F, for converging or concave mirrors, or appear to come from such a point behind the mirror for diverging or convex mirrors.<br>
 The centre of curvature, C, for a spherical mirror is twice the distance of the principal focus, F, from the mirror.<br>
 Use the Cartesian co-ordinate sign convention: 1 / v + 1 / u =1 / f.<br>
 Real images from a concave mirror forms when the object is further than one focal length (distance f) from the mirror.<br>
 Where u is the object distance from the mirror, v is the image distance from the mirror, So is the object distance from the principal focus, Si is the 
 image distance from the principal focus, f is the focal length of the mirror, Ho is the height of the object, Hi is the height of the image.<br>
 Virtual images occur when the object is less than one focal f length from the concave mirror.<br>

Image is a picture or appearance of a real object, formed by light that passes through a lens or is reflected from a mirror.<br>
A real image is one through which rays of light actually pass and the image can form on a screen, e.g. images produced by a camera or projector 
 lens can be projected onto a screen.<br>
An image than cannot be projected onto a screen such as that seen in a flat mirror is called a virtual image.<br>
A virtual image is an image from which diverging rays of light appear to come.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="28.5.1H">28.5.1</a> Total internal reflection<br>
Experiments<br>
1. Put a short lighted candle behind a glass or plastic rectangular fish tank.<br>
Fill the fish tank with water to a level just above the wick.<br>
Look at right angles to the fish tank so that you can see the lighted candle directly opposite.<br>
 Raise and lower the level of your eye above and below the level of the water.<br>
 The top of the candle flame and the bottom of the candle flame around the wick are in one line.<br>
 Move your head to the left parallel to the front glass of the fish tank.<br>
 When your eye is above the water level, the top of the flame appears to move to the left.<br>
 When your eye is below the water level, the bottom of the flame appear to move to the left.<br>
The angle between a line from the candle at right angles to the fish tank, the normal, and your line of sight, the incident ray, is increasing.<br>
 For most glass, when this angle reaches about 43degrees, the critical  angle, the incident ray cannot pass into the water, so the image  disappears.<br>
 Return to the first position where you first looked at the candle directly  opposite you.<br>
 Lower your eye to the level of the bottom of the fish tank and look up at the bottom of the water surface.<br>
 See the reflection of the lower part of the candle that you saw when your eye was just below the level of the water.<br>
Light from the candle up to the surface of the water is at an angle greater than the critical angle is reflected at the water surface, total  internal reflection.<br>
2. Stand a spoon in a glass of water at the edge of the table.<br>
<a href="../images/9.127.2.gif">See diagram 28.1.27.2</a>: Spoon in water.<br>
 Look up from just below the table surface at the spoon pointing down towards you.<br>
The surface of the water acts like a mirror and so you see the reflection of the lower part of the spoon that is under water.<br>
 However, you cannot see the upper part of the spoon above water.<br>
3. Shine a light into one of the two sides of a right angle reflecting prism.<br>
The light reflects off the hypotenuse and passes out through the other side.<br>
The light reflects, because the angle of incidence at the hypotenuse is greater that the critical angle for crown glass, 43degrees.<br>
Reflecting prisms are used in binoculars, prismatic compasses and periscopes.<br>
Prisms allow you to see around corners!<br>
4. Drill a small hole in the side near the bottom of a tall beverage can and plug the hole.<br>
 Fill the beverage can with water and place it on the edge of a table over a basin.<br>
 Darken the room.<br>
 Shine an electric torch down into the beverage can.<br>
 Remove the plug to let the water stream fall into the basin.<br>
 The light from the torch bends with the falling stream to form a light  spot on the bottom of the basin, because of the total internal  reflection of light on 
 the interface between water and air.<br>
 Some rays are refracted to your eyes.<br>
 5. Use a light pipe, a curlicue-shaped methyl methacrylate (Lucite) rod to show critical angle and total internal reflection.<br>
<a href="../images/28.6.1m.gif">See diagram 28.6.1m</a>: Lucite light pipe.<br>
 Let light enter the rod at one end of the light pipe to strike its walls at an angle greater than the critical angle of Lucite.<br>
 The light does not escape through the walls, but is reflected between the walls of the rod until it reaches the other end.<br>
6. Trap and guide light by an unbroken stream of water flowing from a glass reservoir.<br>
<a href="../images/28.216.gif">See diagram 28.216</a>: "Pouring light".<br>
 Aim a torch light or laser beam at the back of a stopper, through the opposite side of the glass reservoir.<br>
 Remove the stopper so that the light is guided by the stream of water and causes a brilliant spot on a sloping white screen in a fish tank.<br>
7. Make an attractive table lamp by putting your light source facing upwards in a light proof container like a flower vase.<br>
Then place thin bending plastic tubes in the flower vase.<br>
8. Total internal reflection, fibre optic cable<br>
Fibre optics cable contains optical fibres that are fine strands of glass surrounded by "cladding" glass that bends any light rays that strike it back towards the centre of the optical fibre.<br>
Optical fibres allow you to see around corners, so surgeons may use optical fibres to see inside the body.<br>
An optical fibre cable containing thousands of separated strands of glass is used as a decorative lighting device.<br>
Experiment<br>
Glass rods.<br>
Use a Plexiglas rod, Plexiglas curly Q and a section of fibre optic cable.<br>
Hold their ends in the beam near the laser.<br>
Vary the number of reflections in the rod by changing the angle.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="28.5.2H">28.5.2</a> Critical angle and total internal reflection<br>
 Critical angle is the angle of incidence in a more dense medium, which produces an angle of refraction of 90 degrees in a less dense medium.<br>
 Total internal reflection occurs when the critical angle of incidence is exceeded.<br>
 Triangular prisms can change direction of light by total internal reflection  if the angle of incidence &gt; critical angle.<br>
 When a parallel beam of light from the lamp is aimed vertically upwards  from beneath the cylindrical clear plastic trough containing  water the beam
 is not deviated, but it passes straight up.<br>
 If the beam is aimed up at a small angle of incidence, i, then both an internally reflected beam, R, and a refracted beam, T, can be seen.<br>
 The beam, T, is passing from water to air, from a medium of higher optical density to lower optical density.<br>
 So the refraction is away from the normal, angle r &gt; angle i.<br>
 As the angle of incidence, i, is increased, r increases until the direction  of the transmitted beam, T, approaches the direction of the  surface of the water.<br>
 When i reaches the critical angle the refracted ray just grazes the surface of the water, so angle of refraction becomes 90degrees.<br>
 When i &gt; critical angle there is no refracted beam, because all the light is reflected as total internal reflection.<br>
 There is a sudden increase in the intensity of the reflected beam as the angle of incidence increases beyond the critical angle.<br>
 The critical angle is an angle of incidence in an optically more dense  medium, which produces an angle of refraction of 90 degrees in a less  dense medium.<br>
 When the critical angle of incidence is exceeded, there is no refracted  light at all, instead, all the light is totally internally reflected.<br>
Experiments<br>
1. Rotate a semicircular slab of Plexiglas with the light ray entering and exiting through the curved surface.<br>
Rotate the semicircular slab until the critical angle is reached and total internal reflection is obtained.<br>
2. Put a short lighted candle behind a glass or plastic rectangular fish tank.<br>
Fill the fish tank with water to a level just above the wick.<br>
Look at right angles to the fish tank so that you can see the lighted candle directly opposite.<br>
Raise and lower the level of your eye above and below the level of the water.<br>
The top of the candle flame and the bottom of the candle flame around the wick are in one line.<br>
Move your head to the left parallel to the front glass of the fish tank.<br>
When your eye is above the water level, the top of the flame appears to move to the left.<br>
When your eye is below the water level, the bottom of the flame appears to move to the left.<br>
The angle between a line from the candle at right angles to the fish tank, the normal, and your line of sight, the incident ray, is increasing.<br>
For most glass, when this angle reaches about 43degrees, the critical angle, the incident ray cannot pass into the water, so the image disappears.<br>
3. Return to the first position where you first looked at the candle directly opposite you.<br>
Lower your eye to the level of the bottom of the fish tank and look up at the bottom of the water surface.<br>
See the reflection of the lower part of the candle that you saw when your eye was just below the level of the water.<br>
Light from the candle up to the surface of the water is at an angle greater than the critical angle is reflected at the water surface, total internal reflection.<br>
4. <a href="../images/9.127.2.gif">See diagram 28.1.27.2</a>: Spoon in glass of water.<br>

<a href="../images/28.114.gif">See diagram 28.114</a>: Dispersion.<br>
 Diamonds have a small critical angle, because of the large refractive index.<br>
 Light tends to become trapped inside, because it may undergo total internal reflection more than once before refracting out of the diamond.<br>
 Most light rays approach the diamond at angles of incidence greater than the critical angle so the diamond tends to sparkle.<br>
 For total internal reflection, incoming light must strike the diamond face at an angle of more than 48degrees with the horizontal.<br>
 After the first reflection light striking the second inclined face is reflected if the face makes an angle of less than 43degrees 43' with the horizontal.<br>
 However, the angle to produce the best possible dispersion for reflective brilliance is 40degrees50'.<br>
 The sparkling effect can be enhanced by cutting a diamond gemstone with a planned shape.<br>
 The diagram shows the total internal reflection within a diamond gemstone with and without a planned shape.<br>
 Refractive index with air:<br>

 The light from the electric torch appears to pour out with the water.<br>
