<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="23.7.01H">23.7.01</a> Conduction of heat, thermal conductivity<br>
 The process of transformation of energy from one object to another is caused by heat motion of molecules and atoms and is called heat transfer.<br>
 Heat transfers from an object or a part of it in higher temperature to an object or a part of it in lower temperature.<br>
 When the temperatures of the two objects are equal, they are in a state of heat equilibrium.<br>
 Heat transfer can occur in solids, liquids and gases.<br>
<br>
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="23.7.1H">23.7.1</a> Water is a poor conductor of heat, boil water in a balloon<br>
 1. Boil water in a balloon.<br>
 Make a tripod big enough to suspend a balloon full of water over a burning candle.<br>
 Put aluminium foil on the table.<br>
 Put the tripod on the foil for safety.<br>
 Attach the balloon full of water so that the bottom of the balloon will just touch the candle flame.<br>
 A balloon filled with water will not pop like a similar balloon filled with air.<br>
 2. Fill a children's balloon with water, suspend a thermometer in the balloon and suspend the balloon over a burner.<br>
 Observer the increased temperature of the water without damage to the balloon.<br>
 3. Put 120 mL of water in a rubber balloon and tie the inlet.<br>
 Suspend the balloon over a lighted candle, but do not let the rubber touch the hot wick.<br>
 The balloon will explode after a few minutes.<br>
 Inflate another balloon with air and suspend it over a lighted candle.<br>
 This balloon explodes almost immediately.<br>
 Water at has a higher specific heat capacity, about 4.2 J.g-1 K-1, than air, slightly above 1.0 J.g-1 K-1, so it can absorb more
 heat than air for any degree rise in temperature.<br>
 <br>
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="23.7.2H">23.7.2</a> Water is a poor conductor of heat, boil water in a paper cup<br>
 1. Use your bare fingers to hold the bottom of a test-tube containing water.<br>
 Tilt the test-tube over a flame so that you can heat the water in the upper part of the test-tube.<br>
 You can hold the bottom of the test-tube until the water in the upper part boils, because water is a poor conductor of heat.<br>
 2. Boil water in a paper cup.<br>
 Pour water in a paper cup and hold it over a flame.<br>
 The paper will not catch fire, because the water keeps the temperature of the paper cup lower than its ignition point.<br>
 3. Put small pieces of ice in the bottom of a test-tube containing water.<br>
 Heat the water near the top of the test-tube with a spirit burner.<br>
 The water will start to boil, yet the ice will not melt.<br>
 The warmed water is already at the top, so no convection takes places, and the conduction by water is very small.<br>
 Little heat transfers to the ice.<br>
 4. Put a small fish in a test-tube full of water.<br>
 Tilt the test-tube and heat the top 1 cm of water.<br>
 The water will boil and not harm the fish.<br>
 However, this experiment upsets some students.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="23.7.4H"></a>23.7.4 Water is a poor conductor of heat<br>
 Water is a poor conductor of heat, boil water in a paper cup, heat water in a paper bag<br>
 1. Boil water in a paper cup.<br>
 Pour some water in a paper cup and hold it over a flame.<br>
 The water boils without burning the paper cup.<br>
 As a control, heat a paper cup not containing water or use a propane torch to burn away the top part of the cup above the water level.<br>
 2. Boil water in a paper pan.<br>
 Draw two concentric squares on copy paper with sides 13 cm and 18 cm.<br>
 Cut out the outer square and fold along the edges of the 13 cm square to make right angle corners.<br>
 Staple the flap at each corner.<br>
 Heat a sheet of metal gauze over a stove or Bunsen burner on a tripod until the metal gauze is red hot.<br>
 Fill the paper pan one third full of water.<br>
 Lift each end of the paper pan and place it on the hot metal gauze.<br>
 Observe steam coming from the surface of the water before it boils.<br>
 Some teacher add a raw egg to the water in the pan.<br>
 Water absorbs the heat without the temperature being high enough to scorch the paper, because of its high heat capacity.<br>
 Also, when the water turns to steam latent heat of vaporization is absorbed by the water.<br>
 3. Pour some water in a paper bag.<br>
 Agitate the paper bag to coat the inside with water, then pour out the excess water.<br>
 Put a small soft chocolate, e.g. "Chocolate Kiss", in the paper bag.<br>
 Heat the paper bag over a 100 W light globe.<br>
 The chocolate melts, but the paper bag does not get hot.<br>
 The chocolate was melted by the radiant heat from the light globe.<br>
 4. Boil water in a paper cup.<br>
 Use several disposable paper cups or make a square paper cup as in the diagram.<br>
 Heat a paper cup with a spirit burner and the paper cup burns out instantly.<br>
 Put two metallic rods over an iron heating stand.<br>
 Put a paper cup containing water on the two metallic rods and heat with the spirit burner.<br>
 The water boils without the cup catching on fire.<br>
 You can try the experiment with a plastic cup, but different plastics have different melting temperatures.<br>
<br>
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="23.7.5H">23.7.5</a> Boil water in aluminium pot and stainless steel pot<br>
 Use similar sizes of aluminium pot and a stainless steel pot.<br>
 Add the same volume of water.<br>
 Heat the two pots simultaneously.<br>
 Note the time to boiling in each pot.<br>
 As stainless steel is a good conductor of heat, the temperature in the part of bottom and wall of pot not touching the flame
 is almost the same as the part that is directly heated.<br>
 This allows convection of heated water to occur in many small regions, so you can see steam bubbles in the whole surface of water, evenly distributed and similar in size.<br>
 In the aluminium pot, you see only a raised boiling liquid column in the centre of an area on the surface of water just above to the bottom of pot heated by flame.<br>
 In the aluminium pot, the small bottom of pot heated absorbs the heat of vaporization mainly and convection currents starting from this small area extend to all the liquid in the pot.<br>
 Before the violent boiling appears, the original vaporization happens in a circle that the surface touches with the wall of the stainless steel,
 so you can see many small steam bubbles.<br>
 This is because in such place the temperature is higher and the pressure inside the liquid is less.<br>

<a href="../images/23.1.7.gif">See diagram 23.1.7</a>: Coin on paper.<br>
 Hold a piece of paper above a candle flame: it will char if brought near.<br>
 Put a metal coin or a key on the paper and hold it over the candle flame.<br>
 The metal conducts the heat away from the paper and leaves a pattern where the metal touches the paper.<br>

 Feel heat energy
 1. Use an iron rod, copper rod and glass rod that are the same length and diameter.<br>
 Hold one end of each rod with the other end over a Bunsen burner flame.<br>
 2. Repeat the experiment with rods of different diameters.<br>
 The bar that feels hot first shows the fastest rate of heat conduction.<br>
 3. Hold a wire coat hanger horizontally over a flame with your fingers, a small distance from directly above the flame.<br>
 Soon the wire becomes too hot to hold.<br>
 Move your fingers back, but keep the coat hanger in the same position.<br>
 Feel heat moving along the wire.<br>
<br>
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="23.7.8H">23.7.8</a> Conduction of heat by metal bars, melt paraffin wax<br>
 <a href="../images/23.7.2.gif">See diagram 23.7.2</a>: Paraffin wax blobs on wire.<br>
 1. Use a bar of copper, brass or aluminium at least 30 cm long.<br>
 Place blobs of melted paraffin wax at 3 cm intervals.<br>
 While the paraffin blobs are still soft, push the pointed ends of nails or tacks into them.<br>
 Heat one end of the box with a flame.<br>
 Note the evidence that heat moves along the bar by conduction.<br>
 2. Use lengths of metal bars with the same lengths and diameters.<br>
 The metals should have big differences in heat conduction coefficient, e.g. lead, iron, aluminium and copper.<br>
 Remove the bottom of a metal can and cut out three legs.<br>
 Punch several holes in the wall of the can and insert the metal bars so that they are all in contact at the centre of the can.<br>
 Attach pins to the ends of the metal bars with paraffin wax.<br>
 Place a spirit burner below the apparatus to heat the bars evenly.<br>
 Observe the dropping of the pins.<br>
 3. Show the rates of heat conduction in different metals.<br>
 Clamp four different metals in the disc of the conductometer.<br>
 Place a small chip of paraffin on each free end of the metals.<br>
 Heat the conductivity disc and observe the paraffin chips melting and falling off in the order of decreasing conductivity of the metals.<br>
 4. The apparatus consists of four metal strips, aluminium, brass, copper and steel that meet together at a central point.<br>
 Place a small piece of paraffin wax in a depression in the outer end of each metal strip.<br>
 Direct a Bunsen burner flame at the junction of the metal strips and note the order of melting, which shows the relative thermal conductivity of the metals.<br>
 5. Prepare metal wires with the same diameter, e.g.copper, iron and aluminium.<br>
 Cut the wires the same length and twist them together, but keep one end open.<br>
 Put the open end of the wires into melted wax liquid, and take out to let the wax harden and form a wax drop at the end of the wires.<br>
 Heat the other end of the wires over a Bunsen burner.<br>
 Rotate the wires as you heat to heat each wire evenly.<br>
 Note which wax drop at the end of a wire melts first.<br>
 6. Use identical lengths of different metal bars, e.g. copper, brass, aluminium.<br>
 Try to use rods of the same diameter.<br>
 Put blobs of melted candle wax at intervals along the bars.<br>
 Push small nails or metal pieces into the wax while the wax blobs are still soft.<br>
 Heat one end of the bars.<br>
 The blobs of wax melt and the nails fall down as heat moves along the bars.<br>
 The metals do not conduct heat equally.<br>
 7. Waxed balls drop off different metal rods connected to a heat source as the heat is conducted along the metal rods.<br>
 Dip metal rods in wax then watch as the wax melts off.<br>
 8. Four rods, steel, brass, aluminium, copper, with liquid crystal thermometers are placed in hot water to show different conduction rates.<br>

<hr width="800" size="2"><a name="23.7.9H">23.7.9</a> Conduction of heat by metals, Davy lamp<br>
 <a href="../images/23.119.gif">See diagram 23.119</a>: Davy lamp<br>
 1. Davy lamp<br>
 Hold a sieve or a piece of metal gauze, e.g. 1 mm iron gauze or metal fly-wire screen, over the flame of a small candle. (Not  fibreglass or plastic
 fly-wire screen!)<br>
 As you lower the wire gauze on the flame, the flame becomes smaller because the wire conducts the heat away from the flame so the temperature of the
 flame is lowered.<br> 
 Also, as you lower the wire gauze on the flame, the flame does not go through the wire netting because heat is conducted away from the flame by the wires.<br> 
 Sir Humphry Davy in 1816 used this observation to invent the miners' safety lamp that has metal gauze around the flame in the lamp to conduct away the heat
 so that the flame is not hot enough to ignite explosive gas in the coal mine.<br>
 2. Put a spirit burner under a tripod stand and cover the stand with 1 mm iron gauze.<br>
 Turn on the gas and ignite it above the metal gauze.<br>
 The gas burns only above the wire gauze screen, because the wire gauze conducts away the heat and prevents the gas below the gauze from reaching
 ignition temperature.<br>
 3. Every substance has own ignition temperature, i.e. the temperature to which you must heat it before it will burn in air.<br>
 Hold wire netting or a wire sieve above a lighted candle.<br> 
 Move the wire netting downwards and observe any change of the candlelight.<br> 
 The candle flame becomes dim because wire netting transfers the heat energy from the candle.<br>
 The candle flame not only becomes small but also is hindered crossing through the wire netting.<br>
 4. Be careful not to turn on the gas for too long time!<br>
 Place a Bunsen burner under a tripod covered with wire netting.<br> 
 Turn on the gas then try to light the gas above and below the wire netting with a lighted match.<br>
 Only the gas above the wire netting can be lit because conduction of heat energy makes the gas under the wire netting unable to reach ignition temperature.<br> 
 In a model Davy lamp, a candle enclosed in a cylinder of wire gauze does not light a jet of gas played on it from a rubber tube.<br> 
 Use a block of wood or Plasticine (modelling clay) as a base.<br>
 Be Careful!<br>
 Do not leave the gas jet turned on for extended periods.<br>
 Disperse the released gas by ventilating the room.<br>
 Remember to turn off the gas!<br>
 5. Place a candle on a board and light the candle.<br> 
 Place wire netting in the shape of a column above the candle.<br> 
 Prepare a rubber tube to lead to a combustible gas.<br>
 Place the nozzle of the gas on top of the wire netting then turn on the gas so that the gas flows on the top of the wire netting.<br>
 The gas does not burn because the high conductivity of metal makes the temperature outside the wire netting not reach the ignition temperature of the gas.<br>
 6. A Bunsen burner will burn on top and bottom of two copper screens a few cm apart.<br>
 A Bunsen burner flame will not strike through to the other side of fine copper wire gauze.<br>
 7. Heat platinum wire in a flask until it glows dull red then evacuate the flask and the wire will glow more brightly at the same voltage.<br>
 8. Use your fingers hold a wire coat hanger horizontally over a flame a small distance from directly above the flame.<br>
 Soon the wirebecomes too hot to hold.<br>
 Move your fingers back but keep the coat hanger in the same position.<br>
 Feel heat moving along the wire.<br>
 9. Use identical lengths of different metal bars or rods with the same diameter, e.g. copper, brass, aluminium, iron.<br>
 Put blobs of melted candle wax at the same intervals along the bars.<br>
 Push small nails or metal pieces into the wax while the wax blobs are still soft.<br>
 Heat one end of each metal bar.<br>
 The blobs of wax melt and the nails fall down as heat moves along the bar.<br> 
 The metals do not conduct heat equally.<br>
 10. Hold a piece of paper above a candle flame.<br> 
 The paper chars.<br>

 Cooking food keeps the temperature of the surface of the cooking vessel to the temperature of boiling water, 100 oC.<br>
 Use a small camping gas stove, an A4 sized piece of clean white paper, a little cooking oil, an old metal coat hanger, a few large paper clips,
 a metal spatula and an egg.<br>
 Make a square paper frying pan from a wire coat hanger with a paper dish fixed with paper clips.<br>
 Put drops of cooking oil on the paper to prevent the egg sticking to it.<br>
 Break an egg into the paper frying pan then hold it above a burner so that the paper above the flame is covered by egg.<br>
 The egg white and yolk contain water that turn into steam at 100 oC that remains at that temperature.<br>
 The paper may char around the edges of the egg.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="23.7.13H">23.7.13</a> Copper coil candle snuffer<br>
 <a href="../images/23.7.6.gif">See diagram 23.7.6</a>: Copper coil candle snuffer.<br>
 Ignition temperature of a gas is the temperature at which total heat lost from conduction, convection and radiation is less than the heat produced
 by the combustion of the gas.<br>
 To show that metal is a good heat conductor of heat energy and that a certain temperature is a necessary conditions for burning, make a screw coil
 by rolling with thick copper wire or brass netting.<br>
 1. Light a small candle.<br>
 Hold the coil high above the candle flame and slowly move it down towards the flame.<br>
 Observe the change in candle light.<br>
The candle light will reduce gradually then go out not, because of absence of oxygen, but because the wire transfers away the heat energy around
 the candle quickly the temperature around the candle is lower than the ignition temperature.<br>
 If the candle flame is too big, it may produce enough heat energy to compensate for the heat energy transferred by the wires so that the flame will not go out.<br>
 Note that the flame will not go out if you heat wire netting to a higher temperature so that its ability to transfer heat energy is lower.<br>
 2. Place a coil of heavy copper or aluminium wire over the flame of a candle.<br>
 The flame goes out.<br>
 You can snuff out a candle flame by depriving it of oxygen, but here the oxygen can easily get to the flame.<br>
 The fire goes out, because the coil of heavy wire conducts the heat away from the flame so fast that the temperature is lowered below the ignition
 temperature.<br>
 This shows that copper and aluminium are good conductors of heat.<br>

 Place a coil of heavy copper or aluminium wire over the flame of a small size candle.<br>
 Why does the flame go out?<br> 
 You can snuff out a candle flame by depriving it of oxygen, but here the oxygen can easily get to the flame.<br>
 The fire goes out, because the wire conducts the heat away from the flame so fast that the temperature is lowered below the kindling point.<br>
 This shows that copper and aluminium are good conductors of heat.<br>
 If the flame is too large, it will produce heat energy too rapidly to be carried away by the coil.<br>
 If the coil is already hot before the experiment, the temperature of the flame may not be lowered enough to put it out.<br>

 Some of the work done by the hitter is turned into heat energy, parts going to the wood and part to the iron.<br>
 The wood is a bad conductor of heat so that most of the heat is localized in the top of the peg, so the temperature of the peg rises.<br>

 Find out which of the materials is the best insulator and probably help you when you are in state of emergency such as pouring a  spoon of boiling porridge into your dinner pail made from stainless

 The simplest method of doing so is to feel a heated thing insulated by these materials.<br>
 However, distinguishing the degree of their heat insulation in detail is difficult. <br>
 The following way could distinguish their heat insulation in detail and tell you the difference between their insulation.<br>
 To do this, set up four big beakers and four small beakers, as shown.<br>
 Pour the same amount of hot water into each small beaker, then put  each small beaker containing hot water into each big one.<br>
 Select three kinds of heat insulators such as pieces of polyester plastics, pieces of papers and pieces of wood.<br>

 1. Place a coin on piece of paper and hold it high above a burning candle.<br>
 Lower the paper and coin towards the candle flame.<br>
 The paper in contact with the coin will not be burnt, because the metal in the coin conducts away the heat.<br>
 The paper not in contact with the coin will be burnt and leave a shape of the coin formed by the trace of burning.<br> 
 Stretch the paper level to contact keep good contact between paper and coin.<br>
 Repeat the experiment with the same paper with no coin on it.<br>
 All the paper will be burnt.<br>
 2. Wrap soft thread around a long screw.<br>
 Leave a small length of thread hanging down.<br>
 Set light to the end of the thread hanging down.<br>
The flame goes out at the place of contact with the screw, because metal in the screw conducts away heat so the thread cannot
 reach the temperature needed for burning (ignition temperature).<br>
 Repeat the experiment with a piece of wood roughly in the shape of the screw.<br>
The thread burns completely, because wood cannot conduct heat away from the place of burning.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="23.7.19H">23.7.19</a> Melt ice blocks<br>
 Place blocks of ice as follows:<br>
 * in the sun and sheltered from the wind,<br>
 * in the sun and in the wind,<br>
 * sheltered from the sun and wind,<br>
 * in an ice chest or insulated portable cooler, e.g. "Esky".<br>
 List the blocks of ice in order of complete melting.<br>
 The ice will melt most rapidly in (2), then (1), then (3), then (4).<br>
 See below:<br>
 (1) The ice absorbs most heat directly from the sun by radiation and lesser heat from its surroundings by conduction and radiation,
 but mainly by convection currents in the air.<br>
 Some of the ice has melts to form a layer of water over the ice.<br>
 Water is a bad conductor of heat so the ice will melt more slowly if the layer of water remains.<br>
 When the air is still, a layer of cold air forms round the ice and reduces the amount of heat received from the air by convection.<br>
 (2) The layer of water over the ice evaporates more freely than in (a) so that the ice is dried and so melts more quickly.<br>
 Unlike (1), new air is continually coming into contact with the ice so the amount of heat received by convection is not reduced.<br>
 (3) No heat is received by radiation from the sun or by wind convection.<br>
 Some heat is received by conduction and radiation from the shaded surroundings and some very small convection currents.<br>
 (4) No loss of heat by convection except from within the container.<br>
 When the temperature of the interior of the container falls below the room temperature it receives heat from the surroundings by convection, conduction
 and radiation at a rate depending on the temperature difference.<br>
 The temperature of the container falls until the heat received by the container equals the heat used in melting the ice.<br>
 The temperature difference for the container and air is less than for the ice and air, and the container is made of a bad conductor of heat, 
so melting in (4) is the slowest.<br <br>

 An object made of iron may feel colder than an object made of wood at the same temperature even if both objects have been in the sunlight and the iron
 object appears hotter.<br>
 Iron is a good conductor of heat, so when the finger touches the iron, heat is transferred from the body to the iron, and is distributed over the whole of
 the piece of iron, so there is only a very slight rise in the temperature of the iron, and it seems cold.<br>
 Wood is a bad conductor of heat so when it is touched heat is transferred from the body to the wood, but the heat is concentrated in the touched region.<br>
 The temperature in that touched region rises and the wood appears comparatively warm.<br>
 However, heat has not spread throughout the bad conduction object made of wood so the other fingers may feel the wood to be cooler than the iron.<br>
 If the iron and wood are placed in the sun so that the same amount of radiant energy falls on both of them, the iron may become hotter than the wood,
 because the specific heat of the iron is much less than that of the wood so it is a better absorber of heat.<br>

 <a href="../images/23.2.8.gif">See diagram 23.2.8</a>: Smoke moves up and down.<br>
 Convection is movement of heat energy through a liquid or gas that involves the flow of the medium itself.<br>
 Convection is caused by the expansion of the medium as its temperature rises, the expanded material being less dense, and rises above colder and denser
 material.<br>
 * Smoke from a fire rises, because the air above the fire is heated, expands, and therefore becomes lighter than the surrounding air, and hence is pushed up,
 carrying with it the particles of carbon, which constitute the smoke.<br>
 * Ice wrapped in a blanket melts slowly, because the blanket is a bad conductor of heat so little heat is conducted to the ice from the surroundings.<br>
 Also, the blanket prevents the outside air from coming into contact with the ice so little heat is conveyed to the ice by convection.<br>

 1. To make a convection box, cut away one side of a box and replace it with glass.<br>
 Cut two holes 2 cm diameter and 10 cm apart in the top of the box.<br>
 Attach two tubes above the holes to be chimneys.<br>
 Put a candle in the box under one chimney.<br>
 Light the candle.<br>
 Hold the smoking paper above each chimney.<br>
 See the convection currents through the glass side of the box.<br>
 2. Another way of showing air currents is by making use of the difference in refractive indexes of warm and cold air.<br>
 A car headlight bulb without a reflector will cast shadows of convection current from an electric heater.<br>
 Look at an object on the other side of a hot engine or a hot road.<br>
 The object will appear distorted, because the refractive indexes of warm and cold air are different.<br>
 This is one cause of mirages in the desert.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="23.8.2H">23.8.2</a> Convection cells<br>
1. Cumulus cloud<br>
 Damp ground heated by the sun warms the air above it that expands, becomes less dense and rises as a thermal, carrying water vapour with it to form
 cumulus cloud.<br>
 The photosphere (shining surface), of the Sun consists of regions of hot larva that rise to the surface, cool, and drop back into the interior again.<br>
 2. Hadley cells, (George Hadley, 1685-1768, England)
 Hadley cells in the atmosphere occur at low latitudes where air warms and rises near the equator and descend towards the poles at about 30 degrees latitude.<br>
 They cause the tropical trade winds in the tropics and control low-latitude weather patterns.<br>
 They are single wind systems in each hemisphere.<br>
 They flow towards the West and the equator near the surface, and flow towards the East and North or South poles at higher altitudes.<br>
 3. Water and oil<br>
 Put water coloured with a vegetable dye in a tall beaker.<br>
 Add vegetable oil and baby oil.<br>
 Put the beaker on a low heat source.<br>
 Note the time taken by globs of oil to reach the surface and return to the bottom of the beaker.<br>
 Not the time taken again after increasing the heat from the heat source.<br>
 4. Boiler<br>
 Heat water in a large boiler heated by a ring of gas jets.<br>
 Note the convection cells in the water above the gas jets.<br>
 5. Lava lamps<br>
 A lava lamp contains coloured water, phenylamine or oil or wax slightly less dense than water and an incandescent light bulb surrounded by the oil
 at the bottom.<br>
 When the switch is turned on, the incandescent lamp becomes hot, heats the oil at the bottom and it becomes less dense and rises through the coloured
 water.<br>
 Near the top of the lamp, the rising oil cools, becomes more dense and sinks down towards the incandescent bulb.<br>
 So what you see is a convection current of oil in water.<br>

 Bore four holes in each end.<br>
 Each end represents a window.<br>
 The top holes of each side are the top halves of each window.<br>
 Put four candles in the box, light them and close the sliding glass.<br>
 To study the best conditions for ventilation, put solid corks in the openings, close completely both windows, and note the candles.<br>
 Try the following different combinations of opening:<br>
 * One window open at the top and bottom, i.e. all four holes in one side open,<br>
 * One window open at the top and the other at the bottom,<br>
 * Both windows open at the top, one window open at the bottom,<br>
 * Both windows open at the bottom, one window open at the top.<br>
 Find which window openings provide the best ventilation.<br>
 2. To study the expansion of freezing water, use two identical drinking cups.<br>
 Fill the first cup with tap water at room temperature so that the water heaps up to form a meniscus.<br>
 Put the second cup in the freezing compartment of the refrigerator then add extra water to the cup to get the highest possible meniscus.<br>
 When the water in the cup is frozen, compare the meniscus of the frozen water with the meniscus at room temperature.<br>
 The frozen water heaped up, because it had expanded.<br>
 Water has a maximum density at 4 oC.<br>
 When water cools from room temperature to 4 oC, it contracts in volume.<br>
 When water cools from 4 oC to 0 oC, it expands in volume.<br>
 At 4 oC the density of water is 1000 kg m-3 (1 g per cc).<br>
 At 0 oC the density of water is 999.87 kg m-3 and the density of ice is 918 kg m-3, so ice floats on water.<br>
 3. Fill a large jar with cold water and weigh it accurately on a balance.<br>
 Empty the jar.<br>
 Fill the jar with exactly the same volume of hot water and weigh.<br>
 You will observe that the jar of warm water weighs less.<br>
Volume for volume, cold water is heavier than warm water; so when water is heated convection current are set up, the warm water being lifted,
 because of buoyancy, by the cold surrounding water.<br>
 Hot water is less dense than cold water, and this is the cause of convection current in a liquid.<br>

<a href="../images/3.2.0.1ch.gif">See diagram 3.2.0.1</a>: Alcohol lamp, spirit burner.<br>
 1. Use a small jar with a screw-on metal lid.<br>
 Invert the metal lid on a block of wood and use a large nail to punch a hole in the centre.<br>
 Note that when you replace the lid on the jar, the projecting metal around the hole will point upward.<br>
 Make a wick by tearing away a strip from old cloth.<br>
 Use a pencil to push the end of the wick through the hole in the lid, starting from the smooth side of the hole.<br>
 Half fill the jar with methylated spirits.<br>
 Screw the lid tightly on the jar and light the wick.<br>
 The metal lid will conduct heat away from the flame so that the flame does not go below the lid into the methylated spirits.<br>
 2. Use a small bottle with a screw metal cap as a simple spirit burner, (an alcohol lamp).<br>
 Punch a hole in the centre of the metal cap.<br>
 Enlarge the hole so that a metal tube 4 cm long fits into the hole.<br>
 Push the tube 1 cm into the bottle.<br>
 Make a wick from cotton waste or a cotton bath towel.<br>
 Put the wick in the bottle and pull it up through the tube.<br>
 Fill the bottle with methylated spirit.<br>
 Make a simple tripod stand with tin snips to cut away the sides of a tin can.<br>
 The wick should protrude about 3 cm from the cap and fit tightly into the wick holder.<br>
 The wick holder should fit tightly into the burner.<br>
 Use only methylated spirit or absolute alcohol (ethanol), as the fuel in the spirit burner.<br>
 3. Place the spirit burner on a metal tray or where it cannot be knocked over, i.e. not within "elbow radius" of the user.<br>
 Keep the container of methylated spirit stored in another room.<br>
 To fill the spirit burner, remove the screw cap containing the wick and use a filter funnel to three quarters fill the glass reservoir.<br>
 Replace the screw cap, screw it down tightly, and wipe the spirit burner dry of methylated spirit.<br>
 Wash the filter funnel.<br>
 4. To extinguish the flame, place a dry test-tube over it so that the rim of the test-tube touches the cap of the spirit burner, or use the glass / ceramic cap.<br>
 The spirit burner flame is almost invisible so be sure that the flame is really extinguished before handling or moving the spirit burner.<br>
 5. Students should not be allowed to lift the spirit burner or remove it from the bench.<br>
 However, they may move the spirit burner by sliding to move it to a safer or more convenient position.<br>
 6. Make an alcohol lamp, spirit lamp, from an ink bottle.<br>
 Use an ink bottle with a screw-on metallic cap, a metallic sheet of 2.5 cm × 4 cm, alcohol, and a wick made up of wasted cotton or cotton bath
 towel of length twice the height of the ink bottle.<br>
 Drill a hole with a nail in the centre of the cap of the bottle.<br>
 Use a file to enlarge the hole to diameter 10 mm and use a hard round object, e.g. a round file, to burnish the hole.<br>
 Roll the small metallic sheet into a cylinder.<br>
 The outer diameter of the cylinder is equal to the inner diameter of the hole on the cap of the bottle.<br>
 Push the cylinder about 1 cm into the hole on the cap.<br>
 If possible, solder the cylinder on the cap, and solder the cracks between the cylinder and the cap.<br>
 Insert the wick into the cylinder on the cap and leave a part of itslength outside of the cap and trim that part.<br>
 Fill fuel into the bottle, but not full.<br>
 Screw the cap on the bottle tightly to prevent evaporation.<br>

 Remove their caps and clean them then dry them.<br>
 Paint their insides with white lacquer and outsides with black lacquer and white quicklime solution uniformly.<br>
 Choosing bright lacquers to paint them is better and do not paint the second layer of lacquer until the first one is fully dry.<br>
 Use a piece of white foam board for packing instruments.<br>
 Make three caps and pads for the three cans with the board.<br>
 Insert a thermometer into each cap.<br>
 Fill the 3 tin cans with the same volume of cold water.<br>
 Cover the cap on each can and put the pad under each can.<br>
 Place each can with the cap and the pad in the sunlight far from each another.<br>
 Record the original temperatures.<br>
 Then record their temperatures every 5 to 15 minutes.<br>
 Draw a temperature time curve with the 5 groups of data recorded.<br>

 The second can cools fastest, because a black surface is the best radiator of heat.<br>
 3. Use a metal with width greater than a 100 W incandescent light bulb.<br>
 Paint one half of the inside of the can black.<br>
 Leave the other half shiny.<br>
 Put two blobs of petroleum jelly on opposite sides of the outside of the can.<br>
 Put one opposite the middle of the black interior and the other opposite the middle of the shiny interior.<br>
 Stick two coins on the blobs of petroleum jelly.<br>
 Fix a 100 watt light globe over the middle of the can and turn on the light.<br>
 The coin nearest the black interior falls first, because its blob of petroleum jelly melts first.<br>

 5. Wear a dark coloured sleeve and a light coloured sleeve of the same weave.<br>
Your arm in the dark-coloured sleeve feels warmer.<br>
 If one sleeve is made of loosely woven material. it has many air spaces compared with a tightly woven material. and air is a heat insulator.<br>
<a href="../images/Bichsel.jpg">See diagram</a>: Bichsel boxes.<br>
A "black body" is a hypothetical perfect absorber and radiator of electromagnetic radiation.<br>
Holes in black boxes are blacker than the boxes themselves, even though one box is painted white on the inside.<br>
A box with a black interior and another box with a white interior show that the radiation coming from a cavity is determined by the temperature inside the cavity.<br>
The two holes appear equally dark. although the inside of one box is painted white and the other is painted black.<br>
So the radiation emerging from the holes is a function only of temperature.<br>
Bichsel boxes demonstrates Wien's law of radiation:<br>
The density energy of radiation Uv. which corresponds to the frequency of radiation v. depends on v and the absolute temperature T.<br>
Bichsel boxes<br>
1. A light tight box has two small identical holes in one face.<br>
One of the holes is backed by a black piece of paper.<br>
The other hole has no backing and appears much darker.<br>
Open the box to show that the inside is painted white.<br>
An ideal black surface absorbs. rather than reflects. all radiation that hits it.<br>
If the hole in the box is small enough. most radiation that hits the hole enters the box. bounces around the box. most getting absorbed on each bounce, and never leaves the box through the hole.<br>
So the hole is perfectly black.<br>
The small hole also emits radiation. with a spectral distribution of frequencies that depends only on the temperature of the walls of the box.<br>
The description of this radiation led directly to the discovery of quantum theory.<br>
2. Two identical boxes are painted black on the outside, can be opened or closed, and have an identical small hole in the middle of the wall.<br>
One box is painted black inside and the other box is painted white inside.<br>
For both boxes, the holes appear blacker than the outside wall of the boxes.<br>
This observation demonstrates that the radiation coming from a cavity is determined by the temperature inside the cavity.<br>
 3. A light tight oven with a tiny hole in the side. emits "cavity radiation" through the hole.<br>

Put a thermometer in each tea pot and compare the loss of heat due to radiation.<br>
 Stefan-Boltzmann law. Wien's law. KircHoff's law<br>
The Stefan-Boltzmann law states that the total energy radiated from a black body is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature of the body.<br>
 (Joseph Stefan 1835 - 1893. Ludwig Boltzmann 1844 -1906)<br>
 Heat can be transferred by wave motion. even across a vacuum.<br>
 This is called radiation.<br>
 Heat travels by radiation almost instantaneously.<br>
A "black body" is an imaginary body that absorbs all the thermal radiation onto it and is a perfect emitter of thermal radiation as a continuous spectrum.<br>
So the radiation includes all the wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation.<br>
 The intensity of the radiation is greatest at a wavelength that depends only on the temperature of the body.<br>
Energy = σ × T<sup>4</sup>. ( σ (sigma) = 5.67 × 10<sup>-8</sup> Joules second<sup>-1</sup> metres Kelvin<sup>-4</sup>. and T = absolute temperature.<br>
 Total energy radiated = E × surface area × time.<br>
 A full radiator would absorb all the radiant energy falling on it.<br>
 Lampblack is close to being a full radiator.<br>
Wien's law (Wilhelm Wien. Germany 1864-1928) states the product of the absolute temperature of a body and the wave length of maximum radiation is a constant.<br>
 T × absolute temperature = constant.<br>
The wavelength at which the maximum energy is radiated from a source is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature of the source.<br>
 So as temperature rises. maximum radiation decreases.<br>
 Hotter objects emit most of their radiation at shorter wavelengths 
 and appear to be blue-white. white hot.<br>
 Cooler objects emit most of their radiation at longer wavelengths and appear red, because of infrared radiation, i.e. red hot.<br>
KircHoff's law of radiation (Gustav KircHoff 1824-1887) refers to the observation that black clothes are good absorbers of heat and good emitters of heat.<br>
However. on a hot day. the body wearing black clothes receives more heat than it can emit. so white clothes are preferred, because they are good reflectors of heat and poor absorbers of heat.<br>

 The heat could not have reached your hand so quickly by conduction, because air is a very poor conductor of heat.<br>
 The heat could not reach your hand by convection, because convection carries the heat upward and away from your hand.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="23.9.4H">23.9.4</a> Colour temperature<br>
Colour temperature is a measurement in degrees Kelvin that indicates the hue of a light source.<br>
The colour temperature of a light source is the temperature of an ideal black body radiator that radiates light of comparable hue to the light source.<br>
Colour temperatures over 5,000 K are called cool colours (bluish white) and lower colour temperatures (2000 K) are called warm colours, (yellow-white to red).<br>
Within visible light, the shorter the wavelength the higher the colour temperature.<br>
The hottest stars radiate blue (cool) light, and the coolest radiate red (warm) light.<br>
 Approximate ranges of colour temperature:<br>
Infrared, candle 1800 K. tungsten incandescent bulb 2800 K. tungsten-halogen bulb (quartz bulb) 3200 K.<br>

 A thermopile is made of thermocouple junction pairs connected electrically in series.<br>
 The absorption of thermal radiation by one of the thermocouple junctions.<br> 
 called the active junction. increases its temperature.<br>
 Differential temperature between an active junction and a reference junction at fixed temperature produces an emf proportional to the differential
 temperature.<br> 
 This effect is called a thermoelectric effect.<br>
 For more sensitivity. thermocouples are joined in series to make a thermopile.<br>
 Thermopiles do not respond to absolute temperature., but generate an output voltage proportional to a local temperature difference or temperature gradient.<br>
 A thermopile consists of four iron and four copper wires twisted to form seven junctions to produce a thermoelectric emf.<br>
 The end terminals connect to a galvanometer.<br>
 Use a hand held hair drier is a suitable source of heat to activate the thermopile.<br>

<a href="../images/23.116.gif">See diagram 23.116</a>: Simple thermoscope<br>
Practise with different materials before doing this experiment, because for most cloths the absorption of infrared is almost independent of colour.<br>
 The amount of surface area pointing towards the source is also a variable.<br>
 Use two identical clear plastic bottles.<br>
 Put a dark coloured piece of cloth or plastic in one bottle.<br>
 Put an identical amount of white cloth or shiny metal foil in the other bottle.<br>
 Fit the bottles with one-hole stoppers with 20 cm of glass tubing.<br>
 Into each glass tube introduce a bead of water or oil.<br>
 Place each bottle in the sun. or about 50 cm from a bright light bulb or 1 metre from a fire or 20 cm from a burning lamp or candle.<br>
 Note the rate at which the beads of water or oil rise in the tubes.<br>
 1. Paint two thermoscopes. one thermoscope white the other black and illuminate both by a lamp.<br>
 2. Two thermoscopes have a black surface and a white surface.<br>
 The pressure inside the thermoscopes is less than atmospheric pressure and is equalized by the connecting tubes and valve A.<br>
 Close valve A so that the two thermoscopes are independent.<br>
Shine a 150 W spotlight on the thermoscopes and observe the difference in fluid height showing a difference in pressure between the two thermoscope
 tubes caused by different temperatures.<br>
 So the black surface has absorbed more heat than the white surface.<br>
 3. Use flasks. or cut off light bulbs.<br>
 Fit both flasks or bulbs with corks and tubes about 15 cm in length.<br>
 Make holes 22 cm apart in a base board.<br>
 Pass the lower ends of the tubes through flat corks. glue the tubes in a vertical position and connect the open ends by rubber tubing.<br>
 Remove one bulb and blacken the other bulb in a candle flame.<br>
 Pour liquid into the U-tube so formed until the level is about 7 cm above the baseboard.<br>
 Replace the clear bulb and slide the tube in or out so that the liquid remains level.<br>
 Place a candle equidistant between the bulbs and note the levels of the liquid in the U-tube.<br>
 4. Experiment with different materials before doing this experiment, because for most cloths the absorption of infrared is almost independent of colour.<br>
 The amount of surface area pointing towards the source is also a variable.<br>
 Use two identical clear plastic bottles.<br>
 Put a dark coloured piece of cloth or plastic in one bottle.<br>
 Put an identical amount of white cloth or shiny metal foil in the other bottle.<br>
 Fit the bottles with one-hole stoppers with 20 cm of glass tubing.<br>
 Into each glass tube introduce a bead of water or oil.<br>
 Place each bottle in the sun. or about 50 cm from a bright light bulb or 1 metre from a fire or 20 cm from a burning lamp or candle.<br>
 Observe the rate at which the beads of water or oil rise up the tubes.<br>
 5. Show selective absorption of radiation using a thermoscope.<br>
 Place different screens between a heat source and a thermopile detector.<br>
 Focus a large light on a blackened match head the clear glass bulb of a thermoscope and the bulb covered with black paper.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="23.9.23H">23.9.23</a> Transfer heat by radiation<br>
 Hold the palm of your hand very close to., but not touching. your cheek.<br>
 Feel the radiation from your hand.<br>
 Heat travels by radiation almost instantaneously.<br>
 Hold your hand under an unlighted electric light bulb. the palm upward.<br>
 Turn on the electricity and feel the heat from the light bulb.<br>
 The heat could not reach your hand so quickly by conduction, because air is a very poor conductor of heat.<br>
 The heat could not reach your hand by convection, because convection carries the heat upward and away from your hand.<br>
 The heat came to your hand carried by short electromagnetic waves of wavelengths longer than light.<br>
 Radiation carries heat in every direction from the source.<br>
 Put a piece of glass between a light bulb and your hand to block any movement of air.<br>
 Feel the radiated heat.<br>
