1. The electrical wiring in science laboratories, and other activity areas  should be adequately protected against overloading by circuit  breakers.<br>
 Repairs should be done only by a qualified electrician.<br>
2. Wiring should not be overloaded by using appliances, or equipment whose current rating is greater than that of the power outlet.<br>
 General purpose outlets (GPOs) were usually rated at 10 amps.<br>
 Some GPOs may be rated at 15 amps.<br>
3. The use of double adapters should be avoided.<br>
 Portable power boards (multiple point power boards), especially those with circuit breakers, should be used.<br>
4. All power leads must be in good condition, of the appropriate current  rating for the appliance(s) being used, and of the minimum  length necessary for use.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.4.0H":>4.4.0</a> Electrical outlets and equipment<br>
 Electrical outlets<br>
 1. Permanent general purpose electrical outlets must be in a safe and 
operational condition.<br>
 2. New installations must be fitted with automatic blind outlets.<br>
 For further information regarding electrical safety refer to Section Commercial 
 electrical equipment<br>
3. The Regulatory Unit of the Department of Minerals and Energy (DME), has set down guidelines for equipment operating on 240 volts.<br>
 4. Teachers are reminded that home-made 240V equipment would be unlikely to comply with legal specifications.<br>
 5. All 240V electrical equipment should be serviced and checked by a qualified electrician.<br>
  6. Equipment suppliers must supply schools with equipment that complies  with QEI specifications, appropriate earthing and  use of approved insulating materials.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.1.1H">4.1.1</a> Effects of electric current  passing through the human body<br>
 1. Breathing can stop<br>
 2. The heart can stop<br>
 3. Burns to the skin and internal organs<br>
 4. Muscle spasm<br>
 5. Clinical shock (a reaction of the body's nervous system to severe injury)<br>
 6. Falls may cause injuries<br>
 The danger to persons caused by an electric current passing through the human body depends upon the value of the current.<br>
 However, it is difficult to calculate what this current will be under any given set of circumstances.<br>
 The relationship of current to voltage is not linear, because body resistance  varies with the touch voltage and with the path taken by  the current.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.1.2H">4.1.2</a> "Let-go" current (sometimes  called the "cannot let-go" current)<br>
 This is defined as the maximum current a person can tolerate when holding  an electrode, and still let go of this electrode using muscles stimulated by this current.<br>
 Experimental evidence places the value of this current at about 10 milliamperes.<br>
 Higher currents would cause muscle freezing, preventing persons from releasing their hand from the conductor.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.1.3H">4.1.3</a> Causes of electric current  passing through the human body<br>
 An electric shock could be received from the following:<br>
 1. Wall or bench outlets (power points),<br>
 2. Switches,<br>
 3. Mains-operated equipment,<br>
 4. Leads connecting equipment to power points,<br>
 5. Extension leads.<br>
 In Queensland, the electricity reticulation system is MEN (Multiple Earth Neutral), i.e. the neutral wire is earthed at the powerhouse, at the point of<br>
 supply to each consumer and at other points along the line between powerhouse and consumer.<br>
 If a person comes into contact with a live conductor connected to the mains, e.g. the active pin in a power point or switch or an exposed active wire<br>
 in a lead, for a touch voltage of 240 volts AC, the body resistance between its extremities is of the order of 1000 ohms.<br>
 Under these conditions, the current flowing through the person would be 240 milliamperes, mA.<br>
 This current could produce serious results.<br>
 If the earth lead is faulty or broken, i.e. high resistance, the greater  part of the earth leakage current will flow through the person.<br>
 The fuse will not blow, because the current is insufficiently high and the effect on the person could be fatal.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.2.1H">4.2.1</a> Power points and switches<br>
 1. Dry hands thoroughly before operating any switch.<br>
 2. Do not allow the cover plates of power points or switches to be removed.<br>
 If, for any reason, the cover plate has been removed or damaged, do not  allow the point or switch to be used until it has been repaired by a qualified electrician.<br>
 3. Switches must be in the "off" position before inserting plugs or removing  plugs from power points.<br>
 4. Grasp the plug, not the lead, when removing plugs from power points.<br>
 Hold the plug firmly and pull away.<br>
 5. Do not allow students to tamper with power points or switches, e.g. by pushing metal objects into power points or poking at pilot lights with metal objects.<br>
 6. If a power point or switch is faulty in any way, do not attempt to repair it yourself.<br>
 Do not allow students to use it until it is repaired.<br>
 7. Cover power points with plug protectors when not in use.<br>
 8. Hand-held equipment (e.g. electric drills), unless double insulated,  must be operated through an isolating transformer or a core  balance earth leakage device.<br>
 These are designed to protect the operator from injury from faulty earth  connections.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.2.2H">4.2.2</a> Mains-operated equipment<br>
 Mains operated equipment has to meet the stringent requirements laid down by the Queensland Electricity Industry (QEI), e.g. that it be effectively  earthed,<br>
 (unless double insulated), and that the lead from the equipment to the power point be effectively anchored within the equipment, so that it cannot be pulled loose.<br>
1. If the equipment installed by the Department of Public Works and Housing fails to function, teachers should not attempt to repair it.<br>
 This is not only dangerous, but illegal.<br>
 Faults should be reported to the nearest depot of the Department of Public Works and Housing or the principal may arrange for a local electrician to effect repairs.<br>
 2. Avoid using 240 volt equipment near sinks or water outlets or close  to gas outlets where accidental sparking may ignite gas leaks.<br>
 3. Disconnect portable appliances from the power outlet when not in use.<br>
 4. Before attempting to clean any mains operated equipment (portable or fixed), ensure that it is switched off and disconnected from the  power point.<br>
 5. Hand held equipment, e.g. electric drills, unless double insulated, must be operated through an isolating transformer, or a core balance earth  leakage device.<br>
 These are designed to protect the operator from injury in the event of faulty earth connections.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.2.3H">4.2.3</a> Electrical leads<br>
 Most mains operated equipment is connected to power points through leads  that contain three wires.<br>
 They are colour coded as follows:<br>
 Table 4.2.3    
<table border="1" cols="3" width="50%">

 </tbody> 
</table>
 Both these standards are presently acceptable to the Queensland Electricity  Industry.<br>
The earth lead (green or green/yellow), is meant to earth the frame, or metal case of the equipment, to prevent shock to the user, should a short circuit<br>
 occur between the electrically "live" parts of the equipment and the frame or case.<br>
 The other two wires in the lead (red and black or brown and blue), carry 
 the electric current operating the equipment.<br>
 The following safe practices should be followed:<br>
 1. Inspect all leads and fittings regularly for frayed or cracked insulation.<br>
 If a lead is considered defective, it should be  checked by a qualified
 electrician.<br>
 2. Never use a lead if the plug that fits into the mains operated equipment, 
 or the three pin plug that fits into the power point are 
 damaged or loose.<br>
 3. Never twist or knot a lead or bend it sharply.<br>
 4. Never tack leads to walls.<br>
 5. Store leads when not in use in such a way that the insulation will 
not be damaged.<br>
 6. Avoid using extension leads, where possible.<br>
 If necessary, use commercially available leads.<br>
 Home-made leads must not be used.<br>
 7. Always switch off the equipment before attempting to disconnect extension 
 leads.<br>
 8. Use the shortest possible continuous lead.<br>
 9. Use a power board when several appliances need to be plugged in.<br>
 <b>Do NOT use double adapters!</b><br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.2.4H">4.2.4</a> Electrical inspections tests<br>
 Checks are usually arranged through the principal.<br>
All movable electrical equipment that has a lead fitted, or that requires a lead to be attached, and all extension leads, are to be checked at prescribed<br>
intervals and tagged by a qualified electrical worker, in accordance with Australian Standard AS 3760-1990 "In-service inspection and testing of<br>
electrical equipment".<br>
It should be noted that damage may be caused to specialized electronic equipment, e.g. as photocopiers, computers, typewriters and facsimile machines<br>
if they are not tested correctly.<br>
The following table outlines the testing requirements:<br>

Records are required for all items of electrical equipment, including the dates of each test, and the name and licence number of the qualified electrical<br>
worker, to be kept and to be made readily available to a Division of Accident Prevention inspector upon request.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.2.5H">4.2.5</a> Reporting an accident<br>
Any accident involving mains power should be reported to the local electrical authority, which will conduct an investigation and report to the QEI.<br>
 Such action may prevent further accidents from similar causes.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.2.8H">4.2.8</a> Core balance earth leakage 
 devices<br>
Core balance earth leakage devices work on the principle of current balance.<br>
In any electrical equipment, which are in good condition, the currents in the active and neutral conductors are equal and opposite.<br>
A current transformer placed around these two conductors will have no
secondary voltage induced or current flowing.<br>
If the equipment is earthed and the insulation resistance between equipment and the earth is low, some of the load current will flow to earth instead of<br>
returning through the neutral (earth leakage current).<br>
 Since only the active and neutral conductors pass through the current
transformer, the currents in these two conductors are no longer 
 balanced and do not cancel.<br>
 This out-of-balance earth leakage current induces a voltage in the secondary 
 of the current transformer, which is used to operate a relay 
 and trip a circuit breaker.<br>
If, for any reason, an earth leakage current flows through the operator, the imbalance between the currents in the active and neutral leads causes a current<br>
to flow in the circuit of the secondary of the current transformer, which operates a relay and a circuit breaker, thus switching off the mains.<br>
 Notice that the mains system is MEN (Multiple Earth Neutral) as stated 
previously.<br>
This protective system does not prevent current passing through the operator, but design considerations can keep this current low in value and flowing<br>
only for a limited time, i.e. until the circuit breaker operates.<br>
 Portable devices of this kind operate on an earth current of 20 milliamperes 
 and tripping times as low as 30 milliseconds.<br>
 The result of this combination of current and time is that the operator
 will be aware of the shock, but will experience no dangerous effects.<br>
 All these devices have re-set buttons that must be operated after the
circuit breaker has been tripped.<br>
 Test buttons are also provided to enable the operator to ascertain whether 
 the device is working according to the design specifications.<br>
 Most high schools have a device of this kind protecting the electric circuits 
 in the laboratories and demonstration rooms.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.2.9H">4.2.9</a> Precautions to take when 
 using core balance earth leakage devices<br>
 If the core balance earth leakage device trips during the operation of
 some equipment, a qualified electrician should be called to examine 
 the equipment before it is used again.<br>
 Operate the test button once a week to ensure that the device is operating 
 satisfactorily.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.2.10H">4.2.10</a> Management of electric 
 shock victims<br>
 The rescuer must:<br>
 1. Turn off the electricity supply if possible.<br>
 OR<br>
 1a. Disconnect the victim from the electricity supply by the use of a 
dry non-conducting material e.g. dry clothing, a wooden stick.<br>
 2. Avoid any direct contact with the skin of the patient or any conducting 
 material touching until disconnected.<br>
 3. Commence resuscitation.<br>
 Use cardiopulmonary resuscitation if the patient's heart has stopped beating.<br>
 4. Seek medical help. 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.2.11H">4.2.11</a> Australian voltage<br>
 In 1983, Standards Australia adopted a 20 year plan to convert Australia 
 from the nominal 240 volts to 230 volts, to align with 
 European Standards - IEC38.<br>
 The aim was to align Australian manufactured products with the main trading
 partners.<br>
