<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="28.88H"></a>28.88 Straight pulses in a ripple tank<br>
Ripple Tanks</a> (Commercial).<br>
Experiment<br>
 Make pulses by giving a cylindrical wooden rod a sharp push forward and back in the ripple tank.<br>
 This motion produces continuous waves.<br>
 The ripples are wider near the rod, but sharper as they move away.<br>
 The ripples are sharpest when the filament of the light bulb is parallel to them.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="28.91H"></a>28.91 Refraction of waves in a ripple tank<br>
Experiment<br>
Put a plate of glass in the middle of the ripple tank to create a sloping depth.<br>
Note the distance between crests (wavelength) as the depth becomes more shallow.<br>
The wavelength is less and the velocity of the wave is also lower in the shallow water than it is in the deep water.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="28.119H"></a>28.119 Focal length of a convex lens<br>
Focal length of a lens, 1 dioptre (UK), diopter (US) = 1 / focal length, in metres<br>
Experiment<br>
Attach a sheet of white paper on a wall opposite a bright window with the sun not visible, because it is behind an outside object, e.g. a tree.<br>
The light rays passing through the window from the distant sun will be almost parallel.<br>
Hold a convex lens vertically about 5 cm from the paper the move it in a straight line towards the window until a clear image of the window 
 appears on the white paper at a distance of the focal length of the lens.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="28.120H"></a>28.120 Light rays through lenses<br>
<a href="../images/28.120.gif">See diagram 28.120</a>: Ray diagrams for lenses.<br>
 Parallel rays of light that pass through a convex lens, converging lens, all pass through the principle focus, F.<br>
 Parallel rays of light that pass through a concave, diverging lens, diverge as if coming from the principle focus, F.<br>
 In the diagram, 1. to 4 are convex lenses that form real images when the object is more than one focal length from the lens.<br>
 Light rays come from a distant object,<br>
 The object is twice the focal length from the lens,<br>
 The object is between the focal length and twice the focal length from the lens,<br>
 The object is less than the focal length from the lens,<br>
 A concave always produces the same kind of image.<br>
Experiment<br>
Take the lenses from an old pair of spectacles or used optical instruments, 
 or purchase reading glass lenses and hand magnifiers.<br>
 Cover the window of a smoke box with a piece of black cardboard with 
 three holes punched in a vertical line.<br>
 The holes should be the same distance apart, but the distance between the two outside holes should be a little less than the diameter of the lens.<br>
 Arrange a torch supply parallel to light rays.<br>
 Fill the box with smoke and hold a double convex lens in the path of the three beams of light so that the middle beam strikes the centre 
 of the lens.<br>
 Note the beams on the opposite side of the lens from the source of light.<br>
 Repeat the experiment using a double concave lens.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="28.121H"></a>28.121 Refraction in a smoke box<br>
<a href="../images/28.212.gif">See diagram 28.212</a>: Refraction in a smoke box.<br>
Refraction is the change in direction of light as it crosses a boundary from one optical medium, e.g. glass, into another medium, e.g. air.<br>
 Light bends towards the normal when entering a medium that is optically more dense.<br>
 Light bends away from the normal when entering an optically less dense medium.<br>
 Light paths are reversible for refraction.<br>
 The incident ray, refracted ray, and normal to the boundary at the point of incidence, all lie in the same plane.<br>
Experiment<br>
Fasten a piece of black cardboard with a single hole in it 8 mm square 
 over the window of the smoke box.<br>
 Arrange a torch to shine a beam of light into the box.<br>
 Fill a large, preferably rectangular, bottle with water and add a few
 drops of milk or a pinch of starch or flour to make the water cloudy.<br>
 Cork the bottle.<br>
 Fill the box with smoke.<br>
 Hold the bottle at right angles to the beam of light and note the direction of the light through the water.<br>
 Tilt the bottle at different angles to the beam of light and note how the path of light through the bottle changes.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="28.122H"></a>28.122 Refraction in water illusion<br>
Refraction in water, pool depth, bent stick, rising coin.<br>
 <a href="../images/28.122.3.gif">See diagram 28.122.3</a>: Rising coin illusion.<br>
 <a href="../images/28.122.1.gif">See diagram 28.122.1</a>: Depths in a swimming pool.<br>
 <a href="../images/9.122.2.gif">See diagram 9.122.2 </a>: Bent stick illusion.<br>
Experiments<br>
 1. Drop three stones (P1, P2, P3) in a flat bottom swimming pool.<br>
 Drop P1 below you, P2 farther away and P3 at the far side.<br>
 Look at the three stones from a position directly above P1.<br>
 Stone P1 appears to be at the greatest depth, P2 at lesser depth and P3 at still 
 lesser depth.<br>
 The bottom of the swimming pool filled with water appears curved when
 viewed from above.<br>
 If the refractive index of water = 1.33, the apparent depth of the swimming 
 pool looking straight down, normal view, = 
 true depth / 1.33 = 3 /4 Ã— true depth.<br>
2. Place a stick in a tall container of water, 
so that part of the stick is above the surface.<br>
 Note where the stick enters the water.<br>
 The stick appears bent, because the light rays refract as they pass 
from water to air.<br>
 The image of each point on the stick below the water forms above its 
 real position, because of refraction at the air / water interface.<br>
3. Put a coin in a non-transparent, short and thick
 cup on the table.
 Stand away, and arrange your line of vision, so that you can just 
 see a point A on the far side of the coin.<br>
 Your view of the coin is almost shut out by the wall of the cup.<br>
 Keep the position of your head unchanged while pouring water into the 
 cup without moving the coin.<br>
 As you pour in the water, the coin appears to rise, so you can now see 
 the entire coin.<br>
 The positions of A1 and B1 are the intersection of the backwards extensions 
 of the refracted ray and the ray from A or B that is 
 vertical to the surface of water and not refracted.<br>
 The refracted ray from A is parallel to the refracted ray from B.<br>
4. More than half fill a tall transparent glass
 with water.<br>
 Insert a pencil so that the side of the pencil touches the right hand
 top of the glass and the lower end touches the left inner wall of the 
 glass, but not the bottom.<br>
 While looking down into the water, see the lower end of the pencil 
touching the wall and at the same time move your left finger from 
 up and down along the wall of the glass until you think the finger 
points to the lower end of the pencil.<br>
 Look through the side of the glass to see the actual position of the 
 pencil.<br>
 It is under your left finger.<br>
 The position of the left finger is the position of the image of the
 end of the pencil.<br>

<a href="../images/28.123.gif">See diagram 28.123</a>: Real depth and apparent depth of glass.<br>
Experiment<br>
 Place a block of glass on the table.<br>
 Place a pin close to the side of the glass at O.<br>
 The head of the pin may be seen from point A, at the edge of the glass 
 opposite O.<br>
 Place an inverted drawing pin at B on the glass.<br>
 Adjust the position of B so that its point, coincides with the image 
 of the pin at A seen through the glass.<br>
 Measure the lengths of OA and A2.<br>
 The plane CD with point A is the refraction plane of light, the refractive index from air into glass = 
 AO / A2.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="28.124H"></a>28.124 Refractive index using real depth and apparent depth, air to liquid<br>
<a href="../images/28.124.gif">See diagram 28.124</a>: Real depth and apparent depth of water.<br>
Real depth and apparent depth of water is the curving of light around edge object and consequent spreading when it passes through a narrow gap.<br>
 A single slit diffraction pattern differs from double slit interference.<br>
Experiments<br>
 1. Observe a vertical filament lamp slit formed by holding two finger
 together and looking through the narrow gap between the fingers.<br>
2. Attach a pin at O to the bottom of a beaker with
Plasticine (modelling clay).<br>
 Place the beaker on the white paper on the table.<br>
 Pour water into the beaker without disturbing the pin at O.<br>
 Look down to see the image I of the pin at O through the liquid surface.<br>
 Horizontally clamp another pin S to a stand near the beaker.<br>
 Adjust the stand to make S at the same height as I.<br>
 Mark the position of S on the outside of the beaker.<br>
 Pour off the water in the beaker without disturbing the pin at O.<br>
 Measure OL and IL, where L is a point on the surface of the water.<br>
 Repeat the experiment with different heights of water.<br>
 Calculate the reflective index from air into water = OL / IL.<br>

 <a href="../images/28.125.1.gif">See diagram 28.125.1</a>: Refraction through glass block.<br>
 <a href="../images/28.125.2.gif">See diagram 28.125.2 </a>: Refractive index.<br>
 Snell's law: sin i / sin r = n, a constant called the refractive index.<br>
 Substance and refractive index (for liquids at 20<sup>o</sup>C): diamond 2.4173, flint glass 1.655, crown glass 1.517, ethanol 1.361, 
 water 1.33299, carbon dioxide 1.00450, air 1.000293 vacuum 1.0.<br>
Experiments<br>
 1. Attach a black paper collar to the front of an electric torch.<br>
 Prepare a screen with a 1 cm diameter hole, or use a CD-ROM disc as
 a screen.<br>
 Hold the screen in front of the electric torch to limit the light beam 
 to a narrow, horizontal beam.<br>
 Put a rectangular container, e.g. a fish tank or transparent plastic 
 box, on a sheet of white paper on the table.<br>
 Draw a line on the white paper at right angles to the middle of the
 container, the normal.<br>
 Draw another line at 45<sup>o</sup> to the first line.<br>
 Fill the container with saltwater and add drops or milk or fluorescein.<br>
 Direct a beam of light along the 45<sup>o</sup> line into the container, 
 the incident ray.<br>
 Note the path of the beam of light through the water.<br>
 Use smoke or chalk dust scattered in the air to make the beam of light 
 visible in the air before entering and after leaving the container.<br>
 Look through the end of the container, looking along the ray, to see 
 that it is straight.<br>
 The angle between the normal and the incident ray is the angle of incidence, i.<br>
 The angle between the normal and the path of the light beam through
 the water is the angle of refraction, r.<br>
 Refractive index = sin i / sin r.<br>
 The beam of light leaving the container, after passing through the water, 
 is the emergent ray.<br>
 The incident ray and the emergent ray are parallel so there is lateral 
 displacement between them.<br>
 Lateral displacement depends on the breadth of the container, the angle 
 of incidence and the refractive index of the air and the solution<br>
 in the container.<br>
2. Repeat the experiment by putting a rectangular
 slab of glass, or a rectangular plastic box contained full of a transparent
 solution, 
 on white paper on the table.<br>
 Draw the outline of the slab on the white paper.<br>
 Place a pin, X, at the middle of the nearest side of the slab.<br>
 Draw a line through X at 45<sup>o</sup> to the side of the slab.<br>
 Look along the line and put two pins, A and B, on the line and two pins, 
 C and D, in line with A and B on the opposite side of the slab.<br>
 Put a pin, Y, where a line through DC meets the slab.<br>
 Remove the slab and draw the normal at X (X1 to X2) and the normal 
at Y (Y1 to Y2).<br>
 The path of the light ray is ABXYCD.<br>
 Use a protractor to measure the angle of incidence AXX1 and the angle
 of refraction X2XY.<br>
 Calculate the refractive index, sin AXX1 / sin X2XY.<br>
 Check that AXX1 = DYY1, and X2XY = Y2YX.<br>
 If refractive index of glass = 1.5, a glass slab viewed from the normal 
 appears to be 1 / 1.5 = 2 / 3 of its true thickness.<br>
3. Put a pin against the far face of a glass slab.<br>
 Hold a pointer down over the slab and move it until it is above the
 image of the pin, as seen through the slab.<br>
 If the true thickness of the slab = T, and the apparent thickness = 
AT, i.e. the distance of the pointer from the front of the slab, then 
 refractive index = T / TA.<br>

<a href="../images/28.217.gif">See diagram 28.217</a>: Image with a convex lens.<br>
Experiments<br>
 Darken all the windows in a room, but one.<br>
 Hold a convex lens (hand lens, magnifying glass) in the window and direct 
 it at the scene outside.<br>
 Bring a piece of white paper slowly near the lens until the image picture

 Note the position of the image.<br>

Magnifying glass, glass lens, magnification Ã— 3.75 mm diameter<br>
Magnifying glass, bifocal, plastic lens, magnification 2 Ã— and 6 Ã—3.75 mm diameter<br>
Magnifying lens, hand lens, folded magnifier, magnification 10 Ã—<br>
<a href="../images/28.218.gif">See diagram 28.218</a>: Magnifying power of a lens.<br>
Experiments<br>
 Use a magnifying glass to get a clear image of the lines in an exercise 
 book.<br>
 Adjust the distance of the magnifying glass so that a line seen through 
 the magnifying glass coincides with a line seen outside the 
 magnifying glass.<br>
 Compare the number of spaces seen outside the lens with a single space 
 seen through the lens.<br>
 The lens shown in the diagram magnifies three times.<br>
 Linear magnification is the ratio of the size (height) of the image
 to that of the object or the image distance to the object distance.<br>
 Magnification is the measure of enlargement or reduction of an object
 in an imaging optical system, e.g. X100.<br>
 In astronomy it is the factor by which an image produced by an optical 
 device increases the angular size of an object where 
 magnification of a telescope = focal length of the telescope / focal 
 length of the eyepiece.<br>

<a href="../images/28.1.17.gif">See diagram 28.1.17</a>: Water lens.<br>
Experiments<br>
 1. Roll the end of a copper wire around a thick nail to make a loop.<br>
 Cut the wire to leave a handle.<br>
 Dip the loop in water then take it out so that the water in the loop 
 is the shape of a convex lens.<br>
 Look at the loop from the side to see the shape of the convex lens 
with the centre thicker than the edges.<br>
 Use the water lens to look at a line in the palm of your hand.<br>
 Move the lens towards and away from your hand to see the line become 
 upright then inverted.<br>
2. Very gently knock the loop so that the meniscus breaks then reforms to form a new water lens in the shape of a concave lens.<br>
 Look at the loop from the side to see the shape of the concave lens
with the centre thinner than the edges.<br>
 Use the water lens to look at lines in the palm of your hand.<br>
 Move the lens backwards and forwards.<br>
3. Put a drop of water on a piece of clean glass.<br>
 Observe the lines in the palm of your hand again.<br>
 The drop of water acts as a magnifier.<br>
4. Use needle nose pliers to bend the end of a "slide on" paper clip to form a loop.<br>
 Dip the loop into a beaker of water then tap it against the side of
 the beaker to form a water lens inside the loop.<br>
 The water lens could be a convex lens (widest in the middle) or a concave 
 lens (thinnest in the middle).<br>
 Examine the letter "e" with your water lens.<br>
 Note whether the lens is a convex lens or concave lens.<br>
 Dry the loop and try to make the other kind of lens.<br>

<a href="../images/28.219.gif">See diagram 28.219</a>: Optical bench for studying lenses.<br>
An optical bench allows you to hold mirrors and lenses in position and to measure distances accurately with a metre scale.<br>
 Use wooden or plastic blocks with grooves that just fit over the metre 
 scale.<br>
 Stick a pin into the centre of each block.<br>
 Use strips of tin screwed to the side of the blocks to make lens holders.<br>
 Attach a torch bulb to a block as a light source.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="28.1.5H"></a>28.1.5 Refracting telescope, Galileo telescope<br>
<a href="../images/36.65.gif">See diagram 36.65</a>: Refracting telescope.<br>
Experiment<br>
 Use two convex lenses, one with long focus and slightly thick diameter, 
 another with short focus and slightly thin diameter.<br>
 Hold each lens opposite to some object afar.<br>
 Place a piece of white paper behind each lens to find the clearest 
image of the object on the paper.<br>
 Record the approximate value of each focus.<br>
 Use hard cardboard to roll two cylinders with nearly equal diameters 
 and fix a lens on each cylinder, the length of each cylinder 2-3 cm 
 longer than the focus of its lens.<br>
 The fixing methods: use a piece of hard cardboard to roll two cylinders
 that can enclose their lenses; control the cylinders with thread or 
 rubber tape then glue the cracks on their insides and outsides with
white adhesive plaster.<br>
 Glue a circle of hard cardboard strip at 0.5-1 cm from the rim of the
 slightly thick cylinder; place the long focus lens as the objective 
 lens at the left of the hardboard strip.<br>
 Then glue another circle of hard cardboard strip at the left of the
 lens so that the lens is fixed between two circles of hard cardboard 
 strips.<br>
 Like this, fix the short focus lens at the slightly thin cylinder as
 the eyepiece.<br>
 At another end of the slightly thick cylinder cut a 3 mm Ã— 1-2 cm quadrate 
 window whose longer sides are horizontal; at the opposite 
 side cut another same window, making sure that the focal plane of its
 lens is located at some axis section between the two windows.<br>
 Like this, cut two same windows with the above at another end of the 
 slightly thin cylinder.<br>
 Insert the thin cylinder into another one and screw the thin one to
 make the two pairs of windows just opposite.<br>
 Separately insert two M3 screws through the inside of the cylinders
 and gently screw two nuts on the outside.<br>
 Let the objective lens face some object afar with then gently move 
the thin cylinder horizontally.<br>
 You may see a clear image of the object when the two focal planes coincide.<br>
 Here a contracted, inverted, real image of an object afar forms at the 
 focal plane of the objective lens and the real image forms an 
 amplified virtual image infinite far from the eyepiece.<br>
 The amplification of this magnifying glass is the ratio of the focal length of the
 objective to that of the eyepiece.<br>

<a href="../images/28.120.gif">See diagram 28.120</a>: Ray diagrams for lenses.<br>
For the lens, the image forming properties depends on refraction through the lens material thus the focal length will depend both on 
 geometric factors and the index of refraction of material of the lens.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="28.4.0H"></a>28.4.0 Refraction of light<br>
 Light travels more slowly when it moves from a less dense medium to a more dense medium.<br>
 When the direction of the light is at right angles to the boundary, the wavelength decreases, but the frequency remains the same.<br>
 If light through air then glass then the refractive index of the glass = speed of light through the air / speed of light through the glass, so 
 here, refractive index must be &lt; 1.<br>
 When the direction of the light is not at right to the boundary, the 
 light changes speed and direction, because the light that first meets the 
 boundary slows before the light that later meets the boundary.<br>
 The change of speed and direction is called diffraction.<br>
 Deep and shallow water cause water waves to behave as if moving between

when entering shallow water.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="28.4.01H"></a>28.4.01 Refractive index<br>
<a href="../images/28.125.2.gif">See diagram 28.125.2</a>: Refractive index, Refraction at flat surfaces.<br>
 Refraction is the change in direction of light as it crosses a boundary from one optical medium, e.g. glass, into another optical medium,  e.g. as air.<br>
 Light bends towards the normal when entering a medium that is optically  more dense, and away from the normal when entering an  optically less dense medium.<br>
 Light paths are reversible for refraction.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="28.4.02H"></a>28.4.02 Laws of refraction, Snell's law<br>
 The incident ray, refracted ray, and normal to the boundary at the point 
 of incidence, all lie in the same plane.<br>
 Snell's law: sin i / sin r = refractive index, n.<br>
 Refractive index, n = sin i / sin r, where medium x is air and y is
another medium (n &gt;l).<br>
 Absolute refractive index of any medium is the ratio sin i / sin r for 
 light passing from a vacuum into that medium.<br>
 Absolute refractive index of glass is from vacuum to glass or glass
 to vacuum.<br>
 Relative refractive index of glass is from air to glass or from glass
 to air.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="28.4.03H"></a>28.4.03 Real depth and apparent depth<br> 
 Speed of light in a medium changes with Snell's law, so when looking from air into a more refractive medium, e.g. water, objects  appear to be at a shallower depth.<br>
 Apparent depth in water = real depth Ã— refractive index air / refractive index water.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="28.4.07H"></a>28.4.07 Refractive index of ice<br>
Ice model</a> (Commercial).<br>
Experiment<br>
 Freeze water by pumping in a hollow acrylic prism and measure the minimum 
 deviation.<br>
 If refractive index of water = 1.333, then for ice is 1.309.<br>
 By using a semi-circular tank to hold the liquid you can avoid the refraction 
 at one boundary.<br>
 Measuring critical angle rather than refraction angle avoids other 
problems.<br>
 This method is good for measuring the refractive index of ice, but getting 
 a good piece of clear ice of the right shape is not easy.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="28.4.2H"></a>28.4.2 Use same refractive index substances<br>
<a href="../images/28.4.2.gif">See diagram 28.4.2</a>: Cotton wool over methyl salicylate.<br>
<a href="../topics/topic09.html#3.4.2.5.1">See 3.4.2.5.1</a>: Ghost crystals, sodium polyacrylate, acrylic sodium salt polymer.<br>
 Also "Expanding Cubes", invisible in water (toy product)<br>
Experiments<br>
1. Place an eyedropper in a liquid using an index of refraction matched 
 to the glass.<br>
2. Use a small Pyrex beaker with graduations on
 the side or write words with a grease pen on the side.<br>
 Put the small beaker in a larger Pyrex beaker.<br>
 Pour an oil, e.g. Johnson's baby oil, Wesson oil, into the smaller 
beaker until it flows over into the larger beaker.<br>
 The part of the beaker below the surface of the oil almost disappears
 and the gradations or words seem to float on the oil.<br>
 The observations depend on the refractive index of the glass in the
 beaker being almost the same as the refractive index of the oil.<br>
 There is no reflection or change in refractive angle at a boundary 
between two transparent substances with the same refractive index.<br>
3. Place a small Pyrex beaker inside a larger beaker.<br>
 Pour Johnson's baby oil or Wesson oil into the smaller beaker until
 the baby oil overflows into the larger beaker.<br>
 As the baby oil gradually rises inside the larger beaker the smaller 
 beaker gradually disappears.<br>
 The baby oil has a refractive index equal in value to the refractive 
 index of the Pyrex glass.<br>
 Close matching of the refractive indices make the smaller beaker practically 
 invisible.<br>
 If the beaker has graduations or words they will appear to be floating 
 in the liquid.<br>
 Many young students are fascinated by this experiment.<br>
4. Wind white wool around a small heavy object, 
 e.g. a coin, until you cannot see the object.<br>
 Drop the wrapped object into methyl salicylate solution.<br>
 As the wool absorbs the methyl salicylate it become transparent and
 you can see the object again.<br>
5. Divide a large jar into two sections with a
sieve of glass rods.<br>
 The upper section of the jar contains a wad of fluffy cotton wool.<br>
 The lower section of the beaker contains methyl salycilate liquid.<br>
 The cotton wool remains in place, because it has been stuffed into the 
 jar and is pushing against the sides of the jar.<br>
 It remains dry, because it does not touch the methyl salicylate liquid
 below.<br>
 However, the cotton wool contains a secret coin hidden in the centre.<br>
 The coin cannot be seen, because the dry cotton wool is opaque.<br>
 Invert the jar so the methyl salicylate saturates the cotton wool.<br>
 The saturated cotton becomes transparent so the coin hidden in the centre 
 of the cotton wool can be seen.<br>
6. Use two microscope slides and cut a piece of
 Perspex with glass side walls made of slides, glued together with silicon, 
 to make a 
 mini tank to test refraction with different salt solutions, type of
 salt used and concentrations.<br>
 However, the changes are very small and you need precision equipment 
 to measure them.<br>
 Use a spectroscope with a vernier gauge for measuring angle changes, 
 down to 0.01 degree to measure of index of refraction of salt and 
 sugar concentrations in water.<br>
 Measuring refractive index with temperature change is difficult, because 
 the temperature of the solution changes too quickly so cannot be 
 certain of what the temperature was when the angle reading was taken.<br>
7. If using glass jars and glass fish tanks it
is difficult to get reliable data.<br>
 Ray boxes with white light seem to spread the beam too widely.<br>
 Laser pointers give a good beam across the base of a fish tank, but it
 is difficult to mark the exit point as the beam refracts leaving the tank.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="28.4.6H"></a>28.4.6 Mirage illusion<br>
 A mirage is an optical illusion usually caused by refraction in heated air.<br>
 It may also appear as the reflected image in the sky of a distant object.<br>
 A mirage results from seeing through turbulent air, e.g. puddles of
 water may appear on an ascending hot road, water lake in the 
 desert, heat shimmers over engines.<br>
 A mirage can be photographed, so it is not a delusion.<br>
Experiments<br>
1. Look at an object on the other side of a hot engine or a hot road.<br>
The object will appear distorted, because the refractive indexes of warm and cold air are different.<br>
This is one cause of mirages in the desert.<br>
2. To create a mirage, direct the image from a slide projector just above 
 a brass plate heated with a Bunsen burner.<br>

 Note the direction of the beam through the water.<br>
 Raise the piece of cardboard so that the beam of sunlight strikes the 
 surface of the milky water.<br>
 Observe how the beam changes direction where it hits the water.<br>
 The beam is refracted.<br>
 Note that the angle between the surface of the milky water and the refracted 
 beam depends on the angle between the water and in 
 incoming, incident, beam.<br>
 To observe clearer, place another cardboard above the cup to shade

2. If sunlight is not strong use a torch in a black box with a hole in the bottom to allow a beam of light to fall on the surface of the milky 
 water at an angle &gt; 90<sup>o</sup>.<br>

occurs.<br>
3. Pour a few drops of milk into a glass of water to cloud the water.<br>
 Punch a small hole in a piece of dark paper or cardboard.<br>
 Place the glass in direct sunlight, and hold the card upright in front

 First hold the card so that the hole is just below the water level.<br>
 Note the direction of the beam in the water.<br>
 Then raise the card until the beam strikes the surface of the water.<br>
 Note the direction of the beam of light and 
 experiment to find out how the angle at which the beam strikes the water 
 affects the direction of the beam in the water.<br>

 Images are always virtual, upright, diminished, and less than one focal

Convex lens (converging lens)<br>
 Parallel light rays converge through the principal focus.<br>
 Real image forms when object is more than one focal length from the
 lens.<br>
 Virtual image forms when object is less than one focal length from 
the lens.<br>
 Convex (converging) lenses are wider in the middle than at the edges.<br>
 Parallel light converges through a point called the principal focus, 
 F.<br>
 Images in a convex (converging) lens: Real images form when an object
 is further than one focal length from the lens.<br>
 (1 / v - 1 / u = 1 / f), where u is the object distance from the lens, 
 v is the image distance from the lens, f is the focal length of the lens.<br>
 Magnification = (Hi / Ho) = (f / So) = (Si / f = v / u), where Ho is 
 the height of the object, Hi is the height of the image,<br>
 So = object distance from the principal focus, Si = image distance 
from the principal focus.<br>
 Virtual images form when the object is less than one focal length from 
 the lens.<br>
 The types and positions of the image formed by a converging lens depend 
 on u, v, f, and their relationship.<br>
 Image is a picture or appearance of a real object, formed by light 
that passes through a lens or is reflected from a mirror.<br>
 If rays of light actually pass through an image, it is called a real 
 image.<br>
 A mirror forms an image by the law of reflection.<br>
 The focal length of a mirror depends only on geometrical considerations, because the 
 properties of the material do not affect the focal length when light 
 reflects from a mirror surface.<br>
 For the lens, the image forming properties depends on refraction through 
 the lens material thus the focal length will depend both on 
 geometric factors and the index of refraction of material of the lens.<br>
 For both lenses and mirrors, the image and object distances are related 
 by the same equation:<br>
 (u<sup>-1</sup>+ v<sup>-1 </sup>= f<sup>-1</sup>) or (1 / f = 1 / u
 + 1 / v),<br>
 where u is the distance from the object to the optical centre of the 
 lens or to the mirror pole viz.<br>
 object distance, v is the distance from the image to the optical centre 
 of the lens or to the mirror pole viz.<br>
 image distance, f is the focal length of the lens, which is positive 
 for converging lenses and negative for diverging lenses.<br>
 The types and positions of the image formed by a converging lens depend 
 on u, v, f, and their relationship.<br>

 A birefringent material has a different refractive index in the two
 dimensions, i.e., a different speed for left-handed and right-handed 
 helixes, slowing one down with respect to the other.<br>
 When polarized light passes through, this differential results in a
rotation of the plane of polarization.<br>
 So crossed Polaroids are no longer crossed when material in between
 has caused a rotation.<br>
 The amount of rotation depends on the degree of orientation of the polymer 
 molecules and thickness of the film.<br>

Refractometers are instruments to measure substances dissolved in water and certain oils.<br>
Refractometers are used to determine the amount of dissolved solids in liquids by passing light through a sample and showing the refracted angle on a scale.<br>
The scale most commonly used is referred to as the Brix scale.<br>
The Brix scale is defined as: the number of grams of pure cane sugar dissolved in 100 grams of pure water (grams sugar/100 grams H20).<br>
Other scales have been developed to measure salt, serum proteins (albumen) and urine specific gravity.<br>
Sugar Refractometer 0 ~ 32%, Used to test the sugar content of fruit, fruit juices, wine, milk, soft drinks and yeast cultures.<br>
