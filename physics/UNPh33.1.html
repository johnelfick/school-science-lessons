<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="33.1.0H">33.1.0</a> Anode and cathode<br>
An anode is a positive electrode or terminal.<br>
anode (Greek <i>anodos</i> way up)<br>
A cathode is a negative electrode or terminal<br>
cathode (Greek <i>kathodos</i> way down)<br>
An electrode is a device to facilitate the conduction of electricity into or out of something.<br>
electrode (Greek <i>hodos</i> way).<br>
Electrodes are conductors through which electric current enters or leaves the electrolyte.<br>
Cations are positive ions attracted to the negative cathode.<br>
Anions are negative ions anions are attracted to the positive anode.<br>
In both electrochemical cells and electrolytic cells:<br>
cations (positive ions), Na+, move towards the cathode and anions (negative ions) e.g. Cl-, move towards the anode.<br>
Battery terminals are labelled positive, +ve, and negative, -ve, according to voltage.<br>
This is because the positive terminal remains at a positive voltage relative to the other terminal.<br>
Oxidation, the loss of electrons from the ions in solution to the electrode, occurs at the anode.<br>
Reduction, the gain of electrons from the electrode to the ions in solution, occurs at the cathode.<br>
If the electrolyte is a salt consisting of a metal and non-metal, the metal precipitates at the cathode and the non-metal precipitates at the anode.<br>
In both electrochemical cells and electrolytic cells, electrons carry current through the external circuit and ions carry current through the solutions.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="33.4.0H">33.4.0</a> Conventional current<br>
If "current" is the conventional positive current, in metal wires, the current is carried by electrons moving in the direction opposite to the current.<br>
In conventional current, the cathode of a battery is the terminal where current flows out and the anode is the terminal where current flows in.<br>
Conventional current passes from the positive terminal, through a circuit, to the negative terminal of the battery, from cathode to anode.<br>
In a discharging battery or a galvanic cell, the cathode is the positive terminal since that is where the conventional current flows out of the device.<br>

Electrolytes may be acids, bases or salts dissolved in water.<br>
Electrolytes are liquids containing ions that may be decomposed by electrolysis, e.g. the solution in a car battery.<br>
Electrolytes form ions when dissolves in water.<br>
Living cells, blood and other tissues contain electrolytes.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="33.9.0H">33.9.0</a> Weston Standard Cell<br>
(Edward Weston, 1850-1936)<br>
<a href="../images/3.33.01.gif">See diagram 3.33.01</a> : Weston Standard Cell.<br>
The Weston Standard Cell is a glass "H" tube with platinum wires sealed into the bottom of each "H" in contact with the electrodes.<br>
The positive electrode is liquid mercury under a mercurous sulfate paste.<br>
The negative electrode is a cadmium / mercury amalgam.<br>
Above the electrodes is cadmium sulfate solution.<br>
The "saturated cell" has a layer of cadmium sulfate crystals above the electrodes and is used for very accurate measurements.<br>
The "unsaturated cell" has packing to restrain the electrodes and is the most common, being portable.<br>
The Weston Standard Cell became the international standard of voltage in 1908, 1.01830 International Volts at 20  oC .<br>
So the cell must be kept at a constant temperature for accurate measurements.<br>
It still can be used as a DC voltage reference.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="33.1.1H">33.1.1</a> Ionic migration<br>
 Migration of coloured ions in an electrolyte can be shown with a flat chamber the size of a microscope slide and coloured ions, e.g. MnO4-, Cu2+, Cr2O2.<br>
 Dissolve some sodium sulfate in sufficient water to half fill a U-tube.<br>
 Add drops of universal indicator that is red in acidic solutions and blue purple in alkaline solutions.<br>
 The colour of the indicator should be green showing that the solution is neutral.<br>
 To an equal volume of water add 1 gram agar agar gel for each 100 mL of water.<br>
 Warm until the gel dissolves and then mix the two solutions.<br>
 Pour this solution into the U-tube until the arms are about half full.<br>
 When the gel has set, pour dilute sulfuric acid into one arm and dilute sodium hydroxide into the other.<br>
 Insert platinum or carbon electrodes into the solutions.<br>
 Connect the electrode in contact with sulfuric acid to the positive terminal of a battery.<br>
 Connect the electrode in contact with the sodium hydroxide solution to the negative terminal of the battery.<br>
 Allow the current to pass for some time and observe the colour changes produced in each arm.<br>
 The violet colour in the gel below the sodium hydroxide solution is because of the movement of hydroxide ions into it under the influence of the electric
 field.<br>
 The red colour in the gel below the sulfuric acid solution is because of the movement of hydrogen ions into it.<br>
 So there is evidence for a two way flow of ions.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="33.2.1H">Battery</a><br>
 Battery , origin, use of the term "battery"<br>
1. Originally, a "battery" was a combination of pieces of artillery, but this military term was first used to describe the first use of linked Leyden jars.<br>
The first electrochemical battery was Alessandro Volta's pile of copper and zinc plates, separated by paper discs soaked in salt solution, so called a voltaic pile.<br>
A battery is a source of electrical energy with electromotive force, EMF, measured in volts, equal to the potential difference between its terminals, 
assuming no loss of internal energy in the battery.<br>
A battery is an external electricity source applied to an electrolytic cell that forces electrons around the circuit through the cell away from its the negative 
terminal and towards its positive terminal.<br>
The term "battery" refers to several joined electrical cells, but one dry cell is commonly called a "battery", e.g. a torch battery, (flashlight battery).<br>
2. Battery current<br>
The electric current is carried as ions in the electrolyte within the electrolytic cell.<br>
A current whose direction does not change with time is called direct current.<br>
The current whose current intensity is invariable in the circuit is called constant current.<br>
3. Battery potential<br>
The end of the resistor where current enters is the high potential end.<br>
Current flows through a resistor from high potential to low potential.<br>
The positive terminal of a battery is always the high potential terminal, assuming the internal resistance is small.<br>
In the external circuit of the electrical source, the constant current flows from the high potential to the low potential.<br>
In the internal circuit of the electrical source, the current flows from the low potential to the high potential.<br>
4. Battery sizes
Common batteries provide 1.5 volts are sold in sizes AAA very small, AA small, C medium, and D large.<br>
So four cells in series gives 6 volts and six cells in series gives 9 volts.<br>
A battery supplies direct current from two or more connected electrochemical cells.<br>
5. Dry cell batteries<br>
A dry cell has the electrolyte in paste form that should not leak out of the battery.<br>
 Dry cell "batteries" include the following:<br>
 * Alkaline batteries (1.5 V) in cassette players and portable radios,<br>
 * Cadmium cells, Weston standard cadmium cells, cadmium amalgam + mercury electrodes, cadmium sulfate electrolyte.<br>
 * Nickel metal hydride batteries, discharge at 30% per month, also ready to use low self-discharge batteries,<br>
 * Nickel cadmium batteries (1.4 V) that are rechargeable and can produce a high current,<br>
 * Silver-oxide cells (1.5 V) in calculators, cameras and watches,<br>
 * Lithium ion batteries, replaced the lithium cadmium batteries, Li+, move from -ve electrode to +ve electrode when discharging<br>
 * Zinc carbon batteries (1.5 V), low cost, but short life.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="33.2.2H">33.2.2</a> Battery comparison<br>
Connect different dry cell batteries to a light bulb or a clock.<br>
Note the length of time the bulb remains lit or when the clock stops.<br>
Researchers have found that the battery lasting the longest was "Duracell", then "Energizer", then "Eveready".<br>
This sequence reflects the relative cost of the battery.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="33.2.3H">33.2.3</a> Battery disposal<br>
In USA, battery labels must include the battery chemistry, the " three chasing arrows" and instruction that user must recycle or dispose of the battery properly.<br>
Primary batteries and secondary batteries that no longer function should be disposed of according to local environmental regulations on disposal of batteries.<br>
The Australian Battery Recycling Initiative (ABRI) is formed by battery manufacturers, recyclers, retailers, government bodies and environment groups 
 to promote the collection, recycling and safe disposal of all batteries.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="33.2.4H">33.2.4</a> Battery sulfation<br>
 Sulfation on plates of a lead-acid battery, secondary cell, causes reduced efficiency, because PbSO4 forms.<br>
 Sulfation is the effect of overcharging or other environmental conditions in lead acid batteries that leads to permanent capacity loss.<br>
 Flakes of lead sulfate break away from the plates and fall to the bottom of the cell, where they can no longer react and produce energy.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="33.2.5H">3.1.2.5</a> Battery uses, types of batteries<br>

Nickel-cadmiumn (NICAD, nickel metal hydride (NiMH)<br>
Transistor batteries, introduced for the early transistor radios are nine volt batteries.<br>
They have a rectangular prism shape with rounded edges and connector at the top.<br>
They are used in portable radios, smoke detectors, gas detectors.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="33.2.6H">33.2.6</a> C-Rates of batteries</a><br>
"C-rate" is a measure of the rate at which a battery is being discharged relative to its maximum capacity.<br>
C is the nominal capacity in Ah or mAh.<br>
At the "1 C rate", a 1.8 Ah battery should be able to deliver 1.8 A in one hour.<br>
If discharged at 0.5 C rate, the nominal charge lasts two hours.<br>
If discharged at 2C rate, the nominal charge lasts thirty minutes.<br>
When C-rate is applied to charging:<br>
&gt; 0.5 C is fast charging,<br>
0.2 C to 0.5 C is normal charging,<br>
0.05 C to 0.2 C is trickle charging.<br>
Too fast charging or discharging may generate heat inside the battery.<br>
Too slow charging or discharging lowers effective capacity, because all batteries have some internal self-discharging.<br>

 Hold the bulb in your hand and dip the magnesium and copper into a beaker of dilute sulfuric acid or a solution of sodium hydrogen sulfate.<br>
 The bulb lights, and bubbles of hydrogen gas form on the copper strip.<br>
 The chemical reaction between the magnesium and the acid causes a current of electricity to flow along the wire and light the bulb.<br>
 The current also makes the hydrogen gas bubbles come out of the acid at the copper strip, although the copper itself does not react.<br>

 The magnesium body acts as the anode.<br>
2. Use a screwdriver to remove the steel blade from a magnesium pencil sharpener.<br>
 Use crocodile clips to connect the positive wire from a voltmeter to the steel blade and the negative wire to the magnesium.<br>
 Dip the steel and magnesium electrodes into a dilute sodium chloride solution in a Petri dish.<br>

 Repeat the experiment by substituting cola for the sodium chloride solution.<br>
 Record the voltage measured by the voltmeter (about 1.9 V).<br>
 Observe tiny bubbles on the steel blade electrode.<br>
 This experiment shows that cola would function better as a salt bridge then sodium chloride solution!<br>
This may be because acids in the cola contribute hydrogen ions that were reduced to hydrogen gas.<br>
 At the anode, oxidation occurs: Mg --> Mg2+ + 2e-<br>
 At the cathode, reduction occurs: 2H+ + 2e- --> H2<br>

A potato battery is an electrochemical battery.<br>
The zinc in the nail reacts with the copper wire.<br> 
The potato acts as a buffer between the zinc ions and the copper ions.<br> 
The zinc and copper ions would still react if they touched within the potato, but they would only generate heat.<br>
 Since the potato keeps them apart, the electron transfer has to take place over the copper wires of the circuit, which channels

 Experiment<br>
 1. Put a piece of zinc metal and a piece of copper metal into a large beaker 3 / 4 full of dilute sulfuric acid.<br>
 Connect a galvanometer between the zinc metal and the copper metal.<br>
 Observe the deflection of the galvanometer needle, many hydrogen gas bubbles on the copper surface, but few bubbles on the zinc surface.<br>
 Zinc atoms transfer their electrons to the copper, so zinc atoms become zinc ions into the solution.<br>
 The copper transfers the electrons to hydrogen ions to form hydrogen gas by the contact surface of the copper with sulfuric acid.<br>
 The copper acts as catalyst.<br>
 2. Use a beaker containing dilute (5%) sulfuric acid, copper and zinc electrodes and a galvanometer to show current flow.<br>
 Note which electrode the bubbles gather on and how this affects the reading on the galvanometer?<br>
 Stir the liquid to dislodge the bubbles and read the galvanometer again.<br>
 3. Put some strong aqueous copper (II) sulfate solution in a beaker.<br>
 Connect copper foil to the positive terminal of a voltmeter and a zinc rod or foil to the other terminal.<br>
 Dip the two metals briefly into the copper (II) sulfate solution.<br>
 Note the readings on the voltmeter.<br>
 The voltage falls to zero after a short time, because copper deposited on the zinc and caused the reaction to stop.<br>
 Note what happens at the copper rod and at the zinc rod.<br>
 Determine the direction of electron flow.<br>
 4. Pour concentrated copper (II) sulfate solution into a beaker.<br>
 Insert a sheet copper and sheet zinc into the solution.<br>
 Measure the voltage drop by connecting the copper to the +ve terminal of a voltmeter and the zinc to the -ve terminal.<br>
 Record the reading.<br>
 Observe that the sheet zinc dissolves and hydrogen gas bubbles form on the surface of the copper.<br>
Observe that the voltage will decrease to zero with increasing of the copper on the sheet zinc.<br>
 5. Repeat the experiment with magnesium ribbon, an iron nail or lead foil instead of the zinc.<br>
 Record the voltage each time.<br>
 The larger the difference in activity between two metals, the larger the voltage.<br>
 When copper deposits on the zinc electrode, it prevents more zinc from entering the solution.<br>
 This causes the voltage fall to zero after a short time and the cell becomes "dead".<br>
 You can add some subsidiary devices to prevent this happening.<br>
 6. Use a beaker containing dilute sulfuric acid, pieces of copper and zinc as electrodes, a switch, conducting wire and a galvanometer.<br>
 Note on which electrode the bubbles gather.<br>
 Note the effect of their formation on the galvanometer.<br>

 Instead of zinc and copper strips use two zinc strips and, later, two copper strips.<br>
 Note any current flow in either case.<br>
 7. Use an aluminium patty pan, the small disposable pan used in the oven for making cup cakes.<br>
 Put a salt solution in the pan and test different metals and objects, e.g. coins, hair pins, wires, as electrodes.<br>

 The zinc dissolves in the acid.<br>
 Hydrogen comes from the copper.<br>
 From these reactions electrons flow through the external circuit producing a voltage of 1.1 V.<br>
 If a 1.5 V light bulb is connected in series, the light bulb glows for a short time then fades.<br>
 This happens because the hydrogen bubbles collecting on the copper strip reduces the flow of electric current.<br>
 Make the filament continue to glow by mechanically removing the bubbles or by adding the oxidizing agent potassium dichromate to the acid in the cell.<br>

 You can measure capacity of a cell or accumulator in the number of ampere hours of charge it can deliver.<br>
 The capacity of the cell and its work principle depend on the volume.<br>
 The more the capacity the cell has, the greater work current appliance can be used and the longer the times it is used.<br>

 The Daniell Cell has a zinc plate in zinc sulfate solution and a copper plate in copper sulfate solution, with the two solutions separated by a porous

 It produces about 1.08 volts.<br>
 It was once used as a voltage standard, but it has a short life and the EMF it produces in not constant.<br>
 Also, the electrodes must be removed from the electrolyte when the cell is not in use.<br>
 Experiment<br>
 1. The Daniell cell has EMF about 1.1 volts, and low internal resistance.<br>
 It is a primary cell whose EMF is constant for a considerable period of time and maintains a steady, small current.<br>
 However, since the copper (II) sulfate solution slowly diffuses through the clay porous pot to attack the zinc rod, the cell must be emptied and washed
 after use.<br>
 The Daniell cell uses a battery jar, clay porous pot, zinc electrode cylinder, copper electrode rod, 10% copper (II) sulfate solution, 10% zinc sulfate
 solution.<br>
 Put sheet zinc in a beaker containing zinc sulfate solution or dilute sulfuric acid solution.<br>
 Put a sheet copper in another beaker containing saturated copper (II) sulfate solution.<br>
 Connect the copper to the positive terminal of a voltmeter and the zinc to the negative terminal of the voltmeter.<br>
 Observe the voltmeter reading is zero.<br>
 Make a simple salt bridge by soaking filter paper in a concentrated solution of an electrolyte, e.g. sodium chloride or potassium nitrate.<br>
 Fix the filter paper to dip into the zinc sulfate and copper (II) sulfate solutions.<br>

 The voltmeter shows that current is flowing.<br>
 Disconnect the voltmeter and substitute a 1.5 volt bulb, ammeter, and conducting wire.<br>
 Examine the electrodes after two minutes.<br>
 Note the zinc corrodes and new copper has deposited on the copper electrode.<br>
 Observe whether the copper (II) sulfate solution loses some of its blue colour.<br>
 To prolong the life of the salt bridge, make a permanent salt bridge from a glass U-tube filled with a 1 M aqueous potassium nitrate solution.<br>
 You can mix the solution with agar gel to keep it in the U-tube.<br>
 Put cotton wool plugs at each end of the U-tube.<br>

 Insert a 1.5 V light bulb in place of the voltmeter and note whether it lights.<br>
 Insert an ammeter into the circuit to find the current flowing.<br>
 Note whether you can vary the current by moving the copper electrode nearer to the zinc electrode, or by altering the surface area of the copper foil 
 by raising and lowering it in the solution.<br>
 Oxidation occurs at the zinc anode, losing electrons to the electric circuit.<br>
 Reduction occurs at the copper cathode, gaining electrons from the electric circuit.<br>
 At the anode, zinc atoms lose two electrons to become zinc ions, Zn2+.<br>
 At the cathode, copper ions, Cu2+ receive two electrons from the electric circuit to become copper atoms.<br>
 The zinc ions in solution gather around the zinc anode.<br>
 The copper ions are removed from solution when they are reduced to copper metal and join the copper cathode.<br>
 In the solution, sulfate ions move towards the zinc anode and copper (II) ions move towards the copper cathode.<br>
 Positive ions, cations, move towards the cathode and negative ions, anions, move towards the anode.<br>
 So charge is carried by ions in solution and carried by electrons in the electric circuit.<br>
 The reactions continue until all the zinc in the anode joins the solution or all the copper ions are plated onto the cathode.<br>

 So this electrode becomes positively charged.<br>
 Electrons travel from the negatively charged electrode to the positively charged electrode through the wire, so they flow from the anode to the cathode, 
 i.e. from the zinc electrode to the tin electrode.<br>
 The half cells are linked by a salt bridge separator that allows transfer of ions, but not water.<br>
 The salt bridge contains a solution of a salts, e.g. NaNO3, KNO3, NaCl or KCl.<br>
 They do not take part in the reaction, but when the half cells are connected ions move between the salt bridge and the half cells.<br> 
 So that the whole cell remains neutral and to complete the circuit.<br>
 In the anode half cell, Zn2+ (aq) ions enter the solution as oxidation occurs, leading to a build up of positively charged cations in the solution.<br>
 However, anions in the salt bridge, e.g. NO3- (aq) or Cl- (aq), flow into the half cell to neutralize the solution.<br>
 In the cathode half cell, Sn2+ (aq) ions leave the solution as reduction occurs, leading to a loss of positively charged cations in the solution.<br>
 However, cations in the salt bridge, e.g. Na+ (aq) or K+ (aq), flow into the half cell to neutralize the solution.<br>
 Using the standard cell potentials.<br>
 E = -0.76 V for Zn2+ / Zn (s),<br>
 E = -0.14 V for Sn2+ / Sn (s),<br>
 So value for the Sn2+ / Sn (s) half cell is less negative:<br>
 Sn2+ (aq) + 2e- --> Sn (s),<br>
 Zn (s) --> Zn2+ (aq) + 2e-,<br>
 Zn2+ (aq) + Zn (s) --> Cu (s) + Zn2+ (aq)<br>
 In the zinc and tin galvanic cell, the standard cell potential is the reading on the voltmeter when the cells are first connected:<br>
 Ecell = E reduction half cell - E oxidation half cell = (-0.14 V) - (-0.76 V) = + 0.62 V<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="33.7.5H">33.7.5</a> Leclanché cell<br>
Leclanché cell, dry cell, electric torch, (flashlight) battery<br>
 <a href="../images/3.88ch.gif">See diagram 3.88</a> : Leclanché cell.<br>
 <a href="../images/32.150.gif">See diagram 32.150</a> : Torch battery cut vertically.<br>
 A Leclanché cell is a primary voltaic cell with a carbon rod anode, zinc cathode, dilute ammonium chloride solution electrolyte and e.m.f. 
 approximately 1.5 volts.<br>
(Georges Leclanché. 1839-1882, France)<br> 
 Zn + H2SO4 --> (discharge) ZnSO4 + H2O + H2 (g)<br> 
 The term "battery" refers to several joined electrical cells, but one dry cell is commonly called a "battery", e.g. a torch battery, (flashlight battery).<br>
 A torch "battery" is the dry cell version of the Leclanché cell.<br>
 It has manganese dioxide [manganese (IV) oxide] around the carbon rod to oxidize hydrogen and so depolarize the anode.<br>
 The electrolyte is in the form of a water paste so the dry cell is not really "dry".<br>
 2MnO2 + H2 --> Mn2O3 + H2O<br>
 manganese dioxide + hydrogen --> dimanganese trioxide + water.<br>
 1. Remove the outer covering from an old dry cell.<br> 
 Use a saw to cut the cell in half and note its structure.<br>
 Note the carbon (+ve terminal) conducting rod that runs along the axis.<br>
 The zinc canister is the -ve terminal.<br>
 The material between the two terminals is the electrolyte.<br>
 Note how the zinc has been eaten away by the chemical.<br>
 In older batteries, the canister leaked if two much of the zinc canister dissolved.<br>
 However, nowadays the canister has an outer jacket to ensure that the battery is "leak proof".<br>
 However, batteries may still link if they are left in the sun and a build-up of hydrogen gas ruptures insulating seals or the outer jacket.<br>
 Alkaline batteries containing KOH electrolyte may rupture to form white feather-like crystals of potassium carbonate when the KOH reacts with the CO2 in the air.<br>
2. Add 1 mL of phenolphthalein indicator to 2 cm of ammonium chloride solution in a shallow dish.<br>
 Attach a crocodile clip and conducting wire to a carbon rod from a dry cell battery and a piece of zinc foil.<br>
 Join the conducting wires.<br>
 Dip the carbon rod and zinc foil into the solution to act as electrodes.<br>
 Note any changes around the electrodes.<br>
3. The voltage from a single "battery" is usually about 1.5 V, however maximum current varies with the type of battery.<br>
 Batteries for radios produce a small current for long periods, e.g. 4 amps.<br>
 Batteries for torches or flashlights produce a large current for short periods, e.g. 6 amps.<br>
 Connect an ammeter directly across the terminals of different types of batteries.<br>
 4. Use a saw to cut through a used dry cell lengthways.<br>
 The central carbon rod is the positive electrode.<br>
 The zinc container is the negative electrode.<br>
 The moist paste contains the electrolyte ammonium chloride that acts like an acid in dissolving zinc and the MnO2 that acts as a depolarizer by oxidizing hydrogen.<br>
 It slowly oxidizes hydrogen to water so that any hydrogen formed cannot block the flow of electric charge.<br>
 If the power from a dry cell fades after continual use, the power may be restored after some hours, because of the depolarizing action of the MNO2.<br>
 In a used battery, the zinc appears eaten away, because some of it has gone into solution.<br>
 5. Cut down one side of a dry cell battery with a hacksaw.<br>
 Scoop out the contents and put them in a beaker half full of water, then stir.<br>
 Put cotton wool in the neck of a funnel to act as a filter.<br>
 Pour the contents of the beaker into the funnel.<br>
 The black substance remaining in the cotton wool is mainly manganese dioxide.<br>
 Evaporate the clear solution that had passed through the filter.<br>
 White ammonium chloride and some zinc chloride remain after evaporation.<br>
 Test for ammonia by adding solid sodium bicarbonate and heat until you can smell the ammonia given off.<br>
 Also, a white precipitate of zinc hydroxide forms that dissolves again to form the zincate ion [<span class="GramEH">Zn(</span>OH)4]2-.<br>
 6. Mix 4 g of carbon black, powdered carbon, with 10 g manganese (IV) oxide, the oxidant.<br>
 Stir in ammonium chloride solution to make a thick paste.<br>
 Make a zinc can made from zinc foil rolled into a cylinder or a cleaned zinc can from an old dry cell.<br>
 Cut absorbent paper to make a cylinder to line the zinc can.<br>
 Place the mixture on the absorbent paper, compress it into a cylinder and wrap the absorbent paper around the cylinder so that it just fits inside the zinc can.<br>
 Pour ammonium chloride solution between the paper and the zinc to ensure good contact.<br>
 Press the mixture into the zinc can firmly and tightly.<br>
 Attach a crocodile clip and conducting wire to a carbon rod from an old dry cell.<br>
 Press the carbon rod down the centre of the mixture so that it almost touches the bottom of the zinc can.<br>
 Connect another crocodile clip and conducting wire to the zinc container.<br>
 This cell should light a 1.5 V light bulb and run a small 1.5 V electric motor.<br>
 The carbon lowers the internal resistance of the cell.<br>
 Test the voltage and the current from the cell.<br>
 Zn (s) ---> Zn2+ (aq) + 2e- (oxidation)<br>
 2NH4+ (aq) + 2MnO2 (s) + 2e- ---> Mn2O3 (s) + 2NH3 (aq) + H2O (aq) (reduction)<br>

 There is almost no deflection.<br>
 4. Use a lemon, orange or any juicy fruit, a copper wire, a coated iron wire a centre zero galvanometer out of the storeroom, a voltmeter, 0 to 10 volts.<br>
 Put the different kinds of wire in turn into the lemon the acidified water
Add a few drops of dilute sulfuric acid, and acidified hydrogen gas peroxide solution, 5 mL of hydrogen peroxide + a few drops of dilute sulfuric acid.<br>
 Connect the wires to a galvanometer in each case and observe the pointer when the wires are in each electrolyte or solution, e.g. fruit juice, or H2O2 solution.<br>
 Leave the wires in the acid and see that the zinc dissolves off the iron beneath it.<br>
 The copper cathode seems unchanged, but is covered with bubbles of hydrogen gas.<br>
 The peroxide removes these bubbles.<br>
 Try to light a 11 / 2 volt globe.<br>
 The a series connection means copper of one cell to zinc of the next cell.<br>

 6. Make two slits in the skin of a lemon and push
 a piece of copper (positive terminal), and a zinc washer or piece of aluminium foil, (negative terminal.<br>
 Attach wires to make a circuit.<br>
 A chemical reaction takes place between the metals and the acid in the lemon juice, causes the current to flow and light a 1.5 volt bulb.<br>
 7. To make a lemon battery / voltaic cell, "Lemon screamer lasagne cell", stick copper and galvanized steel electrodes into a lemon.<br>
 Attach a voltmeter or a galvanometer.<br>
 Repeat the experiment with a same size potato.<br>
 8. Squeeze lemon juice over pieces of absorbent paper so that they become damp, but not dripping wet.<br>
 Make an alternating pile of 2p and 10 p (UK) coins with a piece of wet absorbent paper between each coin.<br>
 The larger coin should be at the top and the bottom of the pile.<br>
 Wet the tips of the index finger and the thumb, pick up the pile of coins and squeeze the coins tightly.<br>
 Fell the slight electric shock.<br>
 This experiment may not work, but it is worth trying with your local coins.<br>
 The British coins have change composition.<br>
 Since 1992, the two pence 2.03 mm thickness coin is made of copper-plated steel.<br>
 Since 2012, the ten pence 2.05 mm thickness coin is made of nickel-plated steel.<br>
 9. Make a lemon-powered clock<br>
 Use a digital clock without a plug, powered by two AA batteries, two galvanized nails, e.g. 16d (3.5 inches), two lengths of bare copper wire
 + 3 crocodile clips.<br>
 Cut a large lemon in halves to form half lemon A, and half lemon B.<br>
 Push the galvanized nails into one end of each half lemon.<br>
 Push the ends of the lengths of bare copper wire into the other ends of each half lemon.<br>
 Remove the batteries from the clock and note the positive and negative terminals.<br>
 Clip a length of copper wire to the positive terminal of the clock.<br>
 Use a crocodile clip to connect the wire from half lemon A to the positive terminal of the clock.<br>
 Use a crocodile clip to connect the galvanized nail in wire half lemon B to the negative terminal of the clock.<br>
 Use a crocodile clip to join the galvanized nail in half lemon A to the wire in half lemon B.<br>
 Citric acid in the lemon juice electrolyte dissolves some zinc on the galvanized nail so the nail loses electrons and become positive.<br>
 The copper wire gains some of the electrons and become negative.<br>
 So a circuit is formed through the clock and the clock can go again.<br>
 10. Cut a lemon into four pieces.<br>
 Cut the peel in each piece and insert a "copper" coin half way in.<br>
 Insert a nail into the side of each piece.<br>
 Cut nine pieces of copper wire and use wire cutters to crimp two test clips to each end.<br>
 Connect the negative side of a 4V LED, (the flat edge on the bulb of the LED) to each of the coins with an alligator clip.<br>
 Attach a second wire to the nail of this slice and to the coin of another piece and so link all three of the four pieces.<br>
 Connect the last wire end to the nail of this slice and to the positive side of the LED light.<br>
 Observe light in the LED.<br>
 Electrons leave the coins so the charge on them becomes positive.<br>
 The nails receive the free electrons and so the charge on them becomes negative.<br>
 Electrons flow from negative to positive across the LED so it lights up.<br>
 Repeat the experiment using different coils as electrodes.<br>

 Experiment<br>
 1. Connect the external circuit before adding the sodium sulfate solution.<br>
 Clean copper in dilute nitric acid and clean magnesium ribbon in 1 M hydrochloric acid.<br>
 Half cells:<br>
 Magnesium ribbon is in contact with 0.5 M sodium sulfate solution, in a jar.<br>
 Copper strip is in contact with 0.5 M copper (II) sulfate solution, in a dialysis tubing bag, then in the same jar.<br>
 2. Fasten a short piece of metal to the end of the magnesium rod with the hose clamp, then wrap on foam insulation.<br>
 Use the handle of a screwdriver to loosely wrap around 10 turns of copper wire, then slip over the foam on the magnesium rod.<br>
 Wrap the assembly with foam insulation.<br>
 Immerse the assembly in water (with no added electrolyte), up to the top of the foam.<br>
 The battery produces about1.5 V and 20-100 mA continuously.<br>
 Each year, the magnesium rod and copper wire should be sanded to remove build-up.<br>
 Equations<br>
 Mg (s) --> Mg2+ (aq) + 2e- (Eo 2.36 V at 25 oC , 1 atmosphere pressure)<br>
 1/2 H2 --> H+ + 2e- (Eo = 0)<br>
 Cu (s) --> Cu2+ (aq) + 2e- (Eo = -0.337 V)<br>
 Mg (s) + Cu2+ (aq) --> Mg2+ (aq) + Cu (s)<br>
 EMF = Eo (oxidation) - Eo (reduction) so EMF = 2.36 - (-0.337) = 2.7 V<br>
 At the anode: Oxygen is liberated: 4OH- --> O2 + 2H2O + 4e-.<br>
 At the cathode: Hydrogen ions are not reduced to H2, because the Eo of reaction 2., where Eo = 0 V, is greater than the Eo of reaction 3.

Secondary cells, rechargeable batteries<br>
Secondary cells are rechargeable batteries, accumulators, e.g. lead cell accumulator motor vehicle battery, are voltaic cells which can be charged and 
discharged with an electric current.<br>
A secondary cell, accumulator, is a voltaic cell that can be recharged after discharged.<br>
However, they are large and heavy and contain a lot of dangerous liquid electrolyte, e.g. Ni-Cd storage batteries with potassium hydroxide electrolyte 
can be loaded again up to1000 times.<br>
In a circuit where ions conduct electricity, the positive and negative ions move at the same time as an ion electric current to positive or negative poles 
 acted on by the electric field force.<br>
A secondary battery is rechargeable, it can be discharged and later recharged, so it can be used many times, e.g. the lead cell accumulator motor vehicles.<br>

 +ve electrode: copper coated with carbon graphite<br>
 -ve electrode: aluminium coated with lithium-cobalt dioxide or other compounds<br>
 Electrolyte: Lithium salt, e.g. Lithium-phosphorus hexafluoride<br>
 Li-ion batteries have about twice the energy density of nickel batteries and they have no memory effect.<br>
 They must not be excessively overcharged or discharged.<br>
 They are used in laptop computers, and cell phones.<br>
 Lithium-ion batteries are very compact, low maintenance, low self-discharge, but must be charged with great care.<br>
 They are used for compact cell phones, notebook PCs, digital cameras, and any very small portable devices.<br>
 Lithium is the lightest metal and has the highest electrochemical potential, so it should provide a very high energy density.<br>
 However, it is highly reactive and could explode during recharging, so lithium compounds are used rather than lithium metal.<br>

 NiCad rechargeable batteries prefer deep cycling, good pulse capacity, but memory effect, high discharge rate.<br>
 Used in portable tools, appliances, model boats, data loggers, camcorders, portable transceivers, test equipment, electric toothbrushes, cordless power tools.<br>
 They have cost-effective energy storage and long working life.<br>
 During discharge:<br>

 At the anode (-ve): cadmium - 2 electrons --> cadmium (II) hydroxide (oxidation).<br>
 Recharging procedures<br>
 Nicads have a good flat discharge curve, but can potentially suffer from the "memory effect".<br>
 If consistently recharged before they are fully discharged, they "remember" the point of premature recharging and later runs down only to the capacity
 at last recharge.<br>
 The solution is to let the battery discharge almost completely before recharging, i.e. be deeply cycled.<br>
 Constant recharging after use for a short time may produce cause and change the form of cadmium crystals in the battery, causing lower electric release,
 lower voltage.<br>
 Nickel cadmium batteries can go through thousands of charging cycles.<br>
 Always follow local regulations when disposing of NiCad batteries, because they contain cadmium, an environmental pollutant.<br>
