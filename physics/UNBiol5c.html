<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.1.1H">5.1.1</a> World Health Organization report<br>
 "Every day, there are more than 1 million new cases of curable sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among people aged 15-49 years, according to data
 released today by WHO.<br>
 This amounts to more than 376 million new cases annually of four infections - chlamydia, gonorrhoea, trichomoniasis, and syphilis.<br>
 On average, approximately 1 in 25 people globally have at least one of these STIs, according to the latest figures, with some experiencing multiple
 infections at the same time.<br>
 STIs are preventable through safe sexual practices, including correct and consistent condom use and sexual health education." World Health Organization<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.1.2H">5.1.2</a> Health-seeking behaviours<br>
 1. Safer sexual intercourse means avoiding sexual contact where body fluids can pass into the body of another person.<br>
 Disease can be carried in all the body fluids, e.g. blood menstrual blood, semen, vaginal fluids, breast milk, amniotic fluid, pre-ejaculate.<br>
 The safest way to prevent body fluids passing between sexual partners is always to use a condom for all forms of sexual activity.<br>
 Condoms used with a water-based lubricant act as a barrier to prevent sexual fluids passing from one person to another.<br>
 However, anal sexual intercourse is always dangerous.<br>
 2. Never share injecting equipment, because needles, syringes, spoons, filters, water and glasses may have traces of blood in them that contain STIs.<br>
 Do not share personal toiletry items, e.g. toothbrushes, dental floss and razors, because they also may have traces of blood on them that contain STIs.<br>
 Always use disposable or properly sterilized needles for skin and body piercing or tattooing.<br>
 3. Avoid having many sexual partners.<br>
 Be true to one person.<br>
 The safest sexual choice is to have sexual intercourse with only one uninfected person, who has no other sexual partner and does not share injecting equipment.<br>
 4. Alcohol and other drugs impair judgment and can affect decisions about sexual behaviour, so avoid sexual intercourse while under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.<br>
 5. Both sexual partners should have healthy and clean bodies.<br>
 Many people use a shower with hot water and soap before sexual intercourse and wash thoroughly between the legs.<br>
 6. There are many alternatives to penetrative sex that allow partners to enjoy life together and not put the other partner at risk of STIs.<br>
 People can enjoy each other sexually by dancing, playing games, hugging, massage and other fun activities without passing body fluids between partners.<br>
 7. Prevent Infection and Spread of STDs<br>
 Use common sense and avoid sex with anyone who has genital sores, rashes, discharge, or other symptoms.<br>
 Get tested together with any new sexual partner.<br>
 All anyone has to do is enter their zip code and you can find somewhere near you to get tested.<br>
 Get tested for HIV and other commonly occurring, difficult to detect diseases.<br>
 HIV is a disease that is not commonly understood, as well as the process of getting tested for HIV.<br>
 Common conditions can be asymptomatic.<br>
 Although someone may have an STD they may show no symptoms of it.<br>
 So, getting tested regularly is important in making sure to get early treatment if one catches an STD.<br>
 If you think you have an STD:<br>
 Stop having sex.<br>
 Abstaining can be difficult if you are used to having sex on the regular, but if you think you have an STD this is the best way to prevent spreading it to others.<br>
 Seek medical treatment.<br>
 Do not try and play it off if you think you have an STD.<br>
 The best way to prevent getting an STD is to be safe and cautious.<br>
 Use condoms with partners.<br>
 Using condoms may seem like common sense prevention, but in the heat of the moment some people lose their head and forget to use common sense practice.<br>
 Make sure that your partners are aware and receiving treatment.<br>
 Do not let your emotions prevent you from being smart with your prevention practices.<br>
 Make sure that your partner is taking care of themselves so that you do not end up with an unwelcome surprise.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.1.3H">5.1.3</a> Contact tracing<br>
 1. Contact Tracing in Context<br>
 Contact tracing is the process of identifying the relevant contacts of a person with an infectious disease (index patient) and ensuring that they are aware of their exposure.<br>
 For sexually transmissible infections (STIs), relevant contacts include those with whom the index patient has had sex during the infectious period as well as babies of infected mothers.<br>
 For blood-borne infections such as HIV, hepatitis B and C, needle-sharing contacts and transfusion recipients, as well as those who may have been accidentally exposed to blood by other means, also need to be traced.<br>
 For pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), contact tracing will involve domestic or other close social contacts.<br>
 The term partner notification is often used interchangeably with contact tracing. but by definition excludes needle-sharing contacts, transfusion recipients and children born to infected women.<br>
 Some understand contact tracing as being synonymous with provider referral (where a health professional carries out tracing of contacts), while equating patient referral (where the patient does the notifying themselves) with partner notification.<br>
 In this manual, the term contact tracing is used in its broadest sense, encompassing both patient and provider referral.<br>
 Aims: The general aims of contact tracing are:<br>
 1. To interrupt the ongoing transmission of infection.<br>
 2. To identify people with an infection who may benefit from treatment in order to minimize the likelihood of complications of infection.<br>
 3. To prevent reinfection from an untreated partner to help limit the prevalence of infection in the population.<br>
 Reinfection (also called superinfection) usually refers to an HIV-positiveperson acquiring a second strain of virus from someone else with HIV.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.1.4H">5.1.4</a> Venereal disease"<br>
 STIs and "venereal disease", Sexually transmitted diseases (STIs) are infectious diseases that spread from person to person during intimate sexual contact,
 direct body contact or contact with infected body fluids.<br>
 A person can become infected through having vaginal, oral or anal sexual intercourse with an infected sexual partner.<br>
 An individual can become infected with more than one STI at the same time.<br>
 It is unlikely that STIs can be transmitted from objects unless the object has fresh and wet infected body fluid on it.<br>
 Toilet seats are a very unlikely source of infection.<br>
 Formerly, STIs were called "venereal diseases (VD)".<br>
 STIs usually infect the genitals, rectum, throat, and conjunctiva of the eye.<br>
 Several STIs spread from an initial site and produce sores in many parts of the body.<br>
 People with one sexually transmitted infection are usually at high risk for other diseases common in the same environment.<br>
 Many clients attending a clinic solely "for an AIDS test" are usually found to have one or more STIs although their AIDS test is usually negative.<br>
 However, the statistics on sex differences may not reflect the actual situation because infected women often do not show any symptoms and are more
 difficult to diagnose than men.<br>
 The fact that many infected women show no symptoms of STIs is especially unfortunate since the complications can be quite serious in pregnant women.<br>
 They may pass infections to the foetus during pregnancy or to the baby during childbirth.<br>
 Females who have an infection, such as genital Chlamydia, gonorrhoea, (NSGI), are at risk of inflammation of the uterus and Fallopian tubes, if specific
 infections are not diagnosed or treated early.<br>
 Symptoms may be lower abdominal pain, a vaginal discharge, pain during sex, or abnormal vaginal bleeding or spotting.<br>
 Commercial: Spotting plates</a> (Modern Teaching Aids)<br>
 One or more attacks of PID may damage the Fallopian tubes.<br>
 This damage can prevent fertilization from occurring, or if fertilization does occur, the growing fertilized egg may be unable to pass along to the uterus causing the egg to implant in the Fallopian tube.<br>
 This is called an ectopic pregnancy that is very serious and requires emergency medical care.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.1.5H">5.1.5</a> Treatment<br>
 Treatment of STIs, (STDs) involves medical treatment, counselling, and follow up.<br>
 The doctor or health worker should always explain the disease and its treatment to the patient.<br>
 A person may remain infected when symptoms disappear, or may become reinfected immediately after treatment, so a follow up visit is important.<br>
 The infected person should not have sexual intercourse until the follow up visit has confirmed the cure of the disease.<br>
 Sexual partners of people with STI infection should also seek medical examinationto avoid "ping-pong infection", i.e. passing disease back and forth between two sexual partners.<br>
 People who learn they are infected with STIs can fell guilty, depressed, anxious or angry, so they should discuss their feelings with a doctor, a counsellor or others who have the same problem.<br>
 The notifiable diseases (reportable diseases) that must be reported to governmental authorities by doctors may include Gonorrhoea, Syphilis, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and Chlamydia trachomatis.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.2.15H">5.2.15</a> Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)<br>
 Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)<br>
 <a href="#5.2.15.1H">See 5.2.15.1</a>: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) contact tracing, (Chlamydia trachomatis), (Neisseria gonorrhoeae), (Mycoplasma genitalium)<br>
 In some countries, many people are infected with Chlamydia, but they are unaware of the infection.<br>
 They do not see or feel anything wrong so they can unknowingly pass on Chlamydia to their sexual partners if they are not using condoms.<br>
 Chlamydia can also be passed on by oral or anal sex.<br>
 Females may have symptoms of a burning sensation when passing urine, an unusual vaginal discharge, itch or irritation, lower abdominal pain, pain during sexual intercourse, abnormal bleeding or spotting between periods.<br>
 Males may have symptoms of a clear whitish or yellow discharge from the penis, burning or pain on passing urine, irritation or itching around the urethra, pain in the rectum or testicles, pain with ejaculation.<br>
 Chlamydia may cause pelvic inflammatory disease, PID, in women if left untreated.<br>
 A pregnant woman with a Chlamydia infection has an increased risk of having a stillborn or premature baby.<br>
 Chlamydia infection can make them infertile.<br>
 Laboratory tests can identify Chlamydia and the infection is easily treated with antibiotics.<br>
 The prescribed treatment must be completed.<br>
 Otherwise, the infection will not be cured.<br>
 The sexual partners should also get tested and treated.<br>
 Patients should not have sexual intercourse while they and the sexual partner are taking the treatment, as they could reinfect each other.<br>
 Chlamydia may cause infertility due to salpingitis, infection and inflammation in the Fallopian tubes.<br>
 Chlamydia infects the cervix in women, and the penile urethra in men.<br>
 According to a 2010 study by the CDC, Chlamydia is the most common STD among persons under the age of 25.<br>
 In Australia, the Queensland State Government reported in 2013 on the rapid and steady increase in annual notifications of Chlamydia rising 90 per cent between 2004 and 2009.<br>
 Symptoms: Pain during sex, and discharge from the penis or vagina.<br>
 Chlamydia is difficult to diagnose, because it can be carried for several months without symptoms.<br>
 That incubation period has helped lead to an increased rate of infection.<br>
 Treatment: The use of antibiotics Dexacycline and Tetracycline for seven days and persons with Chlamydia should abstain from having sex during the course of treatment.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.2.10H">5.2.10</a> Gonorrhoea<br>
 Gonorrhoea, urethral / vaginal discharge, "the clap"<br>
 <a href="#5.1.5H">See 5.1.5</a>: Gonorrhoea contact tracing, Neisseria gonorrhoeae<br>
 Gonorrhoea is caused by the gonococcus bacterium (Neisseria gonorrhoeae).<br>
 People get infected by having sexual intercourse without a condom, oral sex, or touching infected genitals or anus.<br>
 After infection they may have no symptoms until 2-10 days after infection.<br>
 Symptoms include a cream yellow discharge from the penis or vagina, pain on intercourse, sore throat if infected in the throat, anus itch, if infected in the anus.<br>
 Even if the symptoms clear up, the infection may still be there and cause problems later.<br>
 Treat the disease with antibiotics.<br>
 Untreated gonorrhoea can cause the following:<br>
 1. Ulcers that increase the risk of infection by HIV, 2. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), 3. Infertility of women, 4. Infection in the eyes of the baby. 5. Infertility due to salpingitis, inflammation of the Fallopian tubes.<br>
 All the sexual partners of a person infected with gonorrhoea should be checked by a doctor.<br>
 Gonorrhoea, or "the Clap", is a bacterial STD that is very common among sexually active teens and young adults.<br>
 Gonorrhoea is often found with Chlamydia.<br>
 There are more than 700, 000 new cases a year in the US.<br>
 Condoms are a great preventive measure.<br>
 Be aware that, because this is a bacterial infections oral transmission is possible, often resulting in gonorrhoea of the throat.<br>
 Symptoms: "The Clap" is commonly recognizable by burning during urination.<br>
 For men, there is also a common penile discharge usually coloured white or yellow, but can sometimes come through green discharge.<br>
 Treatment: CDC recommends that uncomplicated gonorrhoea be treated only with the antibiotic ceftriaxone given as an injection and in combination with either azithromycin or doxycycline both of which are oral antibiotics.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.2.13H">5.2.13</a> Non-specific urethritis (NSU)<br>
 Non-specific urethritis (NSU), non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU), non-specific genital infection (NSGI)<br>
 Non-specific urethritis (NSU) is a common infection among young sexually active people who have sexual intercourse without using a condom.<br>
 Many people do not have any symptoms.<br>
 In males it is called non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) or non-specific urethritis (NSU) or non-specific genital infection (NSGI).<br>
 Urethritis is an inflammation of the urethra.<br>
 The symptoms are a watery, white discharge from the urethra in the penis or pain on passing urine.<br>
 In females, NSGI is often cervicitis, inflammation of the cervix.<br>
 The symptoms are lower abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, pain on sexual intercourse or a burning sensation on passing urine.<br>
 People with these symptoms should be tested for STI infection.<br>
 The most common cause is Chlamydia trachomatis, although often the specific organism causing the symptoms cannot be identified.<br>
 Non-gonococcal urethritis is caused by a primitive bacterium, a mycoplasma.<br>
 Antibiotic treatment cures these infections.<br>
 Sexual partners of patients should be tested and treated whether or not they appear to have symptoms.<br>
 Sexual intercourse should be avoided until the treatment is complete.<br>
 If NSGI infections are not treated without delay, there is a danger in females of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) damaged Fallopian tubes and infertility.<br>
 In males, there is danger of prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate gland), epididymitis (inflammation of the epididymis), and infertility.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.2.14H">5.2.14</a> Pediculosis<br>
 <a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/environment/headlice/pages/treatment.aspx#bookmark2">Head Lice</a>, Healthe, NSW<br>
 Pediculosis, lice, louse, (Phthirus pubis)<br>
 Pediculosis or louse infestation is caused by the arthropod pubic louse, "crabs", crab louse, (Phthirus pubis).<br>
 The louse attaches to coarse body hair and causes irritation, redness and dermatitis.<br>
 Lice usually spread by close body contact, sharing combs and rarely by contact with unwashed bed linen or towels.<br>
 Treatment is by DDT powder or lotions or γ-benzene hexachloride to kill the lice and eggs.<br>
 Pubic lice move from person to person by close contact, often during sex.<br>
 They can be infected by pubic lice from sharing soiled clothes, bed sheets, or towels.<br>
 Other kinds of lice, the head louse, (Pediculus humanus capitus), and the body louse, (Pediculus humanus corporis), can be quite common in schools.<br>
 If infestation occurs, all the children in the school should be treated.<br>
 The eggs of lice, "nits", become attached to hairs. but may be removed with a special fine comb, "nit comb".<br>
 Trench fever, relapsing fever, that affects soldiers confined in warfare trenches, is transmitted by the faeces of lice.<br>
 Day 0 Egg laid on hair shaft, Day 6 -7 Louse hatches, Day 8-9 First moult, Day 11-12 Second moult, Day 17-18 Adult lice mate and female lays first eggs 1-2 days after mating<br>
 Day 19-32 Females lay 3-8 eggs each day for the next 16 days, Day 33-35 Louse dies.<br>
 "Crabs" was once the most common STD in existence, but have in recent years become one of the least seen infections.<br>
 This may be because those who are sexually active are choosing to shave off their pubic hair for an increase in pleasure during sex activity.<br>
 The "crabs", which are a distant relative of head lice, need to be treated as soon as possible.<br>
 Safe sex with condoms can help prevent the spread, but will likely do very little since crabs is based in the sharing of the lice across pubic regions, and not external sexual genitalia.<br>
 Symptoms: Itching in the pubic area.<br>
 Small lice appear in the hair of the pubic region, with small eggs implanted just beneath the skin.<br>
 Treatment: A pharmacist can suggest a lice-killing lotion containing 1% permethrin or a mousse containing pyrethrins and piperonyl butoxide can be used to treat 
 pubic (crab) lice.<br>
 Lindane shampoo is also effective for those with repeat outbreaks.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.2.16H">5.2.16</a> Scabies<br>
 Scabies is caused by the itch mite, (Sarcoptes scabiei), "crabs", or "sandy crabs".<br>
 It burrows into the skin often between the fingers and on the wrists and causes intense itching that is worse at night.<br>
 The entrances to the burrows have small scale-like swellings that become red and itchy.<br>
 Transmission is by close body contact during sexual intercourse and sharing clothes and bed linen with an infected person.<br>
 Treat it with a benzyl benzoate lotion applied externally to kill the mites and eggs.<br>
 Also, prescription strength | permethrin, C21H20Cl2O3, C21Cl2H20O3 | kills the scabies mite.<br>
 Wash all bedding and clothes used by the infected person.<br>
 Not always classified as an STD, the parasite Sarcoptes scabei, causes an extremely itchy rash that gets worse at night.<br>
 Scabies is most commonly found in folds of the skin, on the wrists and ankles, and in the genital area.<br>
 Symptoms: Scabies is incredibly contagious, and the mite can live for days off the human body.<br>
 It is not only spread by close personal contact, but by skin-to-skin contact in general, shared clothing, towels and bedding.<br>
 There is often plenty of scratching and red marks around the arms.<br>
 Treatment: Permethrin and Ivermectin the most effective treatment for scabies and the treatment of choice.<br>
 It is applied from the neck down usually before bedtime and left on for about eight to fourteen hours, then showered off in the morning.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.2.17H">5.2.17</a> Syphilis<br>
 <a href="#11.1.11H">11.1.11</a> Syphilis contact tracing, (Treponema pallidum)<br>
 Syphilis is caused by the bacterium, (Treponema pallidum).<br>
 The infection causes a painless sore on the mouth or genitals that disappears after two weeks.<br>
 The sore feels like a button under the skin.<br>
 Treat the infection with antibiotics, e.g. penicillin.<br>
 Months after infection symptoms include a skin rash, patchy loss of hair, moist lumps around the genitals or anus.<br>
 If not treated, these symptoms may disappear and then recur over the next two years.<br>
 An untreated person may infect sexual partners during sexual intercourse.<br>
 Without treatment, the disease may become latent with. but reappear years later with fatal consequences due to infection of the brain, heart,
 large blood vessels, the spinal cord, skin and bones.<br>
 People infected with syphilis are infectious and should avoid all sexual contact until advised by a doctor.<br>
 A pregnant woman who has syphilis can pass it on to her unborn baby that may be born dead or badly damaged as a consequence.<br>
 The bacteria that causes syphilis, (Treponema pallidum) can become a very serious battle for your body if left untreated.<br>
 Syphilis is transmitted by syphilis sores, which can appear on the external genitals mouth, the vagina and rectum.<br>
 Be sure to check your partner before going into direct physical contact.<br>
 Because the sores are not only on the genitalia, the condom use that prevents most STDs will only reduce your risk.<br>
 Symptoms: Lesions on the palms and the tops of the hands, and later several red bumps running along the back.<br>
 Treatment: For uncomplicated a single dose of intramuscular penicillin G or oral azithromycin does the task.<br>
 Those who are seeking later treatment will need ten days of heavy IV penicillin.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.2.18H">5.2.18</a> Trichomoniasis<br>
 <a href="#5.1.12H">See 5.1.12</a>: Trichomonas vaginalis contact tracing<br>
 Trichomoniasis is caused by the flagellated protozoan (Trichomonas vaginalis).<br>
 It causes an unpleasant discharge and irritation of the vagina and painful urination.<br>
 Treat the infection with antibiotics.<br>
 It is mainly spread by sexual intercourse.<br>
 The infection poses no great threat to health. but it often occurs along with other STIs, e.g. gonorrhoea.<br>
 Women with trichomoniasis infection may become more easily infected with AIDS.<br>
 So an infected person should be checked for other STI infections.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.2.1H">5.2.1</a> Bacterial vaginosis, (Gardnerella vaginalis)<br>
 Bacterial vaginosis, (Gardnerella vaginalis) is probably NOT an STI, because women who are not sexually active, or have never been sexually active,
 can be infected.<br>
 Women develop bacterial vaginosis soon after intercourse with a new sexual partner.<br>
 Bacterial vaginosis is an overgrowth of various bacteria that are normally present in the vagina.<br>
 Gardnerella is one bacterium that may be involved so sometimes the condition is called "Gardnerella".<br>
 The reason this change in the vaginal bacteria occurs is not known.<br>
 It is not a serious disease and may require treatment only if symptoms cause distress or inconvenience.<br>
 Symptoms are irritation and vaginal discharge with an unpleasant odour.<br>
 To prevent Gardnerella, wipe from the front to the back, from vaginal area to the anus after going to the toilet, not from anus to vaginal area.<br>
 Keep wiping until the toilet paper is clean or wash the area.<br>
 The treatment is usually | metronidazole, C6H9N3O3 | tablets, "Flagyl".<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.2.2H">5.2.2</a> Candidiasis (Thrush)<br>
Candidiasis, thrush, is caused by the fungus, (Candida albicans), a yeast that normally occurs in the mouth, vagina and intestines without causing
 any symptoms.<br>
 It is not an STI, but sexual intercourse may irritate the vagina and allow Candida albicans to grow.<br>
 It causes itchy white vaginal discharge with a yeasty smell, swelling and redness of the vagina, discomfort during intercourse, and stinging when
 passing urine.<br>
 Repeated attacks may cause women to feel depressed and lose interest in sexual intercourse.<br>
 Thrush is more likely to occur during pregnancy, by taking the contraceptive pill after taking antibiotics that kill normal bacteria, during the week before
 and after the period of the menstrual cycle, and, because of diabetes when the immune system is suppressed.<br>
 When symptoms are noticed, the woman should see a doctor to have a swab taken for testing whether it is (Candida albicans) or another infection.<br>
 Doctors usually prescribe vaginal cream or pessaries.<br>
 It is important to complete the course of treatment.<br>
 The same cream should be applied to the penis under the foreskin.<br>
 Women patients should wear cotton underpants or loose flowing skirts.<br>
 They should not wear nylon pants, pantyhose or tight jeans.<br>
 Eating natural yoghurt with the course of antibiotics may help the bacteria in the intestines return to normal when possible.<br>
 To avoid infection, after toilet wipe from front to back with toilet paper to prevent risk of bowel bacteria contaminating the vaginal area.<br>
 After washing, women should gently wipe the vulva area dry.<br>
 Most soaps are alkaline and can neutralize the natural acidity of the body so it is better to wash with water only in that area.<br>
 Avoid using heavily perfumed soaps or sprays in the genital area, as they may cause irritation.<br>
 Thrush can be spread by sexual contact.<br>
 Men may also be affected, but usually less severely and do not necessarily require treatment.<br>
 The symptoms for men are red spots on the penis, scrotum or groin.<br>
 Occasionally, (Candida albicans) may live under the foreskin of an uncircumcised male, but he might be unaware of it if no discomfort occurs.<br>
 To avoid thrush, uncircumcised men should wash under the foreskin daily.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.2.5H">5.2.5</a> Cystitis<br>
 Cystitis, "honeymoon disease", (Escherichia coli) causes inflammation of the urethra (urethritis) and bladder (cystitis).<br>
 Cystitis is probably not an STI, because it is probably caused by poor toilet hygiene before sexual intercourse.<br>
 It formerly was called the "honeymooner's disease".<br>
 Cystitis is an inflammation of the bladder caused by an infection of the urinary tract by bacteria that normally live in the bowel.<br>
 Symptoms: scalding feeling when passing urine (dysuria) a desire to pass urine frequently, a persistent dull ache above the pelvic bone after passing urine.<br>
 Untreated cystitis can cause serious kidney infection.<br>
 Prevention includes better toilet hygiene as with Gardnerella, drinking large quantities of water, washing the vulva with soft soap, wearing cotton
 underpants and avoiding tight jeans.<br>
 If cystitis is suspected, see a doctor who will prescribe antibiotics and perhaps conduct a pelvic examination to ensure the vagina is healthy.<br>
 STIs also cause infection of the urethra.<br>
 People who learn they have cystitis can feel embarrassed, depressed and anxious.<br>
 Cranberry juice is said to help deal with this disease.<br>
 Untreated cystitis can result in inflammation in the kidneys, pyelitis, and pylonephritis leading to blood cells and pus in the urine.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.2.9H">5.2.9</a> Genital growths<br>
 Genital growths: Balanitis, Molluscum contagiosum<br>
 Balanitis is inflammation, redness and soreness, of the head of the penis.<br>
 It is not an STI. but sexual intercourse may irritate the head of the penis and lead to balanitis.<br>
 Men with foreskins are more likely to get this condition.<br>
 Treat the symptoms by keeping the head of the penis and the foreskin cleanand dry.<br>
 Sexual partners do not require treatment.<br>
 Molluscum contagiosum is a virus skin infection and appears on the genitals and adjacent areas as round, pearly lumps with a central white core.<br>
 It is a harmless condition and is treated by freezing with carbon dioxide.<br>
 It spreads by sexual and non-sexual contact.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.2.7H">5.2.7</a> Endometriosis<br>
 Endometriosis can lead to infertility, and occurs when cells lining the uterus begin to grow elsewhere, e.g. on the ovaries, fallopian tubes, bladder
 and bowel.<br>
 Research has identified two regions of DNA close to gene WNT4, strongly associated with this disorder and this may lead to a diagnostic test for
 this painful gynaecological condition.<br>
 Environment factors may also be important for the development of this disease.<br>
 At present, 2024, there is no known way to prevent endometriosis.<br> 
 Currently there is no cure.<br>
 A range of medications can help manage endometriosis and its symptoms.
 Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and analgesics (painkillers) like ibuprofen and naproxen are often used to treat pain.

 Tuberculosis (TB) is a lower respiratory tract infection caused by (Mycobacterium tuberculosis), which infects the lungs.<br> 
 It remains a major killer because of a rise in drug-resistant strains.<br> 
 Tuberculosis (TB) is a communicable disease acquired when a person inhales the bacterium in droplets coughed out by someone with infectious pulmonary TB.<br>
 It is not transmitted sexually or via blood transmission.<br>
 Incubation period: Exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis may result in Latent TB Infection (LTBI), but not active TB disease.<br>
 TB disease may occur months to years after infection or may never appear.<br>
 People with extrapulmonary TB are rarely infectious.<br>
 People with LTBI infection are not infectious.<br>
 The Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) is the primary method for diagnosis of LTBI worldwide.<br>
 However, the specificity of the TST for the diagnosis of LTBI is adversely affected by BCG vaccination and cross- reaction with non-tuberculous mycobacteria.<br>
 Symptoms of pulmonary TB may include a cough that lasts for more than 3 weeks, pleuritic chest pain, haemoptysis, fever, night sweats and weight loss.<br>
 Ziehl-Neelsen stain (acid-fast stain) stains bright red mainly Mycobacteria, e.g. Mycobacterium tuberculosis that causes tuberculosis (TB).
 The vaccine against TB is one of the most widely used worldwide.<br>
 Pasteurization destroys all pathogenic organisms, e.g. tuberculosis and most other bacteria to reducing the risk of milk borne infection and delay milk becoming sour.<br>
 Rifampin, Rifampicin, C43H58N4O12, macrocyclic antibiotic, broad antibacterial activity against mycobacteria, prescription drug for treating tuberculosis<br> 
 A person with not enough T-helper cells to respond to infection will become ill and develop AIDS.
 The infected person loses resistance to diseases and may die of opportunistic infections or AIDS-related illnesses, e.g. tuberculosis or bronchitis.

 The herpes simplex virus can cause "cold sores" if the mouth is infected or genital ulcers if the sexual organs are infected.<br>
 The symptoms include clusters of small painful blisters that become ulcers then in two weeks.<br>
 People infected with the herpes virus may never develop any symptoms and so remain unaware of the infection.<br>
 The first infection of genital herpes has usually the worst symptoms.<br>
 The symptoms may recur when people are tired or tense or never recur.<br>
 If a person has genital herpes, the virus in specific nerve cells can pass on by sexual contact, even if the infected person does not have herpes blisters or ulcers.<br>
 There is no cure for herpes. but it can be managed to ease the symptoms by bathing the sores in saltwater.<br>

 A viral STD, herpes, in two common strains, HSV1 and HSV2. HSV1 is the herpes cold sore virus, a variety that is common to see around the mouth,
 HSV2 is most often associated with genital sores.<br>
 Symptoms: Collection of small white bumps clumped on the external genitalia, or in the pubic region.<br>
 Single large puss-like pustules may form along with scabbing over of the infected area.<br>
 Treatment: Herpes is treated with antiviral drugs, but the virus cannot be cured.<br>
 People with the herpes virus need to know that they can transmit the virus even when they do not have any sores or other symptoms.<br>
 The virus lives in the nerve endings, so a reduction in stress and intense rubbing will prevent further outbreaks, and sleep is also a powerful treatment.<br>
 HSV-1 (Herpes simplex 1)<br>
 HSV-1, herpes simplex virus causes cold sores, painful blemishes of the mouth (fever blisters).<br>
 It can become dormant for years, when drugs cannot affect it<br>

 Hepatitis B, yellowish skin, tiredness, dark urine, abdominal pain<br>
 <a href="#5.1.7H">See 5.1.7</a>: Hepatitis B contact tracing, Hepatitis B virus<br>
 This disease is caused by is a virus that affects the liver.<br>
 The virus is spread by blood to blood contact, e.g. sharing needles, or by sexual intercourse, vaginal, oral or anal.<br>
 People who are infected may have no symptoms at all or they may become ill with fever, nausea, dark urine or jaundice, yellow skin and eyes.<br>
 After infection, most adults recover, develop antibodies to the virus and cannot spread the virus to others.<br>
 A few people retain the virus, become carriers, may infect other people, and have an increased risk of developing liver disease.<br>
 A vaccine for Hepatitis B is available.<br>
 It is not effective for Hepatitis B carriers.<br>

 This disease is caused by another virus that affects the liver.<br>
 At this stage, there is no test to show whether a person has completely cleared the virus from the body or if the person remains a carrier and can infect others.<br>
 It is suspected that more people remain carriers than with Hepatitis B disease, long-term carriers may develop liver problems years after infection.<br>
 Hepatitis C is spread by blood to blood contact.<br>
 It does not appear to spread easily by sexual contact.<br>
 Currently, it would appear that many patients with Hepatitis C have been infected by sharing needles or other drug using equipment or by infected blood
 transfusions.<br>
 In some countries, blood is routinely screened for Hepatitis C before transfusion.<br>
 In 2006 there is no vaccine available for Hepatitis C disease.<br>
 People with Hepatitis C disease should be checked by a doctor every few years.<br>
 Significant advances have recently, 2013, been made in the management of hepatitis C virus (HCV).<br>
 These advances include the use of non-invasive methods to assess liver fibrosis, interleukin 28B genotype testing to predict interferon responsiveness
 and the use of new antiviral regimens for HCVgenotype I, using antiviral agents (boceprevir and telaprevir).<br>
 These protease inhibitors are used in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin as triple therapy for genotype I HCV.<br>
 The protease inhibitors are the first of many antiviral drugs to become available to treat HCV, heralding the arrival of new agents that will offer greater chances of cure with improved safety and tolerability
 compared with current therapies.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.8.1H">9.8.1</a> Human immunodeficiency virus, (HIV)<br>
 HIV (Human immunodeficiency virus) AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome)	Opportunistic infections
 Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, AIDS<br>
 The acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, AIDS, is a range of medical conditions,
 It is a syndrome, that occurs when a person's immune system is seriously weakened by infection from the human immunodeficiency virus, HIV.<br>
 So there is no such thing as an "AIDS virus".<br>
 HIV is called a retrovirus, because it can change its own RNA genetic material into DNA to cause the host cell's DNA to produce more HIV.<br>
 Blood contains three types of cells, erythrocytes, thrombocytes, and leucocytes.<br>
 Leucocytes, white blood cells, are responsible for the defence of the body against disease.<br>
 One type of white cell, the T-lymphocyte, T-helper cell, is essential for immunity, because it recognizes foreign antigens from its memory of previous infections and alerts other white cells to destroy the foreign 
 antigen.<br>
 HIV attacks the T-helper cells, reproduces inside them and kills them, causing a gradual deterioration of immune functions following the initial HIV infection.<br>
 A person with not enough T-helper cells to respond to infection will become ill and develop AIDS.<br>
 The infected person loses resistance to diseases and may die of opportunistic infections or AIDS-related illnesses, e.g. tuberculosis or bronchitis.<br>
 The opportunistic infections that occur in a person infected with HIV are caused first by destruction of immune defences by the virus and secondly by infections in your everyday environment.<br>
 These infections can often be treated, but there is no successful treatment for the immune deficiency caused by the virus.<br>
<br> 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.8.2H">9.8.2</a> Causes of infection by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)<br>
 HIV is the virus that causes AIDS, and is transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids; semen, vaginal secretions, breast milk and blood.<br>
 Infection can occur from any activity that allows body fluids infected with HIV to enter the bloodstream through a break in the skin, e.g. a cut or open sore.<br>
 Body fluids include blood, menstrual blood, bleeding gums, semen, vaginal secretions, breast milk, amniotic fluid, and pre-ejaculate.<br>
 Infection can occur in the following circumstances:<br>
 1. Unprotected sexual contact with an infected person, i.e. sexual intercourse without using a condom.<br>
 The virus can enter the body through the lining mucosa of the vagina, penis and rectum, especially if these linings are already damaged by STIs that cause ulcers or inflammation.<br>
 2. Using needles and / or syringes drug injections contaminated with minute quantities of blood containing the virus.<br>
 3. Transfusion of infected blood or blood clotting factors.<br>
 This should not occur when blood is properly screened in hospitals for HIV antibodies.<br>
 4. Babies being born to HIV-infected mothers becoming infected before or during birth or through breast feeding.<br>
 5. Cutting the skin without sterilizing between persons, e.g. tattooing, piercing, circumcision, female genital cutting.<br>
 There is no scientific evidence to support transmission of AIDS by mosquitoes, shaking hands, drinking from the same glass, sharing clothes, sitting on toilet seats, swimming, hugging, or looking after AIDS-positive
 adults or children living with AIDS.<br>
<br> 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.8.3H">9.8.3</a> Description of infection by HIV<br>
 After infecting a new host, HIV starts rapidly reproducing itself inside the host's cells to produce new viruses that infect additional cells.<br>
 The viral replication may be so intensive that within a month after infection the infected individuals may have 100 million viral copies per mL of blood plasma.<br>
 The first line of natural immune defence is the non-specific immune system consisting of cells that patrol the body to destroy any virus-infected cell they encounter.<br>
 However, in most HIV-infected individuals the non-specific immune system may be overwhelmed by the initial onslaught of replicating HIV.<br>
 However, antigen presenting cells of the non-specific immune system engulf some viral proteins so that they can later show them to more specialized immune system components with the aim of producing a specify response to the HIV.<br>
 The antigen presenting cells include the helper T cells and killer T cells.<br>
 When the killer Y cells have received a description of the infecting virus intruder and a chemical signal from helper T cells, they multiply, then start destroying the infecting virus approximately three weeks after the initial infection.<br>
 The killer T cells do destroy most virus-infected cells and drive down the virus levels.<br>
 However, usually the response is not enough to prevent lifelong chronic infection.<br>
 The helper T cells direct the activities of other immune cells, but from the start of the infection, the HIV infects helper T cells themselves to replicate inside them and destroying them.<br>
 The HIV destroys the "memory helper" T cells that hold the immune system's memory of past exposures to pathogens.<br>
 A few weeks after the initial infection, so many memory helper T cells are destroyed that the control of the immune system is destroyed and never fully recovers.<br>
 Meanwhile, the HIV has a method of evading the killer T cells.<br>
 After entering a cell, the HIV copies its RNA genetic material into DNA in an inexact procedure that result in mutations in the viral copy.<br>
 These mutations are passed to the next generation every time the next generation of viruses copy themselves.<br>
 Also, if two viruses infect the same cell, they can swap genetic material by recombination and produce another virus variant for the next generation.<br>
 The increasing genetic diversity of HIV proteins causes them to become increasingly unrecognizable to immune cells that can only remember the original version of the virus.<br>
 As the killer T cells destroy all the cells displaying recognizable antigens, the virus-infected cells carrying mutant proteins take over.<br>
 Similarly, the antibodies produced by the immune system, weeks after the initial infection cannot recognize many of the HIV proteins in the host later in the infection.<br>
 Immune defences are usually unable to recognize variant versions of HIV.<br>
 So even a strong vaccine-evoked memory response against one strain of HIV might be ineffective against the strain that later enters the body or might become useless as the virus mutates.<br>
 HIV mutates so rapidly that the diversity of proteins on the surface of HIV particles in a single person after six years of infection is estimated to be greater than the diversity of all the human flu viruses strains world wide in a given year.<br>
<br> 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.8.4H">9.8.4</a> Diagnosis of HIV/AIDS<br>
 You cannot tell just by looking if someone is infected with HIV, because some HIV positive people can stay healthy and look healthy for many years.<br>
 A person who has the HIV infection has antibodies in the blood to the virus but may not have developed any of the illnesses of AIDS.<br>
 The only sure way of knowing is to get tested with the ELISA blood tests then confirm the result with the Western blot blood tests.<br>
 Also, saliva tests are used.<br>
 Voluntary testing for HIV before marriage is recommended.<br>
 Antibodies are proteins that attack and remove any foreign organisms and toxins, antigens, in the blood.<br>
 HIV is an antigen.<br>
 The antibodies produced by HIV infection cannot get rid of it. but the existence of "marker" antibodies show that HIV infection has occurred.<br>
 Receiving pre-test and post-test counselling is important.<br>
 People may be infected without knowing it and transmit HIV to others during this time.<br>
 However, the tests that identify the antibodies to HIV usually give a negative result for the first one to three months after initial infection, 
 called the "window period".<br>
 So a person who has been at risk of recent infection who receives a negative test result should get a repeat of the test after three to four months.<br>
 Counselling should be given before and after the tests to ensure that the patient understands the implications of either a positive or negative result.<br>
 The doctor should give the test results face-to-face and ensure that all information about the test remains confidential.<br>
<br> 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.8.5H">9.8.5</a> Symptoms of HIV/AIDS<br>
 Symptoms include fever, fatigue and flu-like symptoms.<br>
 Weight loss and skin rashes along with pneumonia are also common symptoms.<br>
 As the virus continues to attack the immune system, a person will develop symptoms of the disease, e.g. persistent fatigue, swollen lymph glands, rapid weight loss, night sweats, memory loss, persistent diarrhoea.<br>
 When the immune system is severely damaged, certain cancers, infections 
 and brain disorders can occur.<br>
 For example, the appearance of purple blotches on the skin may indicate 
 Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS).<br>
 This stage of the illness is called AIDS.<br>
<br> 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.8.6H">9.8.6</a> Treatment of HIV/AIDS<br>
 In 2022, HIV infection can be treated. but not cured, because the body cannot rid of it.<br>
However, there are many medications, called antiretroviral therapy (ART), that can control HIV and prevent complications.<br>
 There are three types of treatment that can be very effective if early 
diagnosis occurs:<br>
 1. Antiretroviral medication is used to slow the reproduction of the virus
but not cure AIDS.<br>
 There is no such thing as an "AIDS vaccine".<br>
 HIV targets the immune system and it is a retrovirus that can insert itself
into the genetic material, replicate quickly and often mutate.<br>
 The first anti-HIV drug, AZT, was licensed in 1987.<br>
 It inhibits the HIV enzyme reverse transcripts that the virus uses to convert its single strand of RNA into double strand DNA before splicing itself into the genome of the host cell.<br>
 However, the high rate of mutation by the HIV virus allowed resistance to the drug to develop.<br>
 So medical researchers developed many other "antiretroviral" drugs to be taken in different combinations, e.g. Lamivudine, Viread and Ziagen.<br>
 Other types of anti-HIV drugs are the following:<br>
 1.1 Fusion inhibitors (entry inhibitors), e.g. Enfuvirtide, that interferes with the HIV ability to enter cells.<br>
 1.2 Integrase inhibitors, e.g. Raltegravir, that block the enzyme integrase that the HIV virus uses to integrate its genetic material into the host cell's DNA.<br>
 1.3 Maturation inhibitors, e.g. Bevirimat, that block replication of the HIV virus.<br>
 HIV positive patients living in countries where these drugs are available and who have a healthy lifestyle and can afford the treatment have lived an almost normal lifestyle for over 15 years since the initial infection.<br>
 2. The opportunistic infections and AIDS-related illnesses can be treated with medications.<br>
 3. AIDS is a life threatening illness. but people with HIV can improve their lifestyle to help them live healthy lives for many years.<br>
 AIDS is more likely to be appear when the person suffers from other infections, drug and alcohol abuse, poor nutrition, and stress.<br>
 All the medications must be taken together and consistently.<br>
 Current drug regimens can suppress HIV. but no treatments can completely eliminate the virus from the patient's body, because places where the virus can hide are still being discovered.<br>
 4. Most people with HIV are treated with a combination of drugs known as highly active antiretroviral therapy, or HAART.<br>
 These can include NRTIs (Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors) which are the drug cocktails that many people refer to when thinking of HIV.<br>
 5. In South Africa, the pre-exposure prophylaxis tablet PrEP, "Truvada", is prescribed for HIV negative patients exposed to the virus, e.g. female students between 15 and 24 and commercial sex workers.<br>
 The tablet contains two antiretriviral drugs, tenofovir and emtricitabine.<br>
 It does not prevent other sexually transmitted diseases or pregnancy.<br>
 PrEP may have the side effect of kidney dysfunction and minor gastro-intestinal problems.<br>
<br> 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.8.7H">9.8.7</a> The effects of HIV/AIDS<br>
 The effects include loss of fathers or mothers, economic loss, extra burden on medical facilities, accepting HIV positive people in the community.<br>
 HIV/AIDS, loneliness may be more fearsome than the illness itself, and few think they can bear being abandoned by their family and society.<br>
 However, people are showing concern and health workers should be ready to give them medical and psychological care.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.9.0H">9.9.0</a> Common warts<br>
Warts are usually harmless uskin growths, which look like thickened skin, feel rogh to touch and are usually round or oval shaped.<br> 
Warts are caused by the human papillomavirus that enters the skin through scratches or other skin damage.<br>
Warts are common in school-age children.<br>
Usually there are only 1 or 2 warts on a person, but sometimes there can be a lot in one area.<br>
Warts can spread to other people, usually from skin-to-skin contact with another person.<br> 
Picking or scratching warts can mean the warts are spread to other parts of the infected person’s body.<br>
Warts can also be spread by touching contaminated surfaces.<br>
Parents should try to stop the child picking or scratching the warts, and make sure the child washes their hands thoroughly and often.<br>
Treatment for common warts includes:<br>
Commercial anti-wart medicines containing salicylic acid.<br>
Cryotherapy which causes a blister to form under and around the wart, killing the tissue so it off in a week or so,<br>
A healthcare professional can use a curet to cut out the wart.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.9.1H">9.9.1</a> Genital warts<br>
 Genital warts are caused by the Human Papilloma Virus, HPV.<br>
 Genital warts are very common in sexually active people with many sexual partners. but the warts may not be visible, e.g. warts on the cervix.<br>
 People who see or feel unusual lumps on the genitals should see a doctor.<br>
 Treat with paints, freezing or burning.<br>
 Repeat treatments are usually necessary.<br>
 Different strains of the wart virus affect different parts of the body.<br>
 Genital warts are different from warts seen on the hands and knees.<br>
 Genital warts are probably spread by sexual contact. but may not appear until months after infection.<br>
 Untreated genital warts are infectious and can be passed on to the sexual partners.<br>
 HPV is among the most common STDs in America and abroad, with an estimated 75% of all sexually active individuals infected by some strain of the disease.<br>
 HPV is best known, because of its connection in causing cervical cancer virus, but many strains also cause genital warts.<br>
 Symptoms: HPV is considered incurable, its symptoms can be treated, and many people resolve infections on their own.<br>
 Treatment: Recently the government approved a new vaccine to protect young women from the four most common strains of the virus.<br>
 Cryotherapy can freezing the abnormal cells with liquid nitrogen and conization removes the abnormal areas.<br>
