<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="14.1.0H">14.1.0</a> Acceleration<br>
 Average acceleration = change in velocity / time taken, a = (v-u) / t<br>
 Instantaneous acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time as measured by an accelerometer in an aircraft.<br>
 You can read velocity and acceleration from displacement-time graphs and velocity-time graphs.<br>
 Deceleration occurs when the speed of a vehicle decreases, because the  vectors for velocity and acceleration are in opposite directions.<br>

<a href="../images/8.235.gif">See diagram 8.235</a>: Acceleration down an incline<br>
 1. Use a grooved three metre plank.<br>
 Incline it so that marbles will roll down the groove.<br>
 Arrange small tin flags hung from wires so that the marbles hit them and make "clinks" sounds.<br>
 Put the flags at regular intervals, e.g. 25, 50, 75, 100 cm, from the beginning of the plank.<br>
 Roll a marble down the groove and listen to the intervals between "clink" sounds.<br>
 The time between the "clinks" will reduce as the ball rolls down the incline.<br>
 Arrange the flags so that the clinks occur at equal intervals of time.<br>
 Measure the distance between the flags.<br>
 The distance between the flags increases down the incline.<br>
 2. Use an inclined air track.<br>
 For timing use a stop clock and metre stick.<br>
 Put lights that flash every second along an incline and horizontal track such that they are flashing at the moment the ball passes.<br>
 3. Observe a car on an inclined wire.<br>
 Stretch a long wire diagonally across the chalkboard with chalk marks at every metre.<br>
 Time a car as it accelerates past the marks.<br>
 4. Observe a ball on an incline.<br>
 Roll a ball bearing down the groove of a plastic metre stick.<br>
 Use a slow roller solid wheel turning on a small axis to roll down an incline.<br>
 5. Use a Duff's plane, chalk ball on incline.<br>
 Use a ball that leaves a trail while rolling down a chalk covered trough.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="14.2.2H">14.2.2</a> Acceleration of marbles down an incline<br>
 Use a 3 m plank of wood with a groove down the centre.<br>
 Incline the plank so that marbles can roll down the groove.<br>
 Arrange small tin flags hung from wires so that the marbles hit them and make "clinks" sounds.<br>
 Put the flags at regular intervals, e.g. 25, 50, 75, 100 cm, from the end of the plank.<br>
 Roll a marble down the groove and listen to the time intervals between "clink" sounds.<br>
 The time intervals between the "clinks" reduce as the ball rolls down the incline.<br>
 Arrange the flags so that the clinks occur at equal intervals of time.<br>
 Measure the distance between the flags.<br>
 The distance between the flags increases down the incline in the ratio 1: 3: 5: 7: 9.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="14.2.3H">14.2.3</a> Galileo's acceleration experiment<br>
<a href="../images/14.2.9.gif">See diagram 14.2.9</a> Galileo's acceleration experiment<br>
When Galileo was trying to measure the acceleration due to gravity with only a human pulse as a time keeper he had the idea of slowing down the acceleration so that it could be measured more accurately.<br>
So, while keeping in mind the previous pendulum experiment, he devised a system of two ramps with inclinations that could be varied and he collected much data on the movement of a ball down one ramp<br>and up the other.<br>
 1. Similarly to the previous experiment, if a round bronze ball rolls down a ramp that is smoothly connected to another steeper upward ramp, the ball will roll up the second ramp to a level almost equal to the level it started at, even if the two ramps have different slopes.<br>
 Then it will then continue to roll backwards and forwards between the two ramps, coming to rest, because of friction and air resistance.<br>
 So the ball must be going the same speed coming off one ramp as it does coming off the other.<br>
 If we imagine the second ramp steeper and steeper the ball as just falling.<br>
So for a ball rolling down a ramp, the speed at various heights is the same as the speed the ball it would have attained by just falling vertically from its starting point to that height ignoring any difference<br>
 between a rolling ball and a smoothly sliding or falling ball.<br>
 Having placed this board in a sloping position, by raising one end roll the ball, along the channel, and note the time required to make the descent.<br>
 Now roll the ball only one quarter the length of the channel and having time of its descent is one half of the former.<br>
Try other distances and compare the time for the whole length, the spaces traversed were to each other as the squares of the times, and for all inclinations
 of the channel, along which the ball was rolled.<br>
 2. Use a large vessel of water placed in an elevated position with a small diameter pipe attached to the bottom that allows water to be collected time of
 each descent, whether for the whole length of the channel or for part of its length.<br>
 Weigh the water collected after each descent.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="14.2.4H">14.2.4</a> Galileo's inclined plane<br>
<a href="../images/14.2.11.gif">See diagram 14.2.11</a> Galileo's inclined plane<br>
 Galileo's experiment, said to be done by himself at the Leaning Tower of Pisa, showed that different weight objects fall with the same acceleration
 and reach the ground simultaneously.<br>
 To study how gravity affects acceleration, he did not use falling objects, because they accelerate too quickly for accurate measurement.<br>
 So he used an inclined plane.<br>
 He found that the acceleration of a billiard ball at an angle θ = 60o down the inclined plane is not much slower than acceleration of a free falling object.<br>
 However, at an angle θ = 30o he could measure time accurately enough using a water clock, a clepsydra, and musical intervals.<br>
 He used the distance down the inclined plane during the first time interval as his unit of measure.<br>
 He discovered that the distances down the inclined plane increased by odd numbers of intervals of 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, at all angles.<br>

 So the distance covered is directly proportional to the square of the time, d ∝ t2.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="14.2.5H">14.2.5</a> Galileo's pendulum experiment<br>
<a href="../images/.gif">See diagram 14.2.9</a> Galileo's pendulum experiment<br>
 Attach an iron ball to a thread, pull it back to height h1 and let it swing as a pendulum from a nail, n1, in a board to h2,
 then swings almost back to h1 where it started.<br>
 Note that h1 and h2 are almost at the same height above the ground level.<br>
 Stop the swinging and insert a nail, n2 in the board directly below n1, 
so the n1 h1 &gt; n1 n2.<br>
 Pull the thread back to h1 and let the iron ball swing.<br>
As the pendulum swings through its lowest point, the thread hits the nail, n2 to shorten the pendulum so that the iron ball
 swings up more steeply, to G with the nail at n2.<br>
 However, the pendulum swings almost back to h1 where it started.<br>
 Note that the heights of h1 and G are almost at the same height above the level ground.<br>
 So the speed of the iron ball passes through the lowest point in the swing is the same in both directions as before n2 was inserted.<br>
 The iron ball must move at the same speed when the thread hit n2 as when  the nail wasn't there.<br>
 So how far it swings out from the vertical depends on how fast it is moving at the lowest point.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="14.2.6H">14.2.6</a> Monkey and hunter<br>

 <a href="../images/14.2.14.gif">See diagram 14.2.14</a>: Monkey and hunter 3<br>
 1. Aim the gun at the monkey when the monkey is held up high.<br>
 When the ball leaves the gun, the monkey should drop.<br>
 The ball will hit the monkey since they fall at the same rate.<br>
 Lower velocity means each falls a greater distance before hitting.<br>
 A hunter shoots a ball from compressed air gun at a target released when the gun is fired.<br>
 The ball hits the target in mid air.<br>
2. Monkey and hunter, monkey and bullet, mid-air target, path of a projectile.<br>
 The apparatus consists of a "gun" aimed at a toy monkey suspended by an electromagnet.<br>
 The bullet, on leaving the barrel, activates a light sensitive switch that releases the monkey.<br>
 The gun is aimed to hit the monkey.<br>
 The bullet can be aimed at different angles and distances so that collision occurs at different points of the monkey's path.<br>
3. Acceleration of a freely falling body is equal to the acceleration of the vertical component of a projectile.<br>
 This experiment shows that the vertical and the horizontal velocities of a projectile are independent of each other and
that the acceleration of a freely falling body is the same as the acceleration of the vertical component of a body in projectile motion.<br>
 A "gun" is aimed at a "monkey" suspended by an electromagnet.<br>
 When the "bullet" leaves the barrel of the "gun" it activates a light sensitive switch to release the "monkey".<br>
 This experiment is called "The monkey and hunter", but nowadays use a drink-can instead of a poor monkey!<br>
4. The projectile is a ball bearing and the target "monkey" is a metal drink-can hanging from an electromagnet.<br>
 The circuit of the electromagnet includes two bared wires fixed parallel to and each side of the axis of a cardboard tube.<br>
 They project about 2.5 cm beyond the end of the tube.<br>
 Complete the electrical circuit with a short length of copper wire resting on the projecting wires as a switch.<br>
 Fix the cardboard tube in a stand so that it points towards the drink-can.<br>
 Note the angle of the cardboard tube above the horizontal.<br>
 Blow the ball bearing up the cardboard tube.<br>
 When the ball bearing passes the end of the cardboard tube, it displaces the piece of copper wire, opens the switch
 and no electric current flows through the electromagnet.<br>
 So the metal can is released to fall.<br>
 The ball bearing can hit the metal drink can in mid-air if the angle of 
 the cardboard tube above the horizontal is correct.<br>
 The ball bearing will hit the drink-can at different angles of the cardboard tube (between 0o and 90o), different distances,
 and different initial speeds of the ball bearing up the cardboard tube.<br>

Catapults, trebuchet, mangonel, onager, ballista<br>
 "Da Vinci Catapult" (siege weapon), soft clay balls reach 4 m, (toy product)<br>
<a href="../images/4.140.gif">See diagram 4.140</a>: Trebuchet<br>
 Safety<br>
Projectiles may be considered as "weapons" or "firearms" under the local "Weapons Act", so before making such a device consult the
 categories of "weapons" provided by the "Police Service".<br>
Even if not classified as a weapon, a teacher may consider it too dangerous for a school activity.<br>
For example, a potato cannon may be classified as a "Muzzle Loading Firearm", if a "firearm" is defined as a "weapon that on being aimed a
 a target can cause death or injury".<br>
Catapult, trebuchet, bow &amp; arrow, baseball bat, kitchen knife, are usually not considered weapons, because bodily harm is not intended,
 but if they are used for a "behavioural offence" they then become a "weapon".<br>
Catapult<br>
A catapult is any kind of device that shoots or launches a projectile by mechanical means.<br>
Catapults use stored energy (potential energy) to hurl a projectile (kinetic energy).<br>
A simple catapult used to shoot small stones is made from a forked stick and an elastic band.<br>
Catapults can be use to launch gliders from the side of a hill or aircraft from ships.<br>
Before the invention of guns, catapults were military machines.<br>
Trebuchet<br>
A trebuchet was a siege engine used to smash walls or to throw projectiles over them.<br>
It uses leverage to propel a projectile accurately.<br>
The sling and the arm swing up to the vertical position, where usually assisted by a hook, one end of the sling releases, propelling the projectile
 towards the target with great force.<br>
The trebuchet used a falling, hinged, counterweight to launch a projectile.<br>
The counterweight was much heavier than the projectile.<br>
It was very accurate and consistent in operation.<br>
The counterweight pivots around a much shorter distance than the projectile, so the projectile reaches a much higher velocity than the counterweight
 end of the beam.<br>
The limiting speed of the falling counterweight is the speed of free fall.<br>
A teacher will limit on the size of the throwing arm, e.g. use paddle pop ice cream sticks and limit the size of the counterweight or the projectile,
 e.g. golf ball, or the projectile should be soft, e.g. a softball.<br>
Mangonel<br>
The mangonel had an arm with a bowl-shaped bucket or sling containing a projectile attached to the end.<br>
The arm is pulled back from the vertical the it rotates at a high speed and throws the projectile out of the bucket, towards the target.<br>
The launch velocity of the projectile is equal to the velocity of the arm at the bucket end.<br>
The launch angle was controlled by a crossbar.<br>
The mangonel was used for launching projectiles at lower angles than the trebuchet.<br>
The mangonel used an energy storage mechanism to rotate the arm consisting of a tension device, a bent cantilever, or a torsion device,
 e.g. a twisted rope, connected to the arm.<br>
It relied on deformable materials that would wear out and lose elasticity during use.<br>
Elastic potential energy is stored in the tension of the rope and the arm.<br>
 It does not release its energy in a linear fashion, because the arm makes an arc with radius equal to the arm's length.<br>
So potential energy is transferred into rotational kinetic energy and to translational kinetic energy of the projectile.<br>
Onager<br>
The onager was like a small trebuchet, but using a torsion bundle to rotate the arm, similar to the mangonel.<br>
Ballista<br>
The ballista was like a big crossbow using twisted rope as the energy source, like a mangonel.<br>
 It was used to shoot bolts, spears and other projectiles.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="14.3.2H">14.3.2</a> Thrust and recoil<br>
A force applied on a surface in a direction perpendicular or normal to the surface is called thrust, a reaction force of Newton's laws of motion.<br>
 A thrust force tends to increase velocity or momentum.<br>
 A drag force tends to decrease velocity or momentum.<br>
 The propellor of a ship or plane and a jet or rocket engine exerts this propulsive force.<br>
 The recoil of a gun describes how it springs back with the force of discharge.<br>
 Some guns have a hydraulic cylinder that compresses and so absorbs the shock of recoil and decelerates the rearward thrust of the firearm.<br>
Experiments<br>
1. Use a bow and arrow or catapult.<br>
 The force exerted by one arm to pull back equals the force used to hold steady the bow or the fork of the catapult.<br>
2. Hold a hose in your hand then turn of the tap.<br>
 Feel the backwards force on your hand.<br>
 Drop the hose on the ground and see it move backwards in a snake-like motion.<br>
3. Fire a rifle.<br>
 As the bullet leaves the rifle, you feel the recoil force on your shoulder.<br>
 When large guns are fired, they tend to move backwards.<br>

 <hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="14.4.1H">14.4.1</a> Free fall<br>
Free fall, measuring g<br>
An object, mass m, falling freely, without friction or air resistance, where the gravitational field is g newton / kg, experiences a force on it of mg, 
Newton, called its weight.<br>
 F = ma, Weight = mg<br>
 So acceleration due to gravity during free fall = g, where g = the size of the earth's gravitational field at that place.<br>
 Near the surface of the earth, g = 9.8 Newton per Kg, so free fall acceleration = 9.8 metres per second2, 9.8 m/sec2.<br>

 An object, e.g. a motor car, will not roll over easily if it has a low centre of gravity and a wide base.<br>
 The centre of gravity of a metre stick or uniform rod is in the centre.<br>
 If two fingers support the rod and one finger moves towards the centre of gravity the rod begins to tip towards that finger to
 increase the weight and increase  the force of friction.<br>
 The other finger feels less wight and has less friction so the rod easily slides above it.<br>
Experiments 
1. Support a metre stick or uniform rod over your two index fingers so that each finger is exactly 1 cm from the end.<br>
 The weight on the fingers feels exactly the same.<br>
 Keep the left finger in place, but slowly move the right finger towards the centre until it is half way between the centre and the end.<br>
 The metre stick feels heavier on the right finger than on the left finger.<br>
 Move the fingers together while keeping the metre stick balanced.<br>
 As your left finger moves towards the right finger, the metre stick feels heavier on it.<br>
 The weight on each finger feels about the same when the two fingers move together to be just each side of the centre of gravity.<br>
2. Repeat the experiment by moving one finger quickly and the other finger slowly.<br>
 Maintain the ruler in balance while moving the fingers.<br>
 If the metre stick remains horizontal, the two fingers always meet at
 the centre of the metre stick.<br>
3. Repeat the experiment using two round smooth 
 pencils on a level table instead of fingers.<br>
 Move the right pencil towards the middle of the rod while holding the
 left pencil in place.<br>
 As the right pencil approaches the middle of the rod the pencils have
 the same distance to the ends of the rod.<br>
 4. Repeat the experiment by hanging your hat on one end of the metre stick.<br>
 Note the new position of the centre of gravity.<br>
 5. Repeat the experiment with a broom to find its centre of gravity.<br>
6. Slide two kitchen scales under a loaded beam.<br>
 Note the scale readings of the moving and stationary scales change in
 the same way that your fingers feel change in weight under the 
 metre stick.<br>
7. Put an empty drink-can on a rough wooden board.<br>
 Raise one end of the board until the drink-can falls over.<br>
 At that angle, a vertical line through the centre of gravity of the drink-can 
 passes outside its base.<br>
8. Stand still then raise your right arm sideways.<br>
 Nothing happens.<br>
 Raise your right leg sideways.<br>
 If your upper body moves to the left, your centre of gravity remains 
over your left foot so you remain stable.<br>
 If you keep your upper body rigid, your centre of gravity moves to the 
 right and is no longer over your left foot, so you fall over.<br>

 Stand on a chair, hold the end of the string with no washer attached 
and let the string hang down.<br>
 Let the bottom washer be 30 cm above the floor.<br>
 Release the string and listen to the sound of the washers hitting the floor.<br>
 The sound intervals are not the same, they get smaller as the washers hit the floor.<br>
2. To repeat the experiment, tie an iron washer to one end of a 4 m string, then tie on other washers 15 cm, 45 cm, 75 cm, 105 cm and 135 cm apart.<br>
So the distances of the washers from the end of the string are 15 cm, 60 cm, 135 cm, 240 cm and 375 cm.<br>

The acceleration, because of gravity (acceleration of free fall) g = 9.8 m / sec2 .<br>
For a free falling body, h = gt2 / 2, so as time increases, the speed of a free falling body is faster and faster.<br>
Using the formula h = gt2 / 2, the falling distances of a free falling body at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 seconds are 0.5g, 2g, 4.5g, 8g, 14.5g.<br>
The falling distances every second are (0.5g) (2g - 0.5 g = 1.5g) (4.5g - 2 g = 2.5g) (8 g - 4.5 g = 3.5g) (14.5 g - 8 g = 4.5),<br>
 i.e. the ratio is 0.5: 1.5: 4.5: 3.5: 4 = 1: 3: 5: 7: 9.<br>

 The velocity of water in free fall from a tap increases with the distance of fall.<br>
 However, the volume of water coming out of the tap remains constant as long as the tap is not turned further on or off.<br>
 If the volume remains constant during the fall the cross-sectional area must decrease during the fall, i.e. cross sectional area X velocity = a constant.<br>
 So the steam of water gets thinner, starting when it leaves the tap.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="14.4.17H">14.4.17</a> Forces on a falling object<br>
The two forces on an object falling through the air are 1. the gravitational force, expresses as weight of the object, and 2. the aerodynamic drag of the object.<br>
Weight, W = mass of the object, m X gravitational acceleration, g, where g = 9.8 m sec-2, on the earth's surface.<br>
Drag<br>
 F<sub>D</sub> = 1/2 rho x u2 x C<sub>D</sub> x A<br>
where F<sub>D</sub>, is the drag force, i.e. the force component in the direction of the flow velocity, rho is the mass density of the fluid, u is the flow velocity relative to the object, C<sub>D</sub> is the drag coefficient, and A is the reference area.<br>
So Drag depends on u2.<br>
 Force, F = mass, m X acceleration, a, F = m a, so a = F / m<br>
 Net force on the falling object = W- D, so a = (W - D) / m<br>
 Falling body accelerates until D = W, then (W - D) = 0, so no net force and acceleration = 0, so body now falls with constant velocity, called terminal velocity.<br>
 Equations for free falling objects<br>
 Acceleration due to gravity, g = 9.81 m / s2<br>
 Position as a function of time, s = gt2<br>
 Velocity as a function of time, v = gt<br>

Drag force<br>
The drag equation is a formula used to calculate the force of drag experienced by an object due to movement through a fully enclosing fluid.<br>
F<sub>D</sub> = 1/2 rho x u2 x C<sub>D</sub> x A<br>
D is the drag force, the force component in the direction of the flow velocity, rho is the mass density of the air, u is the flow velocity relative to the man,<br>
A is the reference area, (area of the man), CD is the drag coefficient (depending on the actual situation).<br>
So Drag depends on u2.<br>
However, once the man jumps, the net force on him is just the drag force backwards so the man will move backwards relative to the car.<br>
The second diagram is correct.<br>
Comments:
Assuming that the car was travelling at 100 KPH, the drag force would be significant and if there was a head wind it would increase further.<br>
(Try sticking your head out of the window at 100 KPH!)<br>
It all then depends how high he jumps as his time in the air will be the time that the drag force applies.<br>
I doubt that the diver would end up behind the car, but they could be in danger of hitting the diving board on the way down.<br>
If you want to include the full formulae as part of your answer you could include s= ut + 1/2 at2 etc to get the time in the air.<br>
In fact a fully worked out answer would be a good addition to your text book on line.<br>
Cycling professionals can probably give you some data on the actual drag factor.<br>

 An object is in free fall if its motion is only affected by the force of gravity.<br>
 So, ignoring air resistance, an object is in free fall the moment it is released when dropped or projected.<br>
 1. The apparatus is used to show that the vertical and horizontal velocities of a projectile are independent.<br>
 The projectile is a metal ball, e.g. a ball bearing.<br>
 The target is a metal drink-can, suspended by an electromagnet.<br>
 The circuit includes two wires attached to a copper gate at the entrance to the cardboard tube.<br>
 When the circuit is closed, the drink-can is kept in position by the electromagnet.<br>
 Sight along path p1 then blows the ball up the cardboard tube.<br>
 The ball hits the copper gate to open the circuit and let the drink-can fall.<br>
 The ball travels through path p2 and hits the drink-can target in mid-air.<br>
2. The following experiment can be applied to different projectiles, e.g. golf balls, cannon balls, darts, discus, shot put, slingshot, catapult and long jumper.<br>
 If a projectile has initial horizontal velocity before it starts falling, its trajectory is a parabola, e.g. ball rolling off a table.<br>
 The only force on a projectile is gravity.<br>
 Throw a ball vertically as high as you can.<br>
 Note the time between when the ball leaves your hand and the ball stops rising.<br>
 Also, note the time between when the ball stops rising and the ball descends to the height of your hand.<br>
 The times are the same.<br>
 Throw the ball up at different angles to the horizontal and note the times taken for rising and descent.<br>
3. Hold ball 1 just over the edge of the table so that it can hit the floor when you drop it.<br>
 Put an identical ball 2 in the middle of the table and use a stick to push it steadily towards the edge of the table.<br>
 When ball 2 passes the edge of the table immediately drop ball 1.<br>
 Ball 2 has original horizontal velocity, but ball 1 has no horizontal velocity.<br>
 However, both balls fall and land on the floor simultaneously, because the acceleration due to gravity is the same, whatever their state of motion.<br>
 Both balls are projectiles.<br>
4. A body in free fall descends height, h = 1/2 gt2, where t = time and g = acceleration, because of gravity, 9.8 m / sec2.<br>
The time interval for both balls to reach the floor, t = (2h / g).<br>
If the table is 1 m high and velocity of ball B is 5 m / sec, the time of fall, t = (2 X 1) / 98 = 0.45 sec.<br>
The distance ball B travelled before reaching the floor, d = vt = 5 X 0.45 = 4.25 m.<br>
Find your "hang time", i.e. the time you are off the ground when you make a vertical jump.<br>
Hold a piece of adhesive tape between your thumb and finger, jump up next to a wall, and leave the sticky tape on the wall at the top of your jump.<br>
Use the formula: t = (2h / g), where h is the distance from the sticky tape to the floor.<br>
How high can you jump?<br>
An American basketball player can do a 1.25 metres vertical jump!<br>
5. Use a bow and arrow by pulling the bowstring back a certain distance and pointing the arrow at a certain angle to the horizontal before releasing the bowstring.<br>
Note the maximum height of the arrow and the distance it travels before hitting the ground.<br>
Repeat the experiment by pulling the bowstring back the same distance, but change the angle to the horizontal.<br>
Find the angle to the horizontal where the arrow attains the greatest height and longest distance before hitting the ground.<br>

Note how much water passes through each hole in the same period.<br>
Note the path of the water streams.<br>
Draw a diagram of the three water streams showing the distances travelled by each stream to the table top.<br>
Diagram 4.153.2 is incorrect, although it occurs in some textbooks.<br>
Diagram 4.153.1 is correct.<br>
Water from the middle hole hits the table at the greatest distance from the bottle, d2.<br>
Water from the bottom and top holes both hit the table at the same lesser distance from the bottle, d1.<br>
The greater the depth, the greater the pressure.<br>
Liquid pressure increases with depth.<br>
<br>
2. Use a 1.25-L or 2-L plastic drink bottle or a vertical acrylic tube, or a 1.5 m length and 12 cm diameter water down pipe.<br>
* Use a nail held in pliers, or heated knitting needle, or punch, to make three identical round holes in the wall of the bottle:<br>
Three holes equidistant by 6 cm vertically apart, or, three holes at 1/4 and 1/2 and 3/4 of the height, but offset so that the streams of water do not<br>
 interfere with each other, or, one hole 2 cm up from the bottom, then another hole 2 cm up, but 2 cm to the side, then another hole 2 cm up, but 2 cm to the side.<br>
So the three holes will not be directly above each other.<br>
* Plug the three holes by covering them with adhesive tape (electrician's tape).<br>
* Put the bottle on a table with a sink drain top and attach a plastic tube to a tap to keep a constant head of water when you remove the plugs.<br>
Remove the plugs from the holes, one by one<br>
* Note the speed of the water streams through the three holes.<br>
The water streams follow parabolic paths towards the sink.<br>
Feel the water with your finger as it comes out of each hole.<br>
The fastest water stream is through the lowest hole.<br>
* Measure how much water passes through each hole in the same period.<br>
* Observe the paths of the water streams and draw a diagram of the three water streams showing the distance, d, travelled by each water stream
 until it reaches the sink drain top.<br>
The water stream from the middle hole hits the table at the greatest distance from the bottle.<br>
The water streams from the bottom and top holes both hit the table at the same lesser distance from the bottle.<br>
* Diagram 14.4.24 show a right diagram, and a wrong diagram that occurs in some textbooks.<br>
* Diagram 14.4.24a shows the distances travelled by the water streams, d, with respect to vertical distances below the horizontal surface, a.<br>
Eventually, the ranks for distance, d, are 1. the water stream from the bottom hole, 2. the water stream from the middle<br>
 hole, 3. the water stream from the top hole.<br>
* Does this experiment show that in a fluid, the greater the depth, the greater the pressure or liquid pressure increases with depth?<br>
Does it show the direct relationship of pressure and depth?<br>
It is true that in a fluid at rest, hydrostatic pressure increases with depth.<br>
However, the water streams are not at rest, so Bernoulli theorem may be used to calculate the projected trajectory of the water stream, as a projectile, 
assuming that water is an almost non-viscous liquid.<br>
The Bernoulli principle states that in a non-viscous fluid, increase in the speed of the fluid occurs with a decrease in pressure or potential energy of the fluid.<br>
Using the Bernoulli's equation, H = h + v2/ 2g, so v2 = 2g X (H-h), the same as free fall<br>
Where v = speed of water stream at the exit hole, g = acceleration due to gravity, and (H-h) = the difference between the height of the water surface and
 the height of the hole.<br>
Let time of free fall = tf<br>
tf2 = 2h / g<br>
At the holes the water streams are horizontal, so range, d = velocity at the hole X time of free fall.<br>
So d = (Vh X tf) = 2 X [h (H-h)]½.<br>
When two holes have heights adding up to H, i.e. hole 1, and hole 3, their ranges are identical.<br>
The distance travelled by the water streams depends on the exit velocity at the holes and the time of flight until the water stream reaches the horizontal surface.<br>
The maximum range of a water stream occurs from the centre hole at half the height of the water.<br>
The combined ranges from the two holes equidistant from the centre hole equals the maximum range.<br>
<br>
3. Apply projectile motion to water streaming out of a hole in a 3-hole can<br>
 For the time for a water drop to fall vertically, use s = ut + 1/2gt2,<br>
 so t = sqrt (s / 0.5 g), where g = the acceleration, because of gravity, 9.8 m / sec2, and s = vertical distance from the hole to table.<br>
 For the top hole, s = 3, so t = sqrt (3 / 0.5 g), for the middle hole, s = 2, so t = sqrt (2 / 0.5 g), and for the bottom hole, s = 1,<br>
 so t = sqrt (1 / 0.5 g).<br>
 For the horizontal velocity of the drop, v, use Torricelli Theorem, v = sqrt (2gh), where h is the height from the hole to the TOP of the can.<br>
 For the top hole, h =1, so sqrt (2gh) = sqrt (2g), for the middle hole, h = 2, so sqrt (2gh) = sqrt (4g), and for the bottom hole, h =3, so sqrt (2gh) = sqrt (6g).<br>
 To find the horizontal distance the drop travels, use distance = vt.<br>
 For the top hole, vt = sqrt (3 / 0.5 X sqrt (2g) = 3.464.<br>
 For the middle hole, vt = sqrt (2 / 0.5) X sqrt (4g) = 4.<br>
 For the bottom hole, vt = sqrt (1 / 0.5) X sqrt (6g) = 3.464.<br>
 So water from the middle hole hits the table at the greatest distance, 4, from the bottle, and water from the top and bottom holes, 
both hit the table at the same distance, 3.464, from the bottle.<br>
<br>
 4. If a bottle has five equidistant holes, water passing through hole 3 and hits the table top at distance 3, d3.<br>
 Water passing through hole 2 and hole 4 and hits the table together at distance 2, d2.<br>
 Water passing through holes 1 and 5 and hit the table together at distance 1, d1.<br>
 The farthest distance from the bottle is d3, then d2, then d3.<br>
 Also (d3 - d2) = (d2 - d1).<br>
 The range of water hitting the table is greatest from the middle hole and less the farther the hole is from the middle hole.<br>
<br>
5, Torricelli tank allows water to stream from holes at different heights in a vertical glass tube.<br>
 The flow from the holes changes as you move the tube up and down.<br>
 Determine the velocity of efflux of water by the comparing the parabolic trajectory of each stream, or attach a manometer to the different openings.<br>
 Holes of different size at the same height show that the flow is independent of the diameter.<br>

 A ticker timer uses low volt AC power source to make a vibrating spring print a series of points on paper tape using circular carbon paper.<br>
 When the paper tape moves with the object, the greater the space between points the further the object has moved.<br>
 The time between any two points is equal to the reciprocal of the AC frequency, 50 HZ, so the time interval is 0.02 s.<br>
 Experiments<br>
 1. Time a falling body with a ticker timer.<br>
 Attach a weight to a strip of paper tape.<br>
 Pass the tape between the armature of an electric bell and a pad of carbon paper.<br>
 Release the paper tape so that the weight falls and drags the paper after it.<br>
 The end of the arm of the timer hits the carbon paper against the tape and makes marks on it at equal time intervals.<br>
 Measure the distance between the marks.<br>

6. To draw the (V - t) graph, calculate the instantaneous speed equal to the average speed.<br>
 Note that the window blind had begun to move before the selecting point A of t = 0, so there is a part of the graph before t = 0.<br>
 The graph shows that the curtain moves in constant acceleration before 0.35 seconds, it moves in constant speed of 2 m / s between 0.35 s and<br>
 0.65 s, and then it moves in constant deceleration.<br>
 Calculate the acceleration in AD stage from changes in the instantaneous speed in the centre of the time intervals AB and CD: (1.5 - 0.5) / (0.25 - 0.05) = 5.0 (m / s2).<br>

 1. A scalar is a quantity with magnitude (size), but no direction, e.g. 
density, energy, mass, work.<br>
 Addition of scalars is an algebraic addition.<br>
 So when a 100 g body is added to a 200 g body, its residual mass is 200 
 g.<br>
 Scalar quantities are like the rungs of a ladder.<br>
 2. A vector is a quantity with magnitude, size, and direction, e.g. force, 
 momentum, velocity.<br>
 A vector can be represented by an arrow with its length proportional to the magnitude of the vector and its direction being parallel to the direction<br>
 of the vector and so showing its direction.<br>
More than one vector acting at a point may be represented by a single resultant vector being equivalent to all of them in magnitude and direction.<br>
Vector quantities have both size and direction and you can represent vectors by lines, with length proportional to the size and direction indicated relative to some reference direction, e.g. displacement, velocity, acceleration, force and momentum.<br>
 You can add vectors to find the resultant vector, by placing drawn vectors 
 head to tail.<br>
You can resolve vectors into two perpendicular component vectors, rectangular components, so that the two components are equivalent to the single vector.<br>
 If all the forces on a body are acting in the same direction the net force 
is the simple arithmetical sum of the forces.<br>
 So a 90 kg force is needed to raise a 90 kg mass, but if three people
share the load, each person needs exert only 30 kg force.<br>

 The angle of the rope to the horizontal is θ.<br>
 The force F on the rope can be resolved into a horizontal component Fcos θ that causes the wagon to move along the road and a vertical component F sin θ that tends to lift the wagon.<br>
 So some of the force needed to move the wagon is lost, because the rope is not pulled parallel to the road.<br>

 1. Displacement and distance<br>
 If an object changes position from A to B along any path, you measure its displacement by a straight line from starting point A to 
 finishing point B.<br>
 This is a vector quantity that has magnitude (size), and direction.<br>
 Displacement is the change in position, usually with positive direction to the right.<br>
 Displacement is a vector quantity.<br>
 It is the distance between the initial point and final point of an object.<br>
 Distance = total length of travel, from beginning to end in any direction.<br>
 Distance is a scalar quantity representing the interval between two points.<br>
 It is the magnitude of the interval.<br>
 A person walks in a rectangular path A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; D -&gt; A, 
 starting from A.<br>
 At A, distance = 0, displacement = 0.<br>
 At B, distance = AB, displacement = AB, in the direction AB.<br>
 At C, distance = AB + BC, displacement = AC, in the direction AC.<br>
 At D, distance = AB + BC + CD, displacement = AD, in the direction AD.<br>
 Back at A, distance = AB + BC + CD + DA, displacement = 0.<br>
 If a motor vehicle is driven in a circle, when it returns to the starting point the displacement is zero and the distance travelled is the circumference of the circle.<br>
The motor vehicle can be driven at constant speed, but not constant velocity, because its direction of motion is continually changing.<br>
2. Instantaneous velocity<br>
 Instantaneous velocity is the rate of change of displacement on one direction with respect to time as measured by a speedometer.<br>
 However, a speedometer in a motor vehicle continues to function whether it moves only in one direction or changes direction, so a speedometer in a motor vehicle is a "speed meter" not a "velocity meter".<br>
 The instrument that shows the distance travelled by a vehicle is called an odometer.<br>
 It should show the total distance travelled by a motor vehicle unless it has been illegally wound back by an unscrupulous second hand car dealer.<br>
 An odometer that can be reset to zero to show the distance travelled during short trips in commonly called a trip meter or tripometer.<br>
