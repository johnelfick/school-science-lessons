Transformers<br>
1. Transformers convert the voltage and current in one circuit to a different voltage and current in another circuit, according to the equation: I<sub>s</sub> / I<sub>p</sub> = V<sub>p</sub> / V<sub>s</sub> 
= N<sub>p</sub> / N<sub>s</sub>,  where I = current, V = voltage, and N = number of turns in the primary, <sub>p</sub>,  and secondary, <sub>s</sub><sub>, </sub> circuits of the transformer.<br> 
A primary coil and a secondary coil of insulated wire are wound on a soft iron coil, either one on top of the other or on separate  limbs of the core, the primary coil and the secondary coil.<br> 
When AC passes through the primary coil an alternating magnetic flux  is produced in the iron core that passes through the secondary  coil.<br> 
An induced emf is produced in the secondary coil.<br> 
The output voltage in the secondary coil Vs, and the input voltage in the primary coil Vp, are related by the number of turns on the  secondary, Ns compared to the number of turns on the primary, Np.<br> 
Vs / Vp = Ns / Np.<br>
A step-up transformer has Ns &gt; Np, and a step-down transformer has  Ns &lt; Np.<br> 
In an ideal transformer, power input is equal to power output.<br> 
Experiments<br>
2. Wind 2 coils of insulated wire on the same iron  core, the primary coil and the secondary coil.<br> 
If you pass AC through the primary coil, you produce an alternating magnetic flux in the iron core that passes through the secondary  coil and an induced emf in the secondary coil.<br> 
The output voltage in the secondary coil and the input voltage in the  primary coil are related by the number of turns on the secondary  compared with the number of turns on the primary.<br> 
A step-up transformer, higher output voltage, has the number of turns  of the secondary coil greater than the number of turns of the  primary coil.<br> 
A step-down transformer, lower output voltage, has the number of turns of the secondary coil less than the number of turns of the  primary coil.<br> 
In theory, power input is equal to power output.<br> 
Direct current cannot be stepped up or stepped down with a transformer, because in a transformer a changing magnetic field cuts a  conductor, but there is no changing magnetic field from steady DC electric
current.<br> 

<br>
3.Examine a step-up and step-down transformer.<br> 
Use a step-up transformer to supply 6 volts AC to DC and light a 12 volt lamp at AB.<br> 
Use a step-down transformer to supply 12 volts AC to AB, measuring the current in the AB turns.<br> 
Take off 6 volts AC from CD to light up a large 6 volt lamp.<br> 
Measure current with an ammeter to show that if you drop the voltage  by half you double the current, and if you double the voltage  you halve the current.<br> 

<br>
4. Electrical energy is transmitted at high voltage, because the energy loss is given by I<sup>2</sup>Rt, i.e. it is proportional
to the current, squared.<br> 
The fall of potential along the wires is RI with P the potential at the generating end.<br> 
The potential at the other end is P-RI.<br> 
The power available is I(P-RI), and the power wasted in the leads is  I<sup>2</sup>R.<br> 
So I(P-RI) should be kept constant and I<sup>2</sup>R should be as small as possible.<br> 
This may be done by making R small, which means a great expense in providing leads, or by making I small in which case P must be  large.<br> 
Current is produced at comparatively low voltage and is required at a fairly low voltage for use in households.<br> 
So the low tension current is converted into high tension current for  long distance transmission by using a step-up transformer at the  generating end and a step-down transformer at the suburban or town
end.<br> 
A transformer consists of two coils, a primary, P, and a secondary S, wound, on an iron core.<br> 
An alternating current in P produces an alternating magnetic effect  in the iron core, and so also an alternating emf in S.<br> 
If N<sub>p</sub> and N<sub>s</sub> are the number of turns in the primary  and secondary respectively, and P and S the emf in the primary and secondary  respectively, then the primary emf can be changed to a secondary at 
either a higher or lower potential, and a step-up or step-down  transformer is used according to whether the secondary contains a greater  or smaller number of turns than the primary.<br> 
PN<sub>s</sub> = SN<sub>s</sub>, S / P = N<sub>s</sub> / N<sub>p</sub>.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><h3>5.</h3>
<a href="../images/30.2.02.gif">See diagram 30.2.02</a> "Step-up" transformer 2.<br> 
In the diagram, the coil on the left has fewer coils than that at right.<br> 
The sketch and circuit show a step-up transformer.<br> 
For a step-down transformer, the source is on the right and the load  is on the left.<br> 
The core has high magnetic permeability.<br> 
It forms a magnetic field more easily than free space does, caused by the orientation of atomic dipoles.<br> 
So the field is concentrated inside the core and almost no field lines  leave the core.<br> 
The magnetic flux through the primary and secondary coil are equal, as shown.<br> 
From Faraday's law, the emf in each turn of the primary or secondary  coil, is -dp / dt.<br> 
Neglecting resistance and other losses in the transformer, the terminal  voltage equals the emf.<br> 
For the Np turns of the primary coil, Vp = - N<sub>p</sub>.dΦ / dt.<br>
For the N, turns of the secondary coil, V<sub>s</sub> = NsΦ / dt.<br>
Dividing these equations gives the transformer equation:<br>
V<sub>s</sub> / V<sub>p</sub> = N<sub>s</sub> / N<sub>p</sub> = r, where r is the turns ratio.<br> 
Assuming that the voltage and the current have similar phase relationships  in the primary and secondary coils, from the principal of  conservation of energy, power in = power out, so V<sub>p</sub>I<sub>p</sub> 
= V<sub>s</sub>I<sub>s</sub>, I<sub>s</sub> / I<sub>p</sub> = N<sub>p</sub>  / N<sub>s</sub> = i / r.<br> 
If the voltage is increased, the current is decreased by at least the  same factor.<br> 
In the diagram, the coil with more turns has thinner wire, because it is designed to carry less current than the coil with fewer turns.<br> 
In power transmission lines, the power lost in heating the wires caused by their resistance is proportional to the square of the current.<br> 
To save energy, power is transmitted from power station to city at very high voltages, so that the currents are very low.<br> 
For the resistor in the secondary circuit, in the primary circuit:<br>
V<sub>p</sub> = V<sub>s</sub> / t and I<sub>p</sub> = I<sub>s</sub>r.<br>
So V<sub>p</sub> / I<sub>p</sub> = V<sub>s</sub> / r<sup>2</sup>I<sub>s</sub> = R / r<sup>2</sup>, the reflected resistance.<br> 
If the frequency is not too high, and if there is a load resistance,  the inductive reactance of the primary is much smaller than the  reflected resistance, so the primary circuit behaves as though the
source were driving a resistor of value R / r2.<br> 
This allows transformers to be used as impedance matchers.<br> 
A load with low input impedance can be matched to a circuit with high  output impedance by using a step-down transformer.<br> 

<br>
6.Transformers are less than 100% efficient.<br> 
6.1 Resistive losses in the coils, losing power I<sup>2</sup>r<br>
The resistance of the coils can be reduced by making their cross section  large and by using high purity copper.<br> 
6.2 Eddy current losses in the core<br>
Eddy currents can be reduced by laminating the core, because laminations  reduce the area of circuits in the core, and so reduce the  Faraday emf, and the current flowing in the core, and the energy thus 
lost.<br> 
6.3 Hysteresis losses in the core<br>
The magnetization and demagnetization curves for magnetic materials are often different, being hysteresis or history dependence, so the  energy required to magnetize the core while the current is increasing 
is not entirely recovered during demagnetization.<br> 
The difference in energy is lost as heat in the core.<br> 
6.4 Design and material<br>
The geometric design and the choice of material for the core must be  optimized to ensure that the magnetic flux in each coil of the  secondary is nearly the same as that in each coil of the primary CC 
vs DC generators.<br>
Transformers only work on AC, so they allow 240 V to be stepped down  to convenient levels for low power applications, e.g. 12V.<br> 
Transformers are used to step up the voltage for transmission and step  down the voltage for safe distribution.<br> 
It is possible to convert voltages in DC, but more complicated than with AC, and such conversions are often inefficient and expensive.<br> 

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="30.5.2.1H"></a><h3>30.5.2.1 Magnetostriction</h3>
Magnetostriction, humming sound of transformers, fluorescent light ballast<br>
See: <a href="../commercial/Commercial3.html#TransformerDissectable">Transformer</a>, Dissectible (Commercial).<br> 
1. Magnetostriction, a magnetic property of ferromagnetism, refers to how the state of strain in a body and its dimensions depends on  its state of magnetization.<br> 
Magnetic sheet steel extends itself when magnetized and returns to its original size when the magnetization is taken away.<br> 

<br>
2.A transformer is magnetically excited by an alternating voltage and current so that it becomes extended and contracted twice during  a full cycle of magnetization.<br> 
A transformer core contains sheets of special steel to reduce losses and moderate the ensuing heating effect, with each sheet behaving  erratically with respect to its neighbour.<br> 
The extensions are not normally visible to the naked eye, but they cause  vibration and noise, transformer hum.<br> 
In a transformer, the change in flow of electric current causes vibrations in the air and a corresponding humming sound.<br> 
The degree of magnetic flux determines the amount of magnetostriction  and hence, the noise level.<br> 
The ratio of transformer voltages to the number of turns in the winding determines the amount of magnetization.<br> 
So the amount of magnetic flux at the normal voltage is fixed as is the level of noise and vibration.<br> 
The relationship of degree of magnetization and the magnetostriction is not linear.<br> 

<br>
3.For US circuits, a mains voltage of 60 hertz is associated with maximum length change twice per cycle expansion and contraction  of 120 Hz and musical notes and harmonics at 120 Hz.<br> 
In Europe, with mains supply at 50 Hz, musical notes about 100 Hz occur.<br> 
Nickel constricts and cobalt steel lengthens when magnetized.<br> 

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="30.5.2.2H"></a><h3>30.5.2.2 Magnetoresistance</h3>
In 1852, Lord Kelvin discovered that the resistance of iron and nickel  increases when the current is in the same direction as a magnetic force and decreases when the current is at 90 to the magnetic force, 
a phenomenon called magnetoresistance.<br> 
So "magnetoresistivity" is the fractional change in resistivity due to the application of a magnetic field.<br> 
The electrical resistance and conductance of a body depends on the external magnetic field.<br> 
The magnetic domains in a metal, e.g. iron, have magnetic fields scattered  in different directions.<br> 
When the metal is placed in a strong external magnetic field, the magnetic domains line up to produce a strong magnetic field.<br> 
The realignment may cause a slight decrease in length of the iron.<br> 
The so-called "giant magnetoresistance" (GMR) occurs in a thin metallic  film of alternating layers of iron and chromium, where the  electrical resistivity of this film can be halved in a magnetic field.<br> 
This phenomenon is being used to improve the efficiency of magnetic data storage systems.<br> 

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="30.5.2.3H"></a><h3>30.5.2.3 Hall effect</h3>
See: <a href="../commercial/Commercial3.html#Halleffect">Hall Effect</a>, (Commercial).<br> 
<a href="../images/30.2.3.gif">See diagram 30.2.3</a>: Hall effect.<br> 
In 1879, the U.S. physicist Edwin Herbert Hall discovered that when a current flows  through a conductor in a magnetic field, the magnetic field exerts  a transverse force on the moving carriers of negative charge, which tends to 
push them to one side of the conductor.<br> 
So charge build-up at the sides of the conductor balances the magnetic  effect to produce voltage between the sides of the  conductor.<br> 
The strength of magnetic fields can be measured with a probe using the Hall effect.<br> 

<hr width="100%" size="2">
2. Hall-effect sensors track small changes in magnetic flux density,  too small to operate Hall-effect switches.<br> 
As motion detectors, gear tooth sensors, and proximity detectors, they  are magnetically-driven mirrors of mechanical events.<br> 
As sensitive monitors of electromagnets, they can effectively measure  a system's performance with negligible system loading.<br> 
Each Hall-effect integrated circuit includes a Hall sensing element,  linear amplifier, and emitter-follower output stage.<br> 
The Hall cell and amplifier is on a single chip.<br> 
Three package styles provide a magnetically optimized package for most  applications.<br> 
They are rated for continuous operation over the temperature range of -20C to +85C and 4.5 V to 6 V operation.<br> 

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="30.5.1.8H"></a><h3>30.5.1.8 Alternators</h3>
1. In a direct current, DC, circuit the electrons flow only in one direction.<br> 
In an alternating current circuit, AC, circuit, the direction of electron flow reverses regularly.<br> 
So a moving coil meter in a DC circuit show deflection in one way only, but in an AC circuit the pointer moves about the zero reading  if the current is very slow, or shows no deflection.<br> 
AC current can be rectified to DC current for use in certain processes,  e.g. electroplating and battery charging.<br> 
2. AC generators (alternators), operate on the  same principles of electromagnetic induction as DC generators.<br> 
Alternating voltage is generated by rotating a coil in a magnetic field  or by rotating a magnetic field within a stationary coil.<br> 
The value of the voltage generated depends on the number of turns in the coil, the strength of the magnetic field, and the speed of  rotation of the coil or magnetic field.<br> 
The transmission of high voltage alternating current, AC, over long distances is more efficient than the transmission of direct current, DC.<br> 
Currents that vary periodically in their size and direction with the  time are called alternating current.<br> 
Alternating current, like the wave, has its frequency, period, amplitude  and phase.<br> 
Classify the alternating current into low frequency and high frequency.<br> 
Lighting circuits use the low frequency of a sine wave.<br> 
Alternating voltages and currents supplied to a light bulb vary sinusoidally,  i.e. a curve having the form of a sine wave.<br> 
Alternating current reverses its polarity at regular sinusoidal intervals.<br> 
3. Alternating current is produced by an alternator,  i.e. a synchronous alternating current generator.<br> 
In the AC generator, alternator, mechanical energy turns a coil in a magnetic field, B, and a variable electromagnetic field, emf, is  induced across the ends of the coil.<br> 
Permanent sliding contacts are made with the ends of the coil.<br> 
A given contact will change from positive to negative, depending on the relative direction in which that side of the coil is moving  through the magnetic field, slip rings and contacts.<br> 
If the coil moves clockwise in the magnetic field, an end-on view of  the sides of the loop shows how the emf, is alternating.<br> 
An alternator produces an emf, which changes from positive to negative,  so the average will be zero emf.<br> 
<a href="../images/30.10.gif">See diagram 30.10</a>: Alternator, AC Generator.<br>
When side BC of the coil is in positions (1.) and (3.), the coil is moving in the same direction as the magnetic field, from N to S, no emf is produced.<br> 
When side BC of the coil is in positions (2.) and (4.), the coil is moving perpendicular to the magnetic field from N to S, maximum emf is produced.<br>

Experiment<br>
4. Simple alternator<br>
<a href="../images/30.6.7.gif">See diagram 30.6.7</a>: Simple alternator.<br> 
Use 2 solenoids, an inner and an outer solenoid.<br> 
Observe the movement of the pointer of the centre zero galvanometer when the inner solenoid is stationary.<br> 
The galvanometer pointer does not move.<br> 
Observe the movement of the pointer when the solenoid supported by a light spiral spring moves up and down.<br> 
The galvanometer pointer moves each side of the zero mark in a regular  manner corresponding to the motion of the coil.<br> 
The current passing through the galvanometer is a simple form of alternating  current.<br> 

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="30.5.1.10H"></a><h3>30.5.1.10 AC frequency</h3>
The frequency of alternating current is the number of complete alternations  (cycles) in one second, measured in hertz, Hz (formerly cycles per second, c / s, ) (Heinrich Hertz, Germany, 1857-1894).<br> 
In many countries, e.g. UK, the mains supply has frequency 50 Hz, so  one alternating current cycle lasts 1 / 50 = 0.02 seconds.<br> 

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="30.5.1.7H"></a><h3>30.5.1.7 Root mean square values, RMS values, peak value, electrical power systems</h3>
Sinusoidal time dependence, Instantaneous current, I, varies with time: I = I<sub>o</sub>.<br>
As alternating current fluctuates from positive to negative vales it  is measured by its peak value or by its root mean square value,  RMS = (peak value / 2).<br> 
This is the steady direct voltage or current that would give the same  heating effect.<br> 
The effective emf, is calculated by squaring the maximum positive emf,  (peak value), and the maximum negative emf (peak value), 
adding them together, dividing by two, and taking the square root.<br> 
The root mean square value, RMS = (peak value / 2) = (peak value is approx. 0.7071). RMS values for alternating voltage and  current, AC, are equivalent to the same values for direct voltage and
current, DC.<br> 
The waveform is sinusoidal.<br> 
As an alternator produces an emf that changes from positive to negative,  the average will be zero emf.<br> 
So the effective emf, is measured by squaring the maximum positive emf (peak value), and the maximum negative emf, (peak  value), adding them together, dividing by two, and taking the square 
root.<br> 
The root mean square value (RMS) = (1 / 2) = peak value = 0.71 x peak  value.<br> 
RMS values for alternating voltage and alternating current, AC, are equivalent to the same values for direct voltage and direct current,  DC.<br> 
RMS values for AC in the British and Australian electrical power systems  use 240 volts, RMS, at 50 cycles per second (50 Hz).<br> 
If root mean square value, RMS, voltage of the mains supply = 240 V,  the peak value is 240 / 0.7 = 340 V.<br> 
American and Japanese electrical power systems use 110 volts RMS and 60 cycles per second (60 Hz). Peak value = 120 / 2 =  170 V.<br> 

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="30.5.1.1H"></a><h3>30.5.1.1 Voltage, AC, root mean square value (RMS)</h3>
<a href="../images/30.5.1.0.gif">See diagram 30.5.1.0</a>: Resistor circuit, (light bulb).<br>
Voltage = electrical potential difference.<br> 
The AC generator produces a voltage that varies with time.<br> 
The equation for the voltage delivered by an AC generator, V = V<sub>max</sub> sin ωt, where V<sub>max</sub> is the maximum value of a voltage during a cycle, ω is the angular frequency (ω = 2πf, where f = 60 Hz in USA).<br> 
The graph for the sinusoidal time dependence for an AC circuit is similar to the graph for simple harmonic motion.<br> 
RMS value of the voltage in an AC circuit, V RMS = (1 / 2) V <sub>max</sub>, V<sub> max</sub> / 2 or V<sub> max</sub> = 2V RMS.<br> 
So if RMS of the voltage in a domestic circuit = 120 V, peak value in the circuit, V <sub>max</sub> = 2V RMS = V<sub> max</sub> = 2 x 120 = 169.7056.<br>

The current through a light bulb in a simple AC circuit, I = V / R

Calculate root mean square value, RMS 
I = I<sub>max</sub> sin ωt.<br>
Square both sides so I<sup>2</sup> is always positive, so I<sup>2</sup> 
= I<sup>2</sup><sub> max</sub> sin<sup>2</sup> ωt.<br> 
A graph of I<sup>2</sup> against time shows I<sup>2</sup> fluctuating 
symmetrically between 0 and I<sup>2</sup><sub> max</sub>, so the mean of 
I<sup>2</sup> = I<sup>2</sup> / 2.<br>
So I<sup>2</sup><sub>av</sub> = I<sup>2</sup><sub> max</sub>.<br>
So I<sub>av</sub>, i.e. I <sub>RMS</sub> = I<sub> av</sub> = (1 / 2)
I <sub>max</sub> = 0.70710678 I <sub>max</sub> = 0.71 I<sub> max</sub>
= 0.71 x peak value.<br> 
So a perfect sine wave has a RMS amplitude = about 0.7071 x the peak
amplitude.<br> 
When voltage or current is quoted, it may be a maximum value or an
RMS value, as is usually quoted by ammeters and voltmeters, so 
use the equation: I <sub>max</sub> = 2 x I<sub> RMS</sub>.<br>

Impedance is the general name given to the ratio of voltage to current.<br> 
So resistance is a kind of special case of impedance.<br> 
Impedance is a measure of the combined opposition to the passage of

Series impedance, ZRC = square root of [R<sup>2</sup> + 1 /( ωC)<sup>2</sup>].<br> 
Series impedance depends on frequency.<br> 
At low frequency, the impedance is large, because the capacitative reactance, 1 / ωC, is large.<br>

<a href="../images/30.5.3.7B.gif">See diagram 30.5.3.7C</a>: Ohm' s law in AC.<br>
The voltage leads the current by angle Φ.<br> 
The voltage is behind the current, because the capacitor takes time
to charge up, so Φ is negative.<br> 

<br>
4.Selecting low or high frequencies<br>
At low frequencies, the impedance of the series RC circuit is dominated
by the capacitor, so the voltage is 90<sup>o</sup> behind the current.<br> 
At high frequencies, the impedance approaches R and the phase difference
approaches zero.<br> 
The frequency dependence of Z and Φ are important in the application
of RC circuits.<br> 
At low frequencies, the voltage is mainly across the capacitor.<br> 
At high frequencies the voltage is mainly across the resistor.<br>

V<sup>2</sup><sub>RC</sub> =V<sup>2</sup><sub>R</sub> + V<sup>2</sup><sub>C</sub>.<br> 
At the frequency, ω = ωo = 1 / RC, the phase Φ = 45<sup>o</sup>, and
the voltage fractions are VR / VRC = VC / VRC = V = 0.71.<br> 
By choosing to look at the voltage across the resistor, VR, you select 
mainly the higher frequencies.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="30.5.4.8H"></a><h3>30.5.4.8 Inductors</h3>
Inductors, inductance, inductive reactance, self induction, mutual induction<br>
<a href="../images/30.5.1.0.gif">See diagram 30.5.4.0</a>: Inductor circuit.<br> 
Induction is the production of an electrical or magnetic state in an
object, caused by 
its nearness to another electrified or magnetic object, but without 
touching it.<br> 
1. An inductor is a conductor in which an electromotive force or 
current is induced.<br> 
The inductance of a conductor is when any variation in current through 
it induces an electromotive force (voltage) in it (self-inductance), 
or in any other conductor (mutual inductance).<br> 
In self-induction, a current is induced in a circuit caused by a variation 
in current in that circuit.<br> 
In mutual induction, the variation in current flowing through one circuit 
causes an electromotive force in another nearby circuit.<br> 
The SI unit of inductance, the henry, H, is the inductance of a circuit 
where an electromotive force of one volt is formed by a current 
changing at the rate of one ampere per second.<br> 

<br>
2. In accordance with Ohm's law, current passing 
through a resistance, e.g. a straight wire, decreases as resistance increases, 
whether 
the current is DC or AC.<br> 
So when a straight wire or a coil of wire is connected to DC, it draws 
an electric current, I = V / R, and it gets hot as energy is 
dissipated in the wire until the wire melts.<br> 
However, if a coil of wire is connected to AC and the frequency increased, 
the coil shows inductive reactance, called "electrical 
sluggishness", because it takes some time for the current to form in 
the coil as each voltage cycle occurs.<br> 
As the AC frequency is increased, at some frequency the current 
cannot form in the coil before the polarity of the voltage reverses.<br> 
So almost no current forms in the coil and it remains cool.<br> 
If the supply delivered the same power as a DC source it would melt 
the wire.<br> 

<br>
3. Inductive reactance X<sub>L</sub> (ohms) = 2 
π fL, where f = frequency of the current (hertz), and L = inductance of 
the coil (henry).<br> 
If inductance is constant in a coil, inductive reactance increases
with AC frequency.<br> 
However, if AC frequency is constant, inductive reactance increases 
with increasing inductance.<br> 

<br>
4. When electric current flows through the coil 
from the left to the right, a magnetic field is generated in a clockwise 
direction.<br> 
The inductor stores electrical energy in the form of magnetic energy.<br> 
The more turns of the coil, the stronger the magnetic field generated.<br> 
A stronger magnetic field can be generated by increasing the cross-sectional 
area of the inductor, or by changing the core of the 
inductor.<br> 
If AC current is flowing through the inductor, the magnetic field generated 
by that current cuts across the other windings, causing an 
induced voltage and preventing any changes in the current level.<br> 
If the current is about to rise suddenly, an electromotive force is 
generated in the opposite direction to the current, preventing any 
increase in the current.<br> 
If the current is about to drop, an electromotive force is generated
in the direction in which the current is increased.<br> 
So the coil allows DC, but not AC, to flow through it.<br> 
The emf always opposes the change in current (c.f. Lenz's law).<br> 

<br>
5. The largest voltage across the inductor occurs 
when the current is changing most rapidly, i.e. when the current is instantaneously 
zero.<br> 
The voltage across the ideal conductor is 90<sup>o</sup> ahead of the 
current, i.e. it reaches its peak one quarter cycle before the current does.<br> 

<br>
6. An inductor, choke, is usually a coil of wire, 
with an air or iron core, that ideally has negligible resistance and capacitance.<br> 
The voltage that appears across an inductor is caused by its own magnetic 
field and Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction.<br> 
The current passing through the coil creates a magnetic field whose 
magnetic flux is proportional to the field strength, which is 
proportional to the current flowing.<br>

voltage across an 
inductor, V = IX<sub>L</sub>, where XL is the inductive reactance.<br> 
Inductive reactance, X<sub>L</sub> = ωL.<br> 
Diagram 30.5.4.5 shows that the capacitative reactance, X<sub>C</sub>,

Note the resistance, R, is independent of frequency.<br>

The voltage across the ideal conductor is 90<sup>o</sup> ahead of the

its peak.<br> 

<br>
3. Diagram 30.5.2.01b also show that the reactance 
is frequency dependent, XL = ωL.<br> 
When the frequency is halved, but the current amplitude kept constant, 
the current is varying only half as quickly, as is the Faraday emf.<br> 
For an inductor, the ratio of voltage to current increases with frequency.<br> 

<br>
4. Inductive reactance, X<sub>L</sub>, increases 
with frequency, unlike capacitive reactance, X <sub>c</sub>, because the
higher the frequency the more

Diagram 30.5.4.2 shows the current in an inductor circuit.<br> 
At time zero the current is zero, but increasing at it maximum time 
rate.<br> 
Voltage across an inductor depends on the rate of change of current, 
so the voltage of the inductor is a maximum at t = 0.<br> 
When the current reaches a maximum at time ωt = π / 2, the rate of
change of the current becomes zero.<br> 
So at that point the voltage across the inductor falls to zero.<br> 
The current and the voltage of the inductor are a quarter of a cycle, 
90<sup>o</sup>, out of phase.<br> 
The voltage reaches a maximum before the current reaches a maximum, 
so in an inductor the voltage leads the current by 90<sup>o</sup>.<br>

If the circuit contained only a resistor, the current has the same
RMS current with increasing frequency, so the RMS current does not 
change.<br> 

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="30.5.4.4H"></a><h3>30.5.4.4 Dimmers</h3>
Observe the brightness of a light bulb, resistance R, in a circuit
powered by an AC generator.<br> 
The current through the light bulb, I<sub>RMS</sub> = V<sub>RMS</sub> 
/ R.<br> 
Add an inductor, L, to the circuit.<br> 
The impedance, Z = (R<sup>2</sup> + X<sub>L</sub><sup>2</sup>) &gt; 
R.<br> 
So the current in the circuit, I<sub>RMS</sub> = V<sub>RMS</sub> /
Z.<br> 
The current is less, so the light bulb is glows dimmer.<br> 
In a light dimmer, an iron rod is moved into or out of the coil of
an inductor.<br> 
When the iron rod is deeper in the coil, the inductance is increased, 
so the current is decreased in the circuit and the light glows dimmer.<br>

<a href="../images/30.5.4.7.gif">See diagram 30.5.4.7</a>: Impedance of capacitor, conductor and resistor.<br> 
1. In an AC circuit, impedance refers to the combined opposition to 
movement of alternating current caused by the resistance (R), 
and the reactance (X), measured by the ratio of the electromotive force
to the resulting current.<br> 
Impedance Z = (R<sup>2</sup> + X<sup>2</sup>).<br> 
Only the ohmic resistance (R), dissipates electrical energy as heat.<br> 

<br>
2. Total impedance, Z, is the total opposition
to current flow from :<br>
2.1. inductance (L),<br>
2.2. resistance (R), and<br>
2.3. capacitance (C), in an AC circuit.<br> 
Impedance Z = (R<sup>2</sup> + [XL - XC]<sup>2</sup>).<br> 

<br>
3.Resonance in series AC<br>
A circuit produces the largest possible response to an applied oscillating
signal when its inductive and capacitative reactances are 
balanced.<br> 
Maximum current will flow in a circuit affected by inductance, resistance, 
and capacitance, when the inductive reactance (X<sub>L</sub>) cancels 
the capacitive reactance (X<sub>c</sub>).<br> 
Impedance is the combined opposition to the passage of AC exerted by
the resistance (R).<br> 
Reactance (X<sub>c</sub>), measures the ratio of the electromotive 
force to the resulting current, so Z = (R<sup>2</sup> + X<sub>L</sub><sup>2</sup>).<br> 
Impedance is the general term for the ratio of voltage to current.<br> 
Resistance is the special case of impedance when Φ (phi) 
= 0.<br> 
Reactance is a special case of impedance when Φ (phi), 
= 90<sup>o</sup>.<br> 
The voltage on the capacitor is behind the current, because the charge
does not build up until after the current has been flowing for 
some time.<br>

<a href="../images/30.5.6.0.gif">See diagram 30.5.6.0</a>: LC circuit.<br> 
1. AC circuits have a natural frequency of oscillation, similar to
a pendulum, or mass supported by a spring.<br> 
So an LC circuit containing only an inductor and a capacitor has the
nature frequency, ω<sub>o</sub> = 1 / LC = 2πf<sub>o</sub>.<br> 
At ω = 1 / LC, an RLC circuit has maximum current, resonance.<br> 

<br>
2. The expression for the series impedance goes 
to infinity at high frequency, because the inductor produces a large emf 
if the current 
varies rapidly.<br> 
Similarly, the expression is large at very low frequencies, because
of the capacitor, which has a long time in each half cycle to charge up.<br> 
<a href="../images/30.5.5.0.2.gif">See diagram 30.5.5.02</a>: Time dependent voltages, v(t), add up, RMS voltages do not add up.<br>
<a href="../images/30.5.5.0.3.gif">See diagram 30.5.5.03</a>: Z<sub>series</sub> depends on the angular frequency, ω.<br> 
In the plot of Z<sub>series</sub>ω, there is a minimum value of the 
series impedance, when the voltages across capacitor and inductor are equal 
and opposite, i.e. v<sub>L</sub>(t) = v<sub>C</sub>(t) = va(t).<br> 
So V<sub>L</sub>(t) = V<sub>C</sub>.<br> 
So ωL = l / ωC, and the frequency at which this occurs is ω<sub>o</sub> 
= 1 / LC, where ω<sub>o</sub> is the angular frequency of resonance and
f<sub>o</sub> is the 
cyclic frequency of resonance.<br> 
At resonance, series impedance is a minimum, so the voltage for a given 
current is a minimum or the current for a given voltage is a 
minimum.<br> 

<br>
3. In an RLC series circuit in which the conductor 
has relatively low internal resistance, r, it is possible to have a large 
voltage across 
the inductor, and an almost equally large voltage across the capacitor, but the inductor and the capacitor are nearly 180<sup>o</sup> out of phase, 
so their voltages almost cancel, giving a small total series voltage.<br> 
This is one way to produce a large voltage oscillation with only a
small voltage source.<br> 
In the circuit diagram at right, the coil corresponds to both the inductance 
L and the resistance R, which is why they are drawn inside a 
box representing the physical component, the coil.<br> 
They are in series, because the current flows through the coil and thus 
passes through both the inductance of the coil and its resistance.<br> 
A big voltage occurs in the circuit for only a small voltage input from 
the power source.<br> 
The energy stored in the large oscillations is gradually supplied by
the AC source when the circuit is closed and the energy is then 
exchanged between capacitor and inductor in each cycle.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="30.5.5.6H"></a><h3>30.5.5.6 The limit of very  high and very low frequencies</h3>
At very high frequencies, the reactance of an inductor becomes very 
large and behaves like a large resistor with almost no current 
flowing, and behaves like an open circuit.<br> 
However, the reactance of the capacitor becomes very small, and acts 
like a wire with no resistance.<br> 

<br>
At very low frequencies, e.g. an AC generator replaced
by a battery, the reactance of an inductor becomes almost zero, and acts 
like a wire with no resistance.<br> 
However, the reactance of the capacitor becomes very large, and behaves 
like an open circuit.<br> 
I<sub>RMS</sub> approaches zero.<br> 

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="30.5.6.1H"></a><h3>30.5.6.1 Bandwidth and Q  factor</h3>
<a href="../images/30.5.6.1.gif">See diagram 30.5.6.1</a>: Maximum power converted at resonance, ω = ω<sub>o</sub>.<br> 
At resonance, the voltages across the capacitor and the pure inductance 
cancel.<br> 
So the series impedance has its minimum value: Z<sub>o</sub> = R.<br> 
So if the voltage is kept constant, the current is a maximum at resonance.<br> 
The current goes down to zero at low frequency, because X<sub>C</sub> 
becomes infinite.<br> 
The current falls to zero at high frequency, because X<sub>L</sub> increases 
with ω when the inductor opposes rapid changes in the current.<br> 
Diagram 30.5.6.1 shows I(ω) for a circuit with a large resistor, the 
lower curve, and with a small resistor, the upper curve.<br> 
A circuit with low R, for a given L and C, has a sharp resonance.<br> 
Increasing the resistance makes the resonance less sharp.<br> 
The former circuit is more selective.<br>
It produces high currents only for a narrow bandwidth, i.e. a small 
range of ω or f.<br> 
The circuit with higher R responds to a wider range of frequencies 
and so has a larger bandwidth.<br> 
The bandwidth Aω (see the horizontal bars on the curves), is defined 
as the difference between the two frequencies ω and ω at which 
the circuit converts power at half the maximum rate.<br> 
The electrical power converted to heat in this circuit = I<sup>2</sup>R, 
so the maximum power is converted at resonance, ω = ω<sub>o</sub>.<br> 
The circuit converts power at half this rate when the current is I<sub>o</sub> 
2.<br> 
The Q value is defined as the ratio Q = ω<sub>o</sub> / ω.<br> 

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="30.5.6.2H"></a><h3>30.5.6.2 Impedance versus frequency graph</h3>
<a href="../images/30.5.6.2.gif">See diagram 30.5.6.2</a>: Impedance versus frequency graph.<br> 
Series impedance rises to infinity at high frequency, because the 
inductor produces a large emf if the current varies rapidly.<br> 
Similarly series impedance is large at very low frequency, because the
capacitor has a long time in each half cycle to get charged.<br> 
The minimum value of series impedance occurs when the voltages across 
the capacitor and inductor are equal and opposite, 
i.e. v<sub>L</sub>(t) = - VC(t), so VLt = VC.<br> 
ωL = 1 / ωC, and this occurs at frequency ω<sub>0</sub> = 1 / LC.<br> 
f<sub>0</sub> = 1 / 2π 1 / LC, where ω<sub>0</sub> is the angular frequency 
of resonance and f<sub>0</sub> is the cyclic frequency of resonance.<br> 
At resonance, series impedance is a minimum, so the voltage for a
given current is a minimum, or the current for a given voltage is a 
minimum.<br> 
So in an RLC circuit where the inductor has a low internal resistance, 
r, a large voltage can occur across the inductor and an equally 
large voltage can occur across the capacitor.<br> 
However, their voltages can cancel, because the two voltages are 180<sup>o</sup> 
out of phase.<br> 
So a large voltage oscillation can be formed with a small voltage input 
from the power source.<br> 
The energy stored in the oscillations is gradually supplied by the 
AC source and is then exchanged between the capacitor and inductor 
in each cycle.<br> 

<br>
Diagram 30.5.6.2 shows impedance, Z, versus frequency
ω, where Z= R<sup>2</sup> + ( X<sub>L </sub> - <sub> </sub>X<sub>C)</sub><sup>2</sup>
= R<sup>2</sup> + (ωL - 1 / ωC)<sup>2</sup>.<br> 
The smallest value for impedance is where Z = R, where X<sub>L</sub>
= X<sub>C</sub>.<br> 
[Substitute X<sub>L</sub> = X<sub>C</sub> in Z = R<sup>2</sup> + (
X<sub>L </sub> - <sub> </sub>X<sub>C)</sub><sup>2</sup>, then Z = R<sup>2</sup>

LC circuits.<br>

Diagram 30.5.6.3 shows current plotted against frequency in an RLC
circuit.<br> 
The peak current is at the resonance frequency, 1 / LC.<br> 
Larger resistance reduces the maximum current in the circuit, but does 
not change the natural frequency.<br> 
Larger resistance does make the resonance peak lower and broader.<br> 
So resonance can occur over a wide range of frequencies with only a 
small increase of current.<br> 
Smaller resistance increases the maximum current in the circuit, but
does not change the natural frequency.<br> 
Smaller resistance does make the resonance peak higher and sharper.<br> 
So resonance can occur over a narrow range of frequencies with a large 
increase in current.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="30.5.11H"></a><h3>30.5.11 Saving energy</h3>
1. Turn incandescent lights off when they are not needed.<br> 
Incandescent lighting accounts for about 85% of household illumination.<br> 
Although incandescent light bulbs are the least expensive to buy, they 
are more expensive to operate, because of their short life spans 
and relative inefficiency.<br> 
Only 10 to 15% of the electricity that incandescent lights use results
in light.<br> 
The rest turns into heat.<br> 
The value of the energy saved by not having such lights on is far greater 
than the cost of replacing these bulbs.<br> 
The power surge from turning on a light uses as much power as leaving 
it on for a fraction of a second.<br> 
However, for fluorescent tube lights, the start-up uses about 23 seconds 
worth of power.<br> 
Also, turning the light on and off repeatedly does not reduce the total 
life expectancy of the light bulb enough to offset the increased 
electricity usage.<br> 
So turning a light off is more economical than leaving it on.<br> 
Fluorescent light tubes are more expensive than incandescent light
bulbs to buy and their operating life also is affected more by the 
number of times they are switched off and on.<br> 
So turn fluorescent lights off if leaving a room for more than five 
minutes.<br> 

<br>
2. To calculate the value of energy savings by
turning a light off, determine how much energy the light consumes when it
is turned on by 
reading the watt rating printed on the light.<br> 
Check the cost of electricity per kWh from the utility bill.<br> 
The cost may be different during peak versus general periods.<br> 
So leaving a 40-watt bulb on for one hour consumes 0.04 kWh.<br> 
If your electric rate is 15 cents per kWh, your energy savings is 0.6 
cents.<br> 
Compact florescent lights (CFLs) use 1 / 6th of the energy that a standard 
incandescent bulb uses while producing the same amount 
of light.<br> 
They are more expensive, but they last about 10 times longer than standard 
incandescent bulbs.<br> 

<br>
3. To save energy when using a computer, turn off 
the monitor if away for 20 minutes, and shut down the main computer if 
away for 
more than two hours.<br> 
A computer may have a "stand by" mode that uses 70% less power than 
normal, and a "shut down" option that turns the computer fully 
off.<br> 
A screen saver that shows any image on the screen does not save any 
energy.<br> 
laptop computers use much less energy than desktop computers.<br> 

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="30.5.1.9H"></a><h3>30.5.1.9 Circuits in homes</h3>
Circuits in homes, ring circuits, radial circuits, lighting circuits, power sockets and plugs<br>
1. Ring circuits are commonly used in the United Kingdom, Indonesia, 
Republic of Ireland, Singapore and United Arab Emirates.<br> 
Radial circuits are commonly used in Australia, and in many other countries.<br> 
The incompatibility in the over current protection of appliance leads 
between countries using ring and radial circuits has been a major 
stumbling block on the road to world wide standardization of domestic
AC power plugs and sockets.<br> 
Plug fuses can be better matched to the maximum current required by 
an appliance, but some plugs in the UK are fitted with a fuse of 
the maximum permitted rating of 13 A, because a lower rated device may 
well operate intermittently due to "surges".<br> 
So the fused plug offers no advantage over an unfused plug used on
radial circuit with a 13 A fuse, or B16 or lower circuit breaker.<br> 

<br>
2. Ring circuits (ring mains circuits, ring final
circuits), have a cable leaving the consumer unit and travelling to each 
socket on the main.<br> 
When it reaches the last socket, it then returns to the consumer unit, 
so creating a ring.<br> 
The advantage of ring circuits is that power can reach the sockets
in the circuit from both directions and so reduce the power load on 
the cables.<br> 
A ring circuit has a 30 amp fuse or 32 amp MCB on the consumer unit.<br> 
A house usually has one ring circuit upstairs and one ring circuit
downstairs.<br> 
Ring circuits can have extra sockets added to them by adding a "spur" 
onto a ring circuit.<br> 
The maximum load of the circuit (30 / 32 amp) still exists).<br> 

<br>
3.Ring circuits in England<br>
<a href="../images/30.6.7.3.gif">See diagram 30.6.7.3</a>: Household ring main circuit in England.<br> 
<a href="../images/30.6.7.4.gif">See diagram 30.6.7.4</a>: Socket outlet and fused plug.<br> 
The wiring in a house connects all appliances together in parallel.<br> 
This is so that each has the mains supply of 230 volts across it and 
also so that they can all be used independently.<br> 
The consumer unit contains the main switch and the fuses for all of 
the fixed circuits, e.g. the power ring circuit and the lighting circuit.<br> 
The power sockets in a house are connected by means of a ring circuit.<br> 
In a ring circuit, the live, neutral and earth wires form a loop of 
cable going from the consumer unit to all of the sockets in turn and then 
back to the consumer unit.<br> 
The advantages of using a ring circuit are that the cables can be made 
thinner, because there are two paths for the current, so each part 
of the cable carries less current.<br> 
A ring circuit is more convenient, because sockets can be placed anywhere
on the ring.<br> 
The principle of the radial circuit, is that the mains cable leaves 
the consumer unit and passes through each socket until it reaches and 
ends at the last socket.<br> 
Alternatively, on a ring circuit the mains cable leaves the consumer
unit passes through every socket and then returns to the consumer 
unit.<br> 
The advantage of the ring circuit is that electricity can reach the 
sockets from two directions and so reduces the load on the cable.<br> 

<br>
4. Electricity is usually connected to homes by
a supply cable containing two wires, the live wire, L, and the neutral
wire, N.<br> 
The neutral wire is earthed at the local substation and so is at zero 
potential.<br> 
The supply is AC, so the live wire is alternately positive and negative.<br> 
Every circuit is connected in parallel with the supply, i.e. across 
the live, L (brown wire) and neutral, N (blue wire) and receives the 
full mains potential difference of 240 V.<br> 
Switches and fuses are always in the live, L, wire.<br> 
If they were in the neutral, N, wire, lamp and power sockets would
be "live" when switches were "off" or fuses "blown".<br> 
A fatal shock could then be received, e.g. by touching the element
of an electric fire when it was switched off.<br> 
In the ring main circuits, the live and neutral wires run in two complete 
rings around the house.<br> 
The power sockets, rated at 13A, are connected off from them.<br> 
The ring has a 30 A fuse and total current must not exceed 30 A.<br> 
Each fused plugs used in the ring main circuit has its own cartridge
fuse.<br> 
A ring main circuit has a third earth wire, E (yellow green), which
connects to the top sockets on all power points, and is usually 
earthed by being connected either to a metal water pipe.<br> 
This third wire is a safety precaution to prevent electric shock if 
an appliance develops a fault.<br> 
The earth pin on a 3-pin plug is connected to the metal case of an
appliance, which is thus joined to earth by a path of almost zero 
resistance.<br> 
So if the element of an electric fire breaks and touches the metal 
case, a large current flows to earth and "blows" the fuse.<br> 

<br>
5. In a ring final circuit (ring-main system, 
ring circuit), the line conductor starts and ends at the same line terminal, 
and the neutral 
conductor starts and ends at the same neutral terminal in the consumer 
unit.<br> 
So the line current can flow in two opposite directions to the same 
load and the current-carrying capacity of the conductors is larger 
than it would be if the same cross-sectional area conductors were used 
in a radial system.<br> 
Loads connected to the ring main system are individually fused using 
fused plugs.<br> 
A ring circuit goes to every socket and at the last socket it returns 
to the consumer unit.<br> 
It starts at the consumer unit and returns to the consumer unit and 
is usually protected by a 30 amp fuse or 32 amp circuit breaker.<br> 
It can have any number of sockets or fused connection units on it, 
but the maximum load is 7200 watts.<br> 
So usually three ring mains circuits are installed in a house, on the 
ground floor, on the upstairs floor and one serving the kitchen where 
most of the high consumption appliances are connected.<br> 
Both ends of the ring are connected to the same terminals at the consumer 
unit, so the current runs in both directions imposing less load 
on the cables.<br> 
Electricity loses power over long lengths of cable and trying to put
too much power through a cable, which is not designed for it, is 
dangerous, so a ring main delivers power from both ends to keep the
load as light as possible.<br> 

<br>
6. In both ring final circuits and radial final 
circuits each socket outlet is connected from the previous socket, but in
ring final circuits the 
last socket is returned to the same three terminals in the distribution 
board, so the two ends of each conductor must be clamped under 
the same terminal screw.<br> 
All the outlets should be included in the ring, but a branch connection 
called a spur may be used to supply permanently connected 
appliances.<br> 
The spur cable must be protected, e.g. by a 5 amp fuse.<br> 

<br>
7. Radial circuits, radial final circuits, have
a cable leaving the consumer unit and travelling to each socket, similar
to the ring circuit.<br> 
However, when the circuit reaches the last socket the cable ends, unlike
a ring main that travels back to the consumer unit.<br> 
Radial circuits can therefore only serve a smaller area.<br> 
In a similar way to ring circuits, spurs can be added at points along the radial 
circuit if required.<br> 
High-powered appliances (cookers / showers) must have their own radial
circuit.<br> 
In a "radial circuit" only one end of the circuit is connected to the 
line and neutral terminals, with opposite ends terminating at a load.<br> 
A radial circuit stops at the final socket.<br> 
Radial circuit is from the panel and stops at the outlet without going back to the panel.<br> 
It is simply a length of appropriately rated cable feeding one power
point then going on to the next.<br> 
The circuit terminates with the last point on it.<br> 
It does not return to the consumer unit or fuse box.<br> 
In a radial final circuit supplying sockets, each socket outlet is fed via the previous socket.<br> 
Live is connected to live, neutral to neutral and earth to earth at each socket outlet.<br> 
The maximum number of socket outlets per circuit is ten.<br> 
The radial final circuit should not supply more than two rooms.<br> 
A kitchen should be supplied by at least two radial circuits.<br>

8.Radial circuits in Australia<br>
<a href="../images/30.6.7.1.gif">See diagram 30.6.7.1</a>: Household radial circuit in Australia.<br> 
Socket outlet and 3-pin plug, 230 volt male plug.<br> 
Australian circuit.<br>
In 1983, Standards Australia adopted a 20 year plan to convert Australia
from the nominal 240 volts to 230volts, to align with 
European Standards - IEC38.<br> 
The aim was to align Australian manufactured products with the main 
trading partners.<br> 
Domestic power sockets and plugs in Australia<br>
Contacts, flex conductor colour:<br>
Active A, "live wire" at 230 V with respect to earth, brown flex wire,<br>
Neutral, N, the return to the substation, nearly 0 V, blue flex wire,<br>
Earth, E, connects to the earth near the building, usually via water pipes.
green / yellow flex wire.<br>
The 230 volt male plug, when viewed so that you are looking at the pins and
the earth pin is at the bottom, has the active pin at the right.<br> 
Appliances with a metal case usually have that case connected to the
earth pin, so when plugged in this connection provides a low 
resistance pathway to ground.<br> 
An earthed case provides low resistance return path and blows fuse, 
or preferably triggers an earth leakage detector.<br> 
The switches are in the active line so the master switches should be
off before changing fuses.<br> 
GPO, General Purpose Outlet, it is an electrical term.<br> 
The definition for GPO in the AS3000 "Australian Standard for Wiring
Rules" is "three pin flat pin 10 amp socket outlet" (or "power 
point" as commonly known).<br> 
However, the definition was removed from the 2000 edition of the wiring 
rules and "power points" are now defined as "socket outlets".<br> 

<br>
9.Lighting circuits are basically radial circuits.<br> 
There are two distinct types of lighting, circuit the loop-in circuit 
and the older junction box circuit.<br> 
The loop-in circuit has a cable, running from light to light terminating 
at the last light as in the conventional radial circuits and then single 
cable runs from the lights to the light switches.<br> 
The other type of lighting circuit has a junction box for each light.<br> 
The cable runs from the consumer unit to the first junction box and 
then onto the next terminating at the last junction box.<br> 
Then another cable is run from each junction box to its light and another 
wire from the junction box to that light switch.<br> 
A 5 amp fuse or 6 amp MCB is used on the consumer unit for a lighting 
circuit.<br>
