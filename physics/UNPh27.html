The visible spectrum or spectrum, a term invented by Isaac Newton, refers to the coloured band into which a beam of light is split when passing through a prism or diffraction grating.<br>
The coloured band may contain bright or dark lines corresponding to frequencies emitted or absorbed.<br>
The electromagnetic spectrum contains the entire range of frequencies of electromagnetic radiation from longest radio waves to shortest gamma rays, 
 including the visible spectrum.<br>

 A diffraction grating is a piece of plastic or glass with many opaque
 parallel lines rules on it, e.g. 100 lines per mm, 300 lines per mm, 1000 per mm, 13, 500 lines per inch.<br>
When light rays enter the spectroscope, they are separated, according to different wavelengths, into a spectrum or spectra and produce an interference pattern are sharpened to appear as bright lines of reinforcement (maxima).<br>
 Each element has its own characteristic bright lines on its spectrum 
so the spectroscope is used for chemical analysis.<br>
 Spectroscopes are also used in astronomy to determine the elements in
 the sun and stars, because it can produce separated line images for light sources with similar wavelengths.<br>
 The spectroscope invented by Joseph von Fraunhofer in 1820 used fine 
parallel wires.<br>
Experiments<br>
1. Make a diffraction grating by drawing evenly-spaced clear black lines
 on a white card.<br>
 Then take a high quality black and white photograph using a camera stand.<br>
 Use the negative for a diffraction grating.<br>
 However, you can also purchase cheap diffraction gratings as novelty 
spectacles, called "rainbow glasses".<br>
2. Cut a 2 cm diameter round hole at one end of
 a cardboard shoe box.<br>
 Attach a diffraction grating across the hole on the inside of the box.<br>
 Note the direction of the slit on the grating.<br>
 In the opposite side of the box, cut a 0.5 cm X 2.5 cm slit opposite 
the diffraction grating, with the longer side horizontal.<br>
 Attach two razor blades to the outside of the slit, almost edge to edge, 
 to form a very narrow vertical slit.<br>
 Place a 12 V vertical filament lamp, e.g. a neon lamp or argon lamp, 
in front of the slit.<br>
 Adjust the distance between the two razor blades so that you may see 
clear linear spectrums when you look through the round hole.<br>
 Use the diffraction grating and a sharp source of light to see the order
 of colours in the spectrum.<br>
 ROYGBIV, represents red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.<br>
 Note the bright lines in spectra produced by fluorescent mercury lamps
 and neon signs.<br>
3. Hold a feather near your eye and observe a burning
 candle far from you.<br>
 Adjust the distance of feather from your eye until you see four X-shaped 
 colour bands.<br>
 You may also see two blue and two red bands in each of the four bands.<br>
4. Stretch nylon gauze or a woman's fine scarf
tightly and observe a burning candle through it.<br>
 See colour stripes appearing in the direction of the fibres.<br>
 Different weaving and different shapes of small holes will affect different
 shape of the stripes.<br>
 You may see an X-shaped diffraction pattern through some types of nylon
 gauze.<br>
5. Make a spectrum without a prism.<br>
 Set a tray of water in bright sunlight.<br>
 Lean a rectangular pocket mirror against an inside edge with the lower
 part immersed in the water.<br>
 Adjust the mirror so that a spectrum appears on the wall.<br>
 6. Pass light through a spherical flask of water and view the rainbow
 on a screen placed between the light and the flask.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.137H"></a>4.137 Colours of soap films<br>
 Make a strong soap solution as used for blowing soap bubbles.<br>
 Fill a flat dish with the solution then dip a cup into the solution until
 a soap film forms across the cup.<br>
 Hold this in a strong light so that the light reflects from the film.<br>
 Note the colours.<br>
 Tilt the cup to make the film vertical, and note the changes in the colour
 pattern as the film becomes thinner towards the top.<br>
 The colours seen in thin films come from the interference of the light
 waves reflected from the front and the back of the film.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="27.20H"></a>27.20 Electromagnetic radiation<br>
See: <a href="../commercial/Commercial3.html#Electromagnetism">Electromagnetism</a>, (Commercial).<br>
See: <a href="../commercial/Commercial2.html#UV">Ultraviolet radiation</a>, Vernier Pyrometer, Solar Power Meter, (Commercial).<br>

<a href="../periodictable/Table2.html#7.28">See Table 7.28: </a> Types of radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum<br>
 Electromagnetic radiation can travel through a vacuum.<br>
 Sunlight is electromagnetic radiation in all ranges.<br>
 Light is electromagnetic radiation in all ranges, having a wavelength
 from 10<sup>-7</sup> to 10<sup>-15 </sup>metres, including radio waves, 
 infrared radiation, 
 visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and Î³-radiation.<br>
 The original "microwaves" were 1 mm to 15 cm wave length as required 
by developments in radar during the Second World War.<br>
 In a narrow sense, light is only electromagnetic radiation in the visible
 range, having a wavelength from 400 manometers in the extreme violet to about 770 manometers in the extreme red.<br>
 Light is considered to show both particle and wave properties.<br>
 The fundamental particle or quantum of light is called the photon.<br>
 The velocity of light in a vacuum is c = 2.997 924 58 Ã 10<sup>8 </sup>m
 / s, or expressed in three significant figures, c = 3.00 Ã 10<sup>8</sup> 
 m / sec.<br>
 In transparent materials the speed of light is less than it is in a vacuum, 
 e.g. 225 000 km / s in water, 200 000 km / s in glass, 29 9711 km / s in air.<br>
 A medium in which the light velocity is low is called an optically dense
 medium.<br>
 Light can be produced by a physical change, e.g. heating of an object
 or a chemical change, e.g. burning of magnesium.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a href="../images/4.133x.gif">See diagram 4.133</a>: Electromagnetic radiation<br>
All electromagnetic radiation travels at the speed of light, c = 3 X 10<sup>8</sup> m s<sup>-1</sup>.<br>
The visible light spectrum has wavelengths 0.7 X 10<sup>-6</sup> metres, red, to 0.4 X 10<sup>-6</sup> metres, violet.<br>

 nm (1 nanometre = 10<sup>-9</sup> m):.<br>
 violet 390 to 425 nm, indigo 425 to 445 nm, blue 445 to 500 nm, green
 500 to 575 nm, yellow 575 to 590 nm, 
 orange 590 to 620 nm, red 620 to 780 nm.<br>
 The velocity of light in a vacuum, c = 3.00 X 10<sup>8</sup> m / second, but less in transparent materials: air 2.99 X 10<sup>8</sup> m / second, water 2.25 X 10<sup>8</sup> m / second, glass 2.00 X 10<sup>8</sup> m / second.<br>
 The microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum is from wavelengths
 1 m to 1 mm.<br>
 In Australia, microwave ovens operate at 12 cm wavelength, 2.45 gigahertz, 
 (GHz).<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="27.22H"></a>27.22 Gamma rays, Î³-rays<br>

 Gamma rays, Î³-rays, have shortest wavelength, highest frequency, most
 energy of any part of the electromagnetic spectrum.<br>
 They are ionizing radiation and so are hazardous, because they can kill cells and sterilize by killing pathogens.<br>
 They are produced by neutron stars, pulsars, supernova explosions, nuclear
 explosions on Earth, lightning, and radioactive decay of natural radioisotopes.<br>
 They are not reflected by mirrors, because their wavelengths are so short
 they pass through the space between most atoms.<br>
 However, when they collide with electrons in certain crystals, they scatter, 
 Compton scattering, and the slowed particles can be detected.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="27.23H"></a>27.23 X-rays<br>
 <b>Be careful</b>! X-rays should not be used in schools!<br>
 
 X-rays, Roentgen rays (discovered by Wilhelm RÃ¶ntgen, Germany, 1845 -1923), have very small wavelengths and act more like particles than waves.<br>
 X-rays are able to penetrate soft tissue. but not bone.<br>
 An X-ray image shows the bones as a shadow.<br>
 Bones and teeth, being more dense, absorb more X-rays than skin, so shadows
 of bones can be projected onto film.<br>
 They are used for customs and security detection, and testing pearls, 
 gemstones, old paintings, welding joints.<br>
 They kill cancer cells, but healthy tissue must be shielded from them.<br>
 X-rays are a form of electromagnetic energy with high energy. but very
 short wavelength, which can pass through many substances normally opaque to visible light.<br>
 The higher the frequency, i.e. the shorter the wavelength, the greater
 the penetrating power.<br>
 The lower the atomic weight of a substance the more easily X-rays can
 pass through it.<br>
 When X-rays pass through a human body, the fleshy parts produce a faint shadow on a photographic plate, the bones produce a darker shadow and any metal, e.g. a wedding ring, produces a very dark shadow.<br>
 When discovered in Germany in 1895, their origin was unknown so were called X, but also called roentgen rays.<br>
Experiments<br>
 Examine X-ray photographs.<br>
 1. Examine animal and human X-ray photographs over a light table.<br>
 If human X-ray photographs are cut into pieces, the students can practice
 reassembling them.<br>
2. Compare inner and outer structures of animals, 
 e.g. seashells, by comparing photographs with X-ray photographs.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="27.24H"></a>27.24 Ultraviolet rays<br>
 Ultraviolet rays from the Sun are subdivided into UV-A, UV-B, and UV-C.<br>
 UV-C rays are the most harmful. but are almost completely absorbed by 
the atmosphere.<br>
 UV-B rays cause sunburn and increase the risk of damage to DNA.<br>
 About 95 % of UV-B rays are absorbed by ozone in the Earth's atmosphere. but each year, a "hole" of thinning atmospheric ozone expands over Antarctica to exposing people increased levels of harmful UV rays.<br>
 Vitamin D is synthesized by people exposed to adequate sunlight.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="27.25H"></a>27.25 Visible light rays<br>
 Visible light rays, 4 Ã 10<sup>-7</sup> to 7 Ã 10<sup>-7</sup>
 m, can be analysed into a visible light spectrum.<br>

 See: <a href="../commercial/Commercial2.html#Waves">Waves</a>, microwave kit, (Commercial).<br>
 Microwaves are a form of high frequency radio waves as in AM and FM radio, but are much shorter.<br>
 A magnetron tube, the heart of the microwave oven, converts electricity into microwave energy.<br>
 From the magnetron tube, microwave energy is transmitted to the oven cavity through a small plastic-covered 
piece.<br>
 In the food, the microwaves are converted to heat, losing half their power every 2-3 cm.<br>
 Metals reflect microwave energy, but do not become hot.<br>
 Plastic, paper and glass transmit microwave energy, but do not become hot.<br>
 Food absorbs microwave energy, causing the water molecules in the food to vibrate.<br>
 Friction from the vibration produces heat energy and so causes the food to become hot.<br>
 Microwaves 1 Ã 10<sup>-3</sup> to 1 Ã 10<sup>-1</sup>m, generated
 by a magnetron in a microwave oven to cause vibration of molecules and speed cooking.<br>
A radio telescope can detect microwaves from distant stars seen by visible light.<br>
 The microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum is from wavelengths 1 m to 1 mm.<br>
 In Australia, microwave ovens operate at 12 cm wavelength.<br>
 Besides cooking, a microwave oven can be used to sterilize soil in potting
 mix, extract more juice from squeezed citrus fruit, liquidized. hard honey, warm damp plates and dry herbs and flowers.<br>
Small insects can survive in a microwave oven, but larger creatures, e.g. mice, cats, humans, can be killed by microwave oven radiation.<br>
The cause of death is the heating of the brainstem, which controls breathing, swallowing, and other autonomic physical reactions.<br>

 A coherer, Branly coherer (invented by Eduard Branly, 1844-1940, France), is a glass tube containing metal filings, which decrease in resistance to an electric current and so was used to detect radio waves.<br>
 The metal filings cohere to reduce resistance of the bulk filings.<br>
 By tapping the glass tube, the metal filings can be made to fall apart 
 or "decohere".<br>
 The on-off activity was used to transmit the first morse code signals.<br>
 Experiment.<br>
 Make a simple coherer by putting some iron filings into a cleaned-out narrow plastic tube reservoir from ballpoint and inserting screws in each end to act as electrodes.<br>
 Complete the circuit with a battery and an LED.<br>
 A signal from a transmitter, e.g. an auto ignition coil or a barbecue 
 piezo ignitor, turns on the LED, and tapping the coherer turns it off.<br>

 Diffraction is the curving of light around the edges of objects and the

 Single slit diffraction pattern is different from double slit interference.<br>
 Look at a vertical filament lamp through the slit formed by holding two fingers together.<br>
 A diffraction grating is a piece of plastic or glass with many opaque
 parallel lines rules on it, e.g. 100 lines per mm, 300 lines per mm, 
 1000 per mm, 13 500 lines per inch.<br>
 A diffraction grating with 15000 lines to the inch, mounted vertically 
 in the beam produces a brilliant spectrum.<br>
 When light rays enter the spectroscope, they are separated, according to different wavelengths, into a spectrum or spectra and produce an interference pattern are sharpened to appear as bright lines of reinforcement, (maxima).<br>
 Each element has its own characteristic bright lines on its spectrum so the spectroscope is used for chemical analysis.<br>
 Spectroscopes are also used in astronomy to determine the elements in the sun and stars, because it can produce separated line images for light sources with similar wavelengths.<br>
 The spectroscope invented by Joseph von Fraunhofer in 1820 used fine parallel wires.<br>

 Two point sources of "in phase" light produce an interference pattern of nodes and antinodes just like two point dippers dipping in phase into water of uniform depth in a ripple tank.<br>

 Directing parallel, monochromatic light at right angles to the top flat plate produces a series of parallel bands of maxima and minima when viewed

 Incoherent light have phase relationships that vary randomly.<br>
 A point source of coherent light illuminating the inner walls of a cylindrical
 tube causes interference fringes on a screen placed at the end of the tube.<br>
 The ring pattern from shining a point source down a reflecting

 Reflection of coherent light from a cylindrical glass tubing gives many
 interference fringes which extend around the tube for more than 180<sup>o</sup> from the incident beam direction.<br>
 These fringes have a spacing which varies with angle.<br>
 The cause of this interference pattern is the superposition of the reflections

 prism, to concentrate light from an oil lamp to form a beam.<br>
 This prism is still used in lighthouses around the world and in some

 See: <a href="../commercial/Commercial3.html#Ditems">Diffraction</a> (Commercial).<br>
 Diffraction causes images of closely-spaced objects to merge with the
 loss of individual detail, called poor resolution.<br>
 Increased magnification only produces a large image lacking in detail.<br>
 A diffraction grating has a high resolving power, so is used in analysis 
 of a spectrum, because it can produce separated line images for light sources with similar wavelengths.<br>
 The "resolving power", resolvance, of a device used to separate the wavelengths
 of light is as follows:.<br>
 R = Î» /delta Î», where delta Î» = smallest resolvable wavelength difference.<br>
 The two sodium "D-lines" are at 589.00 nm and 589.59 nm, so R = 589 /
 0.59 = 1000, the standard benchmark for the resolvance of a diffraction grating or spectrometer.<br>
 The resolving power of a microscope or telescope is a measure of its 
ability to produce separated images.<br>

 1. JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is the most common format 
for storing and transmitting photographic images on the World Wide Web.<br>
 The degree of compression can be adjusted, allowing a selectable trade-off
 between storage size and image quality, typically 10: 1 compression with little perceptible loss in image quality.<br>
 JPEG compression is used in a number of image file formats.<br>
 2. TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) format is a flexible format that normally
 saves 8 bits or 16 bits per colour (red, green, blue) for 24-bit and 48-bit totals, respectively.<br>
 TIFF image format is not widely supported by web browser.<br>
 The PNG (Portable Network Graphics) file format was created as the free, 
 open-source successor to the GIF.<br>
 The PNG file format supports true colour (16 million colours) while the
 GIF supports only 256 colours.<br>
 The PNG file excels when the image has large, uniformly coloured areas.<br>
 The loss less PNG format is best suited for editing pictures, and the
 glossy formats, like JPG, are best for the final distribution of photographic images, because JPG files are smaller than PNG files.<br>
 3. GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) is limited to an 8-bit palette, 
or 256 colours so is suitable for storing graphics with relatively few colours such as simple diagrams, shapes, logos and cartoon style images.<br>
 4. BMP file format (Windows bitmap) handles graphics files within the
 Microsoft Windows OS.<br>
 Typically, BMP files are uncompressed, hence they are large; the advantage
 is their simplicity and wide acceptance in Windows programs.<br>

<a href="../images/27.67.jpg">See diagram 27.67</a>: Light diffracting around a
 hair.<br>
 Babinet's Principle states that the diffraction pattern for an aperture
 is the same as the diffraction pattern for an opaque object of the same shape if illuminated in the same manner.<br>
 So the diffraction pattern from an opaque body is identical to diffraction
 pattern from a hole of the same size and shape except for forward beam intensity.<br>
 Except for the intensity of the central spot, the pattern produced by
 a diffracting opening of any shape is the same as the pattern produced by its conjugate.<br>
 A circular hole and a same-sided droplet will produce the same diffraction
 pattern.<br>
 Observing the diffraction from shining a laser through a smear of blood
 cells can be used to determine the size of the cells.<br>
 Babinet's Principle can be used to measure particles in the corona around
 the sun or moon and smog particles, and diffraction from a hair in a light beam.<br>
 Babinet's principle is used to find equivalence in size and shape, e.g.
 size of red blood cells by comparing diffraction pattern with an array of small holes.<br>
 Babinet's principle is used in slot antennas at frequencies between 300
 MHz and 24 GHz.<br>

 thin film to reduced reflection by destructive interference, so the lenses have a blue-purple colour.<br>
 Experiments<br>

<a href="../images/27.5.3.2.gif">See diagram 27.5.3.2</a>: Newton's rings with float glass.<br>
The origin of Newton's rings is similar to the fringes formed by the air wedge, except an upper glass plate is replaced by a curved piece of glass 
 with spherical cross section.<br>
The circular fringes become more closely spaced moving away from the centre of the pattern, because the distance between the upper curved surface 
 and lower flat surface increases faster with distance from the centre of the pattern.<br>
 A perfect lens can be tested, because the rings should be perfect circles.<br>
 Turn on the light.<br>
 The interference pattern is projected onto the side wall.<br>
 Change the pattern by tightening a screw on the edge of the glass disk.<br>
 2. Show interference of light by using float glass.<br>
 Float glass is produced by causing molten glass to spread over a bed 
of molten tin.<br>
 The stresses arise as the glass is allowed to cool and cut into slabs
 cause forms of curvature.<br>
 Use a slab of float glass illuminated by sodium light reflected from 
a white screen as in the diagram.<br>
 See the interference fringe patterns in the light reflected by the glass
 slabs.<br>
 See interference in transmitted light with the slabs in position AA'.<br>
 Note the complementary interference viewed in reflected and transmitted
 light.<br>

 Petrol and oil appears colourful when it contacts water.<br>
 They have lower density than water and do not mix with it so they sit
 on top forming a very thin film of petrol to spread out over the surface of the water.<br>
 A petrol film is so thin its thickness is almost the wavelength of the
 visible light spectrum.<br>
 Petrol is partially reflective leaving some light to be transmitted to the 
boundary with water which is also partially reflective.<br>
 The two reflected rays have different phases, so they may interfere destructively
 or constructively, or in between.<br>
 Total destructive interference is seen as a dark spot.<br>
 Total constructive interference is seen as bright spot radiating a colour
 with wavelength corresponding to the thickness of the film of petrol.<br>
 The film of petrol on water will appear colourful, the film does not 
have uniform thickness.<br>

 colours.<br>
 Dichroic lamps, jewellery, crystals, quinine iodosulfate, tourmaline.<br>
 Tourmaline, Al6B3Fe3H10NaO31Si6, (in Pegmatites), double refraction, contains about 10 % boron<br>
 Dichroism (Greek <i>dikhros</i> two colours) refers to substances that absorb
 light depending its direction or how much the substances are polarized.<br>
 So dichroic substances have a different colour when seen from
 different directions.<br>
 So dichroic jewellery has a reflected colour and a different transmitted
 colour.<br>
 As you look at it, the colours seem to change all the time.<br>
 Down lights, are usually halogen mirror reflector lamps, e.g. 12V 50W
 MR16 dichroic lamp, but these lamps are being ordered replaced by the Australian government, because of high energy usage.<br>
 Dichroic lamps have a coating on the reflectors of "multi-layer interference 
 films" that selectively reflect or transmit certain wavelengths of visible light, IR, and UV to reduce the heat in the beam.<br>
 Dichroic crystals present different colours by transmitted light, when viewed in two different directions, the colours being unlike in the direction of unlike or unequal axes.<br>
 They absorbs the component of wave polarized in a particular direction.<br>
Experiments<br>
 1. Hold a grid of parallel wires in a microwave beam and rotate the grid.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="27.170H"></a>27.170 Scattering, Rayleigh scattering, Mie scattering<br>
 Rayleigh scattering is scattering of light and other electromagnetic radiation by polarized particles smaller than the wavelength of light, e.g. gas molecules.<br>
 It is the main cause of the blue (blue-green hue) colour of the sky and the yellow colour of the sun where the shorter wavelengths of the spectrum, i.e. violet and blue, scatter more than the longer wavelengths.<br>
 So the hue of the sun from within the atmosphere is a red yellow, but redder near the horizon, caused by the remaining longer wavelengths, while the shorter wavelengths are scattered away.<br>
 Gas particles about the size of the wavelength of light cause Mie scattering to cause the white to grey colour of clouds.<br>
 Rayleigh scattering allows a laser beam to be seen at night.<br>
 Both Rayleigh scattering and Mie scattering are used to analyse solutions, gases and even biological tissue.<br>
Experiments<br>

 <a href="27.102.png">See diagram 27.102</a>: Mix primary colours.<br>
The primary colours, red, green and blue, cannot be produced from other colours of light, but they can be mixed by shining individual beams on a white screen so that they overlap to produce secondary colours.<br>
Red light + blue light gives secondary colour magenta.<br>
Blue light + green light gives secondary colour cyan (turquoise, peacock blue).<br>
Green light + red light gives secondary colour yellow.<br>
The three primary colours or the three secondary colour together give white light.<br>
Complimentary colours are colours that combine to form white light.<br>
Blue light + yellow light gives white light.<br>
Green light + magenta light gives white light.<br>
Red light + cyan light gives white light.<br>
Coloured lights are mixed by addition.<br>

See: <a href="../commercial/Commercial.html#Colour">Colourex</a> Pigments sorted by colour, (Commercial).<br>
<a href="27.108.png">Subtractive colour effect</a><br>
Pigments in paints and dyes reflect light of certain colours and absorb all the other colours.<br>
The primary colours of pigments, called subtractive primaries, are magenta, yellow, and cyan.<br>
When white light shines on coloured paint, only some of the wavelengths of light are reflected.<br>
Cyan paint absorbs red light. but reflects blue and green light.<br>
Yellow paint absorbs blue light. but reflects red and green light.<br>
If cyan paint is mixed with yellow paint, you see green paint, because both red and blue light are absorbed and only green light is reflected.<br>
Coloured pigments are mixed by subtraction.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="27.124H"></a>27.124 Dichromatism<br>
Resazurin, C12H7NO4, is dark blue when first added to the solution to be tested then becomes pale blue then becomes pink or purple on shaking.<br>
Resazurin has dichromatism (polychromatism), where the hue of the colour depends both on the concentration of the absorbing substance and the 
thickness of the medium the light passes through.<br
Viscous pumpkin seed oil, used as a salad dressing, contains about ten fatty acids, and has the strongest dichromatism, being dark green in thin layers to dark red in thick layers.<br>
Other dichromatic substances are bromophenol blue and resazurin.<br>

<a href="../images/28.220.gif">See diagram 28.220</a>: Colour of sunlight.<br>
 The rainbow consists of nearly circular arcs of colour with a common 
centre.<br>
 When you see a rainbow the sun is behind you and the common centre is
 in the direction to the sun.<br>
 Rain is falling in the direction of the rainbow.<br>
 When you see a rainbow, note the time and angle of elevation of the sun.<br>
 The rainbow is part of a circle with its centre below the horizon.<br>
 When the sun is higher than 42<sup>o</sup> the rainbow is completely 
below the horizon.<br>
 So a rainbow can be seen in the morning or afternoon. but not at midday.<br>
 Rainbows are usually seen about individual cumulus or cumulonimbus clouds
 that have gaps between them to allow sunlight to fall onto raindrops.<br>
 The sunlight enters the raindrops and reflect off the inside of the far
 surfaces to return towards the sun.<br>
 Different wavelengths reflect at different angles to split the spectrum.<br>
 The light from a rainbow comes towards the observer in the same way that
 sunlight reflections on the sea surface come towards the observer.<br>
 The sky within the rainbow appears brighter than outside it.<br>
 A secondary dimmer rainbow with reverse order of colours may appear within
 the primary rainbow.<br>
 A dark region between the primary and secondary rainbows is called Alexander's
 dark band.<br>
 Rainbows are seen in fogs, fog bows, when sunlight from behind the observer
 passes through a break in the fog.<br>
 Also a rainbow may be seen from an aircraft window when looking down 
on the shadow of the aircraft on cloud below.<br>
 A corona may be observed around the moon consisting of a central white
 disc wider than the moon with a faint spectrum ring of colour around it.<br>
Experiments<br>
 1. Use a shallow dish of water to form a spectrum on the wall or on a
 screen.<br>
 The light from the sun has to first pass through the water then be reflected
 back on the wall by the mirror.<br>
 This experiment needs very fine adjustment to the angle of the mirror.<br>
 Also, the spectrum forms only when the water is still so careful adjustment 
 and patience is needed!.<br>

 White light can be separated into the seven colours of the spectrum:

<a href="../images/36.101.gif">See diagram 36.101</a>: Shoe box spectroscope.<br>
 By using a sensitive instrument called a spectroscope, scientists are
 often able to analyse the composition of materials located a great distance away.<br>
 The spectroscope has been used to determine the composition of the Sun
 and other stars and of the atmosphere of many of the planets.<br>
 Spacemen in the future will use this kind of device to analyse the chemical
 composition of their immediate surroundings.<br>
 Light entering a spectroscope is split up by a diffraction grating to
 form coloured bands, a spectrum.<br>
 Since each chemical element shows certain characteristic bright shoe 
box spectroscope lines in its spectrum the material can thus be 
 easily identified.<br>
Experiments<br>
 The materials required are a shoe box, replica grating, see science supply
 catalogues, some masking tape, and a double edged razor blade broken in two.<br>
 Cut a hole of about 2 cm diameter in the middle of one end of the box.<br>
 Use tape to fix a piece of replica grating over the hole from the inside.<br>
 Cut a 2.5 cm Ã 0.5 cm slit, which should be parallel to the lines of 
the grating, in the middle of the other end.<br>
 Cover the slit from the outside with a finer slit made from two halves of a razor blade, edges
 facing each other.<br>
 The two halves are held together and fixed to the box with tape.<br>
 The width of the slit should be about the same as the thickness of a razor 
blade and is finally adjusted for the best results, see diagram.<br>
 Look through the spectroscope at various luminous gases such as neon 
and argon in lamps or signs.<br>
 Notice the bright lines in the spectrum, which indicate that each element
 has its own pattern.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="27.195H"></a>27.195 Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy, (AAS)<br>
 Atomic absorption spectroscopy, AAS, is used to determine the composition
 of inorganic elements in a sample.<br>
 AAS works on the principles of atomizing a sample and quantitatively determining the concentration of atoms in the gas phase by measuring the 
 intensity of light absorbed by them when they are irradiated with electromagnetic radiation.<br>
 A key aspect of AAS is the method used to atomize the sample, which also
 affects the sensitivity of the technique.<br>
 Methods include flame, graphite furnace, electro-thermal, plasma furnace, 
 and vapour-hydride atomization.<br>
 Chemicals prepared for AAS work are called AAS solutions.<br>
 Spectroscopy does destroy samples, but the interfering parts must be 
removed.<br>
 In AAS analysis for trace metals in blood, biopsy or plant material, 
the sample tissue must first be digested, usually with perchloric acid or nitric acid.<br>

 The brain is said to "average" wavelengths of light seen record a colour.<br>
 Mixed red light and green light is seen as yellow light.<br>
