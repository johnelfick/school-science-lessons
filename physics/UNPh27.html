<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="27.2.1H">27.2.1</a> Babinet's principle of diffraction<br>
<a href="../images/27.6.4.jpg">See diagram 27.6.4</a>: Light diffracting around a hair.<br>
 Babinet's Principle states that the diffraction pattern for an aperture is the same as the diffraction pattern for an opaque object of the same shape if illuminated in the same manner.<br>
 So the diffraction pattern from an opaque body is identical to diffraction pattern from a hole of the same size and shape except for forward beam intensity.<br>
 Except for the intensity of the central spot, the pattern produced by a diffracting opening of any shape is the same as the pattern produced by its conjugate.<br>
 A circular hole and a same-sided droplet will produce the same diffraction pattern.<br>
 Observing the diffraction from shining a laser through a smear of blood cells can be used to determine the size of the cells.<br>
 Babinet's Principle can be used to measure particles in the corona around the sun or moon and smog particles, and diffraction from a hair in a light beam.<br>
 Babinet's principle is used to find equivalence in size and shape, e.g. size of red blood cells by comparing diffraction pattern with an array of small holes.<br>
 Babinet's principle is used in slot antennas at frequencies between 300 MHz and 24 GHz.<br>
Experiments<br>
 1. Put a 0.1 mm wire into a laser beam and note the diffraction pattern.<br>
 Note the diffraction pattern when the laser is shone through a narrow slit.<br>
 Make the slit with 1. a laser printer, 2. a photocopier then print on clear plastic film, 3. a pin to draw a line on a piece of smoked glass from a candle flame.<br>
 2. Draw black spots on white paper, reduced them photographically, and use the positive and negative copies as complementary arrays.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="27.2.2H">27.2.2</a> Diffraction in a ripple tank<br>
 Diffraction occurs when a straight wave passes through a narrow gap.<br>
 The waves spread at the edge of obstacles, e.g. edges of a gap, and curve in behind an isolated obstacle.<br>
 Experiments<br>
1. Note diffraction when a wave hits two barriers separated by a gap of about 1 cm or less.<br>
 Place the barriers 5 cm from the source of vibration, the vibrating beam.<br>
 Block off the outer end of the barriers with side barriers.<br>
 Increase the width of the gap to about 10 cm and note less diffraction.<br>
 Put weights on the barriers if they start to vibrate.<br>
2. Repeat the experiment with two equally separated gaps.<br>
 Increase the width of the gap and note less diffraction.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="27.2.3H">27.2.3</a> Diffraction of light<br>
Diffraction of light, diffraction grating, spectroscope<br>
 Diffraction is the curving of light around the edges of objects and the  consequent spreading of light when it passes through narrow gaps.<br>
 Single slit diffraction pattern is different from double slit interference.<br>
 Look at a vertical filament lamp through the slit formed by holding two fingers together.<br>
 A diffraction grating is a piece of plastic or glass with many opaque parallel lines rules on it, 
 e.g. 100 lines per mm, 300 lines per mm, 1000 per mm, 13 500 lines per inch.<br>
 A diffraction grating with 15000 lines to the inch, mounted vertically in the beam produces a brilliant spectrum.<br>
 When light rays enter the spectroscope, they are separated, according to different wavelengths, into a spectrum or spectra.<br>
 They produce an interference pattern sharpened to appear as bright lines of reinforcement, (maxima).<br>
 Each element has its own characteristic bright lines on its spectrum so the spectroscope is used for chemical analysis.<br>
 Spectroscopes are also used in astronomy to determine the elements in the sun and stars.<br>
They can be used to produce separated line images for light sources with similar wavelengths.<br>
 The spectroscope, invented by Joseph von Fraunhofer in 1820, used fine parallel wires.<br>

<a href="../images/28.134.2.gif">See diagram 28.134.2</a>: Diffraction grating<br>
Experiments<br>
1. A slide projector is directed towards the front of the lecture theatre.<br>
 A diffraction grating with 15000 lines to the inch is mounted vertically in the beam producing a brilliant spectrum in the region shown.<br>
2. Make a diffraction grating by drawing evenly-spaced clear black lines on a white card.<br>
 Then take a high quality black and white photograph using a camera stand.<br>
 Use the negative for a diffraction grating.<br>
 However, you can also purchase cheap diffraction gratings as novelty spectacles, sometimes called "rainbow glasses".<br>
3. Hold a feather near your eye and observe a burning candle far from you.<br>
 Adjust the distance of feather from your eye until you see four X-shaped colour bands.<br>
 You may also see two blue and two red bands in each of the four bands.<br>
4. Stretch nylon gauze or a woman's fine scarf tightly and observe a burning candle through it.<br>
 See colour stripes appearing in the direction of the fibres.<br>
 Different weaving and different shapes of small holes will affect different shape of the stripes.<br>
 You may see an X-shaped diffraction pattern through some types of nylon gauze.<br>
5. Make a spectrum without a prism.<br>
 Set a tray of water in bright sunlight.<br>
 Lean a rectangular pocket mirror against an inside edge with the lower part immersed in the water.<br>
 Adjust the mirror so that a spectrum appears on the wall.<br>
6. Pass light through a spherical flask of water 
and view the rainbow on a screen placed between the light and the flask.<br>
7. Cut a 2 cm diameter round hole at one end of a cardboard shoe box.<br>
 Attach a diffraction grating across the hole on the inside of the box.<br>
 Note the direction of the slit on the grating.<br>
 In the opposite side of the box, cut a 0.5 cm × 4.5 cm slit opposite the diffraction grating, with the longer side horizontal.<br>
 Attach two razor blades to the outside of the slit, almost edge to edge, to form a very narrow vertical slit.<br>
 Place a 12 V vertical filament lamp, e.g. a neon lamp or argon lamp, in front of the slit.<br>
 Adjust the distance between the two razor blades so that you may see clear linear spectrums when you look through the round hole.<br>
 Use the diffraction grating and a sharp source of light to see the order of colours in the spectrum.<br>
 ROYGBIV, represents red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.<br>
 Note the bright lines in spectra produced by fluorescent mercury lamps and neon signs.<br>
8. Make a drink-can spectroscope.<br>
 Tape a replica grating over the hole cut a slit in the bottom.<br>
 Make a slit in the cover of a film canister and place a grating over a hole in the bottom made with a No. 2 cork bore.<br>
9. View a motor car headlamp through a small square of silk to observe two-dimensional grating diffraction interference.<br>
10. Train yourself to see speckle patterns in unfiltered sun diffraction interference scattered by a diffusing surface.<br>
11. Use a diffraction grating in air and water.<br>
 Measure the pattern of a laser beam incident on a diffraction grating placed inside an empty aquarium and with it full of water.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="27.2.4H">27.2.4</a> Random multiple gratings interference<br>
 Exhale on clean glass to produce random multiple gratings of water droplets.<br>
 Look through a drop of blood on a microscope slide at a point source or project onto a screen from a point source.<br>
 Dust a bathroom mirror and hold a small light as close to the eye as possible.<br>
 Pass a collimated beam of white light through a glass dusted with Lycopodium powder.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="27.2.5H">27.2.5</a> Resolution of diffraction grating<br>
 Diffraction causes images of closely-spaced objects to merge with the loss of individual detail, called poor resolution.<br>
 Increased magnification only produces a large image lacking in detail.<br>
 A diffraction grating has a high resolving power, so is used in analysis of a spectrum, because it can produce separated line images for light sources
 with similar wavelengths.<br>
 The "resolving power", resolvance, of a device used to separate the wavelengths of light is as follows:.<br>
 R = λ /delta λ, where delta λ = smallest resolvable wavelength difference.<br>
 The two sodium "D-lines" are at 589.00 nm and 589.59 nm, so R = 589 / 0.59 = 1000, the standard benchmark for the resolvance of a diffraction grating
 or spectrometer.<br>
 The resolving power of a microscope or telescope is a measure of its ability to produce separated images.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="27.2.6H">27.2.6</a> Single slit diffraction and double slit diffraction<br>
 <a href="../images/27.31.gif">See diagram 27.31</a>: Single slit diffraction pattern.<br>
 <a href="../images/27.6.1.jpg">See diagram 27.6.1</a>: Double slit diffraction.<br>
 <a href="../images/27.86.1.jpg">See diagram27.86.1</a>: Single slit diffraction.<br>
 <a href="../images/27.86.2.jpg">See diagram 27.86.2</a>: Double slit diffraction.<br>
 Diffraction is both the curving of light around the edges of objects and the spreading of light when it passed through a narrow slit.<br>
 The pattern of single slit diffraction is different from double slit diffraction in that the central reinforcement is twice as wide as all the
 other reinforcements and also the intensity of light regions diminishes at places further away from the central reinforcement.<br>
 For any nodal point in the single slit diffraction pattern, sin θ= n λ / ω = x / L, where n = the number of the nodal lines.<br>
 Experiments<br>
 1. Adjustable single slit<br>
 Look through a vernier caliper towards a monochromatic light 5 to 10 m distance.<br>
 Look at a filament through a dark plate with a line scratched in it.<br>
 2. Single and double slits<br>
 Rule single and double lines on a photographic plate.<br>
 Look at a line filament covered with half red and half blue filters.<br>
 3. Single and double slit projected<br>
 Focus a slit on the wall and place photographic plates with slits near the lens.<br>
 For the single slit parallel lines are unevenly spaced.<br>
 For the parallel slit pairs of lines of equal spacing are randomly spaced.<br>
 4. Turn on the laser.<br>
 The pattern appears on the wall.<br>
 The slit widths and spacing are printed on the slide.<br>
 To select different slits, slide the holder sideways.<br>
 A Cornell slit film card includes double slits of increasing width and spacing.<br>
 5. Turn on the laser and place the slit slide in 
 front of the beam so the beam hits one of the many slits on the slide.<br>
 View the results of the interference pattern on the wall.<br>
 The lights in the room may need to be darkened.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="27.2.7H">27.2.7</a> Speckle spots and random diffraction interference<br>
 The sparkling of a spot illuminated by a laser beam on the wall is caused by random interference patterns caused by scattered light speckle spots and
 random diffraction.<br>
 Speckle patterns in arc light interference<br>
 Speckle patterns can also be seen in arc lamp light.<br>
 The patterns disappear as the object is brought closer to the arc.<br>

Light passed through oppositely-pointed crown and flint glass prisms adjusted to give light deviated in two directions. but with no dispersion.<br>
Light passes through prisms of crown and flint glass adjusted to give two beams of the same dispersion. but different deviation.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="27.3.3H">27.3.3</a> Dispersion curve of a prism<br>
Light passes through a grating and then through a second slit at right angles and a prism generating a dispersion curve in colour on the screen.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="27.3.4H">27.3.4</a> Dispersion of fuchsin and sodium<br>
When salt is heated on a flame in the path of a narrow beam of light before dispersion the edges of the spectrum close to the dark band bend up or down.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="27.3.5H">27.3.5</a> Liquid cell absorption dispersion<br>
 An absorbing solution is placed in a liquid cell placed in a beam of light before dispersion.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="27.3.6H">27.3.6</a> Scattering<br>
Scattering, Rayleigh scattering, Mie scattering<br>
 Rayleigh scattering is scattering of light and other electromagnetic radiation by polarized particles smaller than the wavelength of light, e.g. gas molecules.<br>
 It is the main cause of the blue (blue-green hue) colour of the sky and the yellow colour of the sun where the shorter wavelengths of the spectrum, i.e. violet and blue,
 scatter more than the longer wavelengths.<br>
 So the hue of the sun from within the atmosphere is a red yellow, but redder near the horizon, caused by the remaining longer wavelengths,
 while the shorter wavelengths are scattered away.<br>
 Gas particles about the size of the wavelength of light cause Mie scattering to cause the white to grey colour of clouds.<br>
 Rayleigh scattering allows a laser beam to be seen at night.<br>
 Both Rayleigh scattering and Mie scattering are used to analyse solutions, gases and even biological tissue.<br>
Experiments<br>
 1. Red and blue beam.<br>
 Pass a red beam is passed through a solution of gum mastic, but a blue beam does not pass through it.<br>
 2. Colour of smoke.<br>
 Cigarette smoke is blue. but after exhaling is white.<br>
 3. Note multiple scattering in darkening of wet sand and whiteness of milk.<br>
 4. Dust halos.<br>
 A glass plate covered with dust is held in a beam that converges into a hole in a screen.<br>
 Circular halos appear on the screen around the hole.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="27.3.7H">27.3.7</a> Radio waves and TV waves<br>
 Radio and TV waves, &gt; 1 × 10-1m, have longest wavelength and lowest frequency, radar  (radio detection and ranging) microwaves used for 
 detection position of distant objects, e.g. aircraft.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="27.4.1H">27.4.1</a> Electromagnetic radiation<br>
<a href="../images/28.133.gif">See diagram 28.133</a>: Electromagnetic spectrum<br>
Types of radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum<br>
 Electromagnetic radiation can travel through a vacuum.<br>
 Sunlight is electromagnetic radiation in all ranges.<br>
 Light is electromagnetic radiation in all ranges, having a wavelength from 10-7 to 10-15 metres.<br>
They include radio waves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and γ-radiation.<br>
 The original "microwaves" were 1 mm to 15 cm wave length as required by developments in radar during the Second World War.<br>
 Light is electromagnetic radiation in the visible range, with a wavelength from 700 nanometres for red light to 400 nanometres for violet light.<br>
(1 nanometre, nm = 0.000000001 m)<br>
 Light is considered to show both particle and wave properties.<br>
 The fundamental particle or quantum of light is called the photon.<br>
 The velocity of light in a vacuum is c = 2.997 924 58 × 108 m / s, or expressed in three significant figures, c = 3.00 × 108 
 m / sec.<br>
 In transparent materials the speed of light is less than it is in a vacuum, e.g. 225 000 km / s in water, 200 000 km / s in glass, 29 9711 km / s in air.<br>
 A medium in which the light velocity is low is called an optically dense medium.<br>
 Light can be produced by a physical change, e.g. heating of an object or a chemical change, e.g. burning of magnesium.<br>
<a href="../images/27.133x.gif">See diagram 27.133x</a>: Electromagnetic radiation<br>
All electromagnetic radiation travels at the speed of light, c = 3 X 108 m s-1.<br>

 A coherer, Branly coherer (invented by Eduard Branly, 1844-1940, France), is a glass tube containing metal filings.<br>
 It decreases in resistance to an electric current and so was used to detect radio waves.<br>
 The metal filings cohere to reduce resistance of the bulk filings.<br>
 By tapping the glass tube, the metal filings can be made to fall apart or "decohere".<br>
 The on-off activity was used to transmit the first morse code signals.<br>
 Experiment.<br>
 Make a simple coherer by putting some iron filings into a cleaned-out narrow plastic tube reservoir from a ballpoint pen.<br>
Inserting screws in each end to act as electrodes.<br>
 Complete the circuit with a battery and an LED.<br>
 A signal from a transmitter, e.g. an auto ignition coil or a barbecue piezo ignitor, turns on the LED, and tapping the coherer turns it off.<br>

 Gamma rays, γ-rays, have shortest wavelength, highest frequency, most energy of any part of the electromagnetic spectrum.<br>
 They are ionizing radiation and so are hazardous, because they can kill cells and sterilize by killing pathogens.<br>
 They are produced by neutron stars, pulsars, supernova explosions, nuclear explosions on Earth, lightning, and radioactive decay of natural radioisotopes.<br>
 They are not reflected by mirrors, because their wavelengths are so short they pass through the space between most atoms.<br>
 However, when they collide with electrons in certain crystals, they scatter.<br>

 Microwaves are a form of high frequency radio waves as in AM and FM radio, but are much shorter.<br>
 A magnetron tube, the heart of the microwave oven, converts electricity into microwave energy.<br>
 From the magnetron tube, microwave energy is transmitted to the oven cavity through a small plastic-covered piece.<br>
 In the food, the microwaves are converted to heat, losing half their power every 2-3 cm.<br>
 Metals reflect microwave energy, but do not become hot.<br>
 Plastic, paper and glass transmit microwave energy, but do not become hot.<br>
 Food absorbs microwave energy, causing the water molecules in the food to vibrate.<br>
 Friction from the vibration produces heat energy and so causes the food to become hot.<br>
 Microwaves 1 × 10-3 to 1 × 10-1m, generated by a magnetron in a microwave oven.<br>
It causes vibration of molecules and speed cooking.<br>

 The microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum is from wavelengths 1 m to 1 mm.<br>
 In Australia, microwave ovens operate at 12 cm wavelength.<br>
 Besides cooking, a microwave oven can be used to sterilize soil in potting  mix, extract more juice from squeezed citrus fruit, liquidized. 
hard honey, warm damp plates and dry herbs and flowers.<br>
Small insects can survive in a microwave oven, but larger creatures, e.g. mice, cats, humans, can be killed by microwave oven radiation.<br>
The cause of death is the heating of the brainstem, which controls breathing, swallowing, and other autonomic physical reactions.<br>
1. The four basic methods of cooking are as follows:<br>
* Wet heating: boiling, steaming, pasteurization 100  oC. to 120  oC,<br>
* Dry heating: baking, roasting, up to 250  oC,<br>
* Hot oil frying, up to 300  oC,<br>
* Microwave cooking, up to 120  oC.<br>
The temperature of meat in a microwave oven is never above 100  oC, so no maillard reaction can occur.<br>

 UV-B rays cause sunburn and increase the risk of damage to DNA.<br>
 About 95 % of UV-B rays are absorbed by ozone in the Earth's atmosphere, but each year, a "hole" of thinning atmospheric

 <b>Be careful</b>! X-rays should not be used in schools!<br>
 X-rays, Roentgen rays (discovered by Wilhelm Röntgen, Germany, 1845 -1923), have very small wavelengths and act more like particles than waves.<br>
 X-rays are able to penetrate soft tissue. but not bone.<br>
 An X-ray image shows the bones as a shadow.<br>
 Bones and teeth, being more dense, absorb more X-rays than skin, so shadows of bones can be projected onto film.<br>
 They are used for customs and security detection, and testing pearls, gemstones, old paintings, welding joints.<br>
 They kill cancer cells, but healthy tissue must be shielded from them.<br>
 X-rays are a form of electromagnetic energy with high energy. but very short wavelength, which can pass through many substances normally opaque to visible light.<br>
 The higher the frequency, i.e. the shorter the wavelength, the greater the penetrating power.<br>
 The lower the atomic weight of a substance the more easily X-rays can pass through it.<br>
 When X-rays pass through a human body, the fleshy parts produce a faint shadow on a photographic plate, the bones produce a darker shadow and any metal, 
e.g. a wedding ring, produces a very dark shadow.<br>
 When discovered in Germany in 1895, their origin was unknown so were called X, but also called roentgen rays.<br>

 1. JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is the most common format for storing and transmitting photographic images on the World Wide Web.<br>
 The degree of compression can be adjusted, allowing a selectable trade-off between storage size and image quality, typically 10: 1 compression with little perceptible loss in image quality.<br>
 JPEG compression is used in a number of image file formats.<br>
 2. TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) format is a flexible format that normally saves 8 bits or 16 bits per colour (red, green, blue) for 24-bit and 48-bit totals, respectively.<br>
 TIFF image format is not widely supported by web browser.<br>
 The PNG (Portable Network Graphics) file format was created as the free, open-source successor to the GIF.<br>
 The PNG file format supports true colour (16 million colours) while the GIF supports only 256 colours.<br>
 The PNG file excels when the image has large, uniformly coloured areas.<br>
 The loss less PNG format is best suited for editing pictures, and the glossy formats, like JPG, are best for the final distribution of photographic images, because JPG files are smaller than PNG files.<br>
 3. GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) is limited to an 8-bit palette, or 256 colours so is suitable for storing graphics with relatively few colours such as simple diagrams, shapes, logos and cartoon style images.<br>
 4. BMP file format (Windows bitmap) handles graphics files within the Microsoft Windows OS.<br>
 Typically, BMP files are uncompressed, hence they are large; the advantage is their simplicity and wide acceptance in Windows programs.<br>

Young's two-slit experiment.<br>
 Two point sources of "in phase" light produce an interference pattern of nodes and antinodes just like two point dippers dipping in phase into water of uniform depth in a ripple tank.<br>
 The shorter the wavelength, the more closely crammed is the interference pattern so the pattern for violet light is more crammed than the pattern for red light.<br>
 1. For any point in the pattern observed, sin θ = (path difference / d) = (x / L).<br>
 2. For any nodal point in the pattern observed, sin θ = (n - 1/2) λ / d = (x / L).<br>
 3. The bright bars in the interference pattern observed, and the nodes, are uniformly spaced, x.<br>
 x = Lλ / d.<br>
 4. The shorter the wavelength, the more closely crammed is the interference pattern.<br>

 The ring pattern from shining a point source down a reflecting cylindrical tube results from interference of two virtual sources.<br>
 Reflection of coherent light from a cylindrical glass tubing gives many interference fringes which extend around the tube for more than 180o from the incident beam direction.<br>
 These fringes have a spacing which varies with angle.<br>
 The cause of this interference pattern is the superposition of the reflections from the outer and inner surfaces of the cylinder.<br>

The circular fringes become more closely spaced moving away from the centre of the pattern, because the distance between the upper curved surface

 Rayleigh scattering is scattering of light and other electromagnetic radiation by polarized particles smaller than the wavelength of light, e.g. gas molecules.<br>
 It is the main cause of the blue (blue-green hue) colour of the sky and the yellow colour of the sun where the shorter wavelengths of the spectrum, i.e. violet and blue, 
 scatter more than the longer wavelengths.<br>
 So the hue of the sun from within the atmosphere is a red yellow, but redder near the horizon, caused by the remaining longer wavelengths, while the shorter
 wavelengths are scattered away.<br>
 Gas particles about the size of the wavelength of light cause Mie scattering to cause the white to grey colour of clouds.<br>
 Rayleigh scattering allows a laser beam to be seen at night.<br>
 Both Rayleigh scattering and Mie scattering are used to analyse solutions, gases and even biological tissue.<br>

 Microwaves are reflected by metals so the walls of the microwave oven are made of stainless steel or epoxy coated stainless steel.<br>
The microwaves can bounce around the inside and not escape into the kitchen.<br>
 Food is usually heated on a revolving turntable to produce an even heating and avoid hot spots and cold spots.<br>
 The holes in the steel door are too small to let the microwaves pass through.<br>
 Microwaves are transmitted by paper, glass and some plastics that do not absorb microwave energy and do not become hot.<br>
 Microwaves are absorbed by food containing moisture.<br>
2. Microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum is from frequency 300 MHz, wavelength 1 m, to 300 000 MHz, wavelength 1 mm.<br>
Australia and UK, microwave ovens operate at 2450 MHz (Class B / Group 2, ISM equipment Standard CISPR11), wavelength 12 cm.<br>
In other places, the microwave oven wavelength may be 12.24 cm.<br>
This is a lower frequency and lower energy than ionizing radiation.<br>
For safety reasons, when the microwave door is opened, switches must cut the power.<br>
The power flux density of microwave radiation should not exceed 50 W / M2 at any point 5 cm or more from the oven external surface<br>
The inside of a microwave oven is coated with metal that acts like a Faraday cage and reflects the microwaves (radio waves).<br>
3. Microwave radiation is generated in an electronic tube called a magnetron.<br>
 High voltage emits electrons from a heated cathode that are diverted by magnets to spin in a circular orbit.<br>
This causes metal plates to resonate and emit microwaves to be conducted into the interior space of a microwave oven.<br>
 The patterns of more intense radiation can be seen by placing thermal paper used for thermographic imaging at different heights in the oven.<br>
 However, the same thermal paper placed on the turning turntable, (carousel), shows a more equal distribution of the radiation.<br>
4. Water molecules are electric dipoles with a positive charge at one end and a negative charge at the other end.<br>
They spin when they align with the alternating electric fields in the microwave oven.<br>
 However, a block of dry ice is not melted in a microwave oven, because the carbon dioxide molecule is not a dipole.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="27.8.2H">27.8.2</a> Microwave containers<br>
 Microwave cooking containers should not absorb the radiation.<br>
 They should be made from material with low polarity, i.e. low dielectric constant and low dissipation factor at 2450 MHz.<br>
 The material should be stable at high temperature and have good resistance to oil vapour, e.g. polystyrene and certain glass.<br>
 Never use metal containers or plates decorated with metal leaf in microwave ovens.<br>
Microwaves cannot pass through metal and may be reflected to damage the magnetron.<br>
 Remove meal foil packaging and twisted ties or tags.<br>
 Do not use dishes with metallic rims, cups with glued-on handles, delicate glassware, cut glass vases, jars with metal lids.<br>
 However, you can use metal foil to protect food that might overcook in some areas.<br>
 Do not cook in plastic food storage bags, because they may melt.<br>
 However, "GLAD WRAP" may be used to cover dishes, but do not remove it immediately after cooking.<br>
 Do not use brown paper bags or newspaper, because they contain metallic impurities that may cause blue spark arcing and damage the oven.<br>
 Do not put mercury thermometers in the microwave oven.<br>
 Do not put a wet cat in the microwave oven.<br>
 Use containers labelled "microwave oven safe".<br>
 Use shallow round dishes, because microwaves penetrate only 2 to 3 cm into most food.<br>
 Food in the corners or dishes with corners will receive more energy and probably overcook.<br>
 Arrange food containers in a ring at outside of the rotating turntable.<br>
 Put the container containing thin food on top of another container on the turntable to get more bounce of microwaves through the food.<br>
 Remember that if food is not cooked through, e.g. poultry, then bacteria may remain unharmed inside.<br>
 Examples of microwave cooking containers:<br>
* "Starmaid" baking dish, plastic, 1 litre with lid, 190 mm × 170 mm × 68 mm.<br>
* "Décor Thermoglass", for conventional ovens and microwaves, with microwave safe lid with a steam release vent, 1 litre.<br>
* Microsafe milk heating jug, "Microsafe" jug has cone-shaped lid if it boils, the milk flows up though the cone, safely back into the jug.<br>
* Melamine crockery, green, virtually unbreakable, dishwasher safe.<br>
Not suitable for microwave oven, plate, 18 mm diameter.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="27.8.3H">27.8.3</a> Microwave cooking<br>
 Microwave cooking occurs, because water is a strong absorber of microwaves, so the water in food boils and turns to steam.<br>
 In a normal oven, a range of black body radiation is generated, but only some longer sections of this radiation are absorbed by food.<br>
 The radiation penetrates the surface of the food for about one wavelength for infrared heat radiation &lt; 1 / 10 mm.<br>
 Only the outside of the food is directly affected and the inside of the food is heated by conduction.<br>
 The 12 cm wavelength microwaves penetrate deeper into the food.<br>
 Avoid exploding food, e.g. tomatoes, apples, by cutting into them before microwave cooking.<br>
 Avoid dry food with spikes or sharp corners, e.g. pieces of sweet potato or broccoli, because electrical arcing may occur between the spikes<br>
This may cause charring of the food.<br>
 Elevate the cooking pan in the microwave oven to allow more bounce of microwaves up from the floor of the microwave oven to get even cooking.<br>
 Microwaves are not used for defrosting, because ice has few free molecules of water to be excited by the microwaves.<br>
 If ice cubes are dried with a tea towel and placed in a microwave oven, they still feel cold after being mirowaved.<br> 
Microwave ovens do not heat food by operating at a special resonance of water molecules in the food.<br>
A microwave oven could operate at many frequencies.<br>
The 22 GHz resonant frequency of isolated water molecules has a wavelength too short to penetrate common foodstuffs to useful depths.<br>
The typical oven frequency of 2.45 GHz was chosen partly due to its ability to penetrate a food object of reasonable size.<br>, 
Microwave ovens do not cook food from the inside out, because 2.45 GHz microwaves can only penetrate approximately 1 cm into most foods.<br>
The inside portions of thicker foods are mainly heated by heat conducted from the outer portions.<br>
Microwave ovens cannot cause cancer, because as microwave radiation is non-ionizing radiation.<br>
 Do microwaves make food radioactive?<br>
 The energy of a microwave photon in a microwave oven is 0.00001 eV.<br>
 The but the minimum ionization energy of common chemical substances is about 0.01 eV.<br>
 So microwave ovens do not cause chemical changes from radiating food.<br>
 Photons in an infra-red oven are much higher energy, but energy required to change a nucleus to make food "radioactive" is many powers of ten higher.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="27.8.4H">27.8.4</a> Microwave oven superheating<br>
When tap water is heated on a stove top, the maximum superheating is 100.75  oC..<br>
 However, in a microwave oven, superheating temperatures of 105  oC. to 110  oC. can occur.<br>
 The microwave oven heats the water directly and the container indirectly.<br>
 This is the opposite of what happens when heating a container of water on a stove.<br>
 In the microwave oven, the water is not heated near the beaker surface where nucleation is most likely to occur.<br>
 Evaporation occurs only at the water surface and is not fast enough to cool the bulk water.<br>
 There is much less superheating in plastic cups, because water does not wet plastic and many more nucleation sites are available for boiling.<br>
 It is dangerous to put a cup of still water in the microwave oven<br>
 When you try to remove the cup nucleation may occur and the water boils, forms bubbles and steam, and may scold your hand.<br>
 To avoid the delayed eruptive boiling of liquids after cooking, leave to stand for at least 20 seconds before removing food or liquids from the oven.<br>
 This delay allows for some cooling and more even distribution of heat.<br>
 If a plastic fork or tea bag is placed in the liquid before the oven is turned on, they provide nucleation sites for boiling to occur, so no superheating.<br>
 Experiments<br>
 1. Test a container for potential microwave oven use.<br>
 Fill a one cup glass measure with water and put it in the microwave oven alongside the container to be tested, e.g. a ceramic dish.<br>
 Heat for on high for 60 seconds.<br>
 If the container is microwave oven safe, it will remain cool, but the water should be hot.<br>
 However, you cannot use this test on plastic containers that must be labelled microwave "oven safe".<br>
 2. Cook a potato for 2 minutes then cut it open to see the translucent areas finger-like regions extending from the outside.<br> 
 This is where the potato has been heated above 60  oC..<br>
 This show that microwave ovens do not provide a uniform density of microwave energy.<br>
 So "hot spots" and "cold" spots may exist in microwave ovens, unlike the conventional oven.<br>
 This phenomenon is the reason cooks suggest leaving food cooked by microwaves to "stand" for some time after cooking.<br>
This delay allows the temperature to equalize in the food.<br>
 3. Compare popcorn cooked in the microwave with popcorn cooked on the conventional stove.<br>
 Use the same number of corn (maize) grains and later count the number of unpopped grains.<br>
 Carefully open popcorn bags away from your face!.<br>
 4. Do not put sealed tins or glass jars in a microwave oven, e.g. babies bottles fitted with a screw cap.<br>
 Remove food from tin cans.<br>
 If boiling liquids in a microwave oven use a wide moth container.<br>
 Also, puncture skins of potatoes, apples, sausages and oysters to allow steam to escape.<br>
 Food with a high fat content, e.g. sausage roils, may catch fire if overcooked.<br>
 5. Eggs cooked in the microwave oven.<br>
 Eggs may explode, so avoid exploding food by cutting into eggs before microwave cooking.<br>
 Egg yolk contains fat so tends to cook more quickly than egg white.<br>
 Even out of the shell, eggs may explode in the microwave, because rapid heating causes a build-up of steam.<br>
 Before cooking puncture egg yolks and whites.<br>
 6. Experiment<br>
 Observe the effect of the wavelength of microwaves.<br>
Take out the turntable and put on it a one cup glass measure with water and a long stick of uncooked spaghetti.<br>
 Heat at high for one minute.<br>
 The spaghetti will have an uncooked area every 12 cm.<br>

 A variable autotransformer (autostep down transformer), e.g. Variac, is used to vary the output voltage for a steady AC input voltage.<br>
 Variable autotransformers, often called "Variacs" provide a voltage-adjustable source of alternating current (AC) electricity.<br>
 Unlike a transformer with isolated input and output windings, variacs have a single winding that serves as both the input and output source.<br>
 Variacs do not provide isolation from the line voltage, unlike a true transformer, so they are not suitable for use with low voltage devices.<br>
 They are used for equipment testing and repair, not as a permanent source of power.<br>

 13, 500 lines per inch.<br>
 When light rays enter the spectroscope, they are separated, according to different wavelengths, into a spectrum or spectra and produce an interference
 pattern are sharpened to appear as bright lines of reinforcement (maxima).<br>
 Each element has its own characteristic bright lines on its spectrum so the spectroscope is used for chemical analysis.<br>
 Spectroscopes are also used in astronomy to determine the elements in the sun and stars, because it can produce separated line images for light sources
 with similar wavelengths.<br>
 The spectroscope invented by Joseph von Fraunhofer in 1820 used fine parallel wires.<br>
 Experiments<br>
 1. Make a diffraction grating by drawing evenly-spaced clear black lines on a white card.<br>
 Then take a high quality black and white photograph using a camera stand.<br>
 Use the negative for a diffraction grating.<br>
 However, you can also purchase cheap diffraction gratings as novelty spectacles, called "rainbow glasses".<br>

 In the opposite side of the box, cut a 0.5 cm X 2.5 cm slit opposite the diffraction grating, with the longer side horizontal.<br>
 Attach two razor blades to the outside of the slit, almost edge to edge, to form a very narrow vertical slit.<br>
 Place a 12 V vertical filament lamp, e.g. a neon lamp or argon lamp, in front of the slit.<br>
 Adjust the distance between the two razor blades so that you may see clear linear spectrums when you look through the round hole.<br>
 Use the diffraction grating and a sharp source of light to see the order of colours in the spectrum.<br>

 By using a sensitive instrument called a spectroscope, scientists are often able to analyse the composition of materials located a great distance away.<br>
 The spectroscope has been used to determine the composition of the Sun and other stars and of the atmosphere of many of the planets.<br>
 Spacemen in the future will use this kind of device to analyse the chemical composition of their immediate surroundings.<br>
 Light entering a spectroscope is split up by a diffraction grating to form coloured bands, a spectrum.<br>
 Since each chemical element shows certain characteristic bright shoe box spectroscope lines in its spectrum the material can thus be easily identified.<br>
Experiments<br>
 The materials required are a shoe box, replica grating, see science supply catalogues, some masking tape, and a double edged razor blade broken in two.<br>
 Cut a hole of about 2 cm diameter in the middle of one end of the box.<br>
 Use tape to fix a piece of replica grating over the hole from the inside.<br>

 Atomic absorption spectroscopy, AAS, is used to determine the composition of inorganic elements in a sample.<br>
 AAS works on the principles of atomizing a sample and quantitatively determining the concentration of atoms in the gas phase by measuring the 
 intensity of light absorbed by them when they are irradiated with electromagnetic radiation.<br>
 A key aspect of AAS is the method used to atomize the sample, which also affects the sensitivity of the technique.<br>
 Methods include flame, graphite furnace, electro-thermal, plasma furnace, and vapour-hydride atomization.<br>
 Chemicals prepared for AAS work are called AAS solutions.<br>
 Spectroscopy does destroy samples, but the interfering parts must be removed.<br>
 In AAS analysis for trace metals in blood, biopsy or plant material, the sample tissue must first be digested, usually with perchloric acid or nitric acid.<br>

 When you see a rainbow the sun is behind you and the common centre is in the direction to the sun.<br>
 Rain is falling in the direction of the rainbow.<br>
 When you see a rainbow, note the time and angle of elevation of the sun.<br>
 The rainbow is part of a circle with its centre below the horizon.<br>
 When the sun is higher than 42o the rainbow is completely below the horizon.<br>
 So a rainbow can be seen in the morning or afternoon. but not at midday.<br>
 Rainbows are usually seen about individual cumulus or cumulonimbus clouds that have gaps between them to allow sunlight to fall onto raindrops.<br>
 The sunlight enters the raindrops and reflect off the inside of the far
 surfaces to return towards the sun.<br>
 Different wavelengths reflect at different angles to split the spectrum.<br>
 The light from a rainbow comes towards the observer in the same way that sunlight reflections on the sea surface come towards the observer.<br>
 The sky within the rainbow appears brighter than outside it.<br>
 A secondary dimmer rainbow with reverse order of colours may appear within the primary rainbow.<br>
 A dark region between the primary and secondary rainbows is called Alexander's dark band.<br>

 including radio waves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and γ-radiation.<br>
 The original "microwaves" were 1 mm to 15 cm wave length as required by developments in radar during the Second World War.<br>
 In a narrow sense, light is only electromagnetic radiation in the visible  range, having a wavelength from 400 manometers in the extreme violet
 to about 770 manometers in the extreme red.<br> 
 Light is considered to show both particle and wave properties.<br>
 The fundamental particle or quantum of light is called the photon.<br>
 The velocity of light in a vacuum is c = 2.997 924 58 × 108 m / s, or expressed in three significant figures, c = 3.00 × 108 m / sec.<br>
 In transparent materials the speed of light is less than it is in a vacuum, e.g. 225 000 km / s in water, 200 000 km / s in glass, 29 9711 km / s in air.<br>
 A medium in which the light velocity is low is called an optically dense medium.<br>
  Light can be produced by a physical change, e.g. heating of an object or a chemical change, e.g. burning of magnesium.<br>

 lambda wave length in metres.<br>
 A gamma rays, B X-rays, C1 ultraviolet rays, C visible light, C2 infrared, D microwaves, E radar,<br>
 F TV, H radio short waves, I radio waves<br>
 All electromagnetic radiation travels at the speed of light, c = 3 X 108 m s-1.<br>
 The visible light spectrum has wavelengths 0.7 X 10-6 metres, red, to 0.4 X 10-6 metres, violet.<br>
  Visible spectrum with approximate ranges of wavelengths in nanometres, nm (1 nanometre = 10-9 m):<br>
 violet 390 to 425 nm, indigo 425 to 445 nm, blue 445 to 500 nm, green 500 to 575 nm, yellow 575 to 590 nm, orange 590 to 620 nm, red 620 to 780 nm.<br>
 The velocity of light in a vacuum, c = 3.00 X 108 m / second, but less in transparent materials:<br>
 air 2.99 X 108 m / second, water 2.25 X 108 m / second, glass 2.00 X 108 m / second.<br>
 The microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum is from wavelengths 1 m to 1 mm.<br>
 In Australia, microwave ovens operate at 12 cm wavelength, 2.45 gigahertz, (GHz).<br>
