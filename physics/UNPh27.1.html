 <a href="../images/27.67.jpg">See diagram 27.67</a>: Light diffracting around a hair.<br>
 Babinet's Principle states that the diffraction pattern for an aperture  is the same as the diffraction pattern for an opaque object of the  same shape if illuminated
 in the same manner.<br>
 So the diffraction pattern from an opaque body is identical to diffraction  pattern from a hole of the same size and shape except for  forward beam intensity.<br>
 Except for the intensity of the central spot, the pattern produced by  a diffracting opening of any shape is the same as the pattern  produced by its conjugate.<br>
 A circular hole and a same-sided droplet will produce the same diffraction  pattern.<br>
 Observing the diffraction from shining a laser through a smear of blood  cells can be used to determine the size of the cells.<br>
 Babinet's Principle can be used to measure particles in the corona around  the sun or moon and smog particles, and diffraction from a  hair in a light beam.<br>
 Babinet's principle is used to find equivalence in size and shape, e.g.  size of red blood cells by comparing diffraction pattern with an  array of small holes.<br>
 Babinet's principle is used in slot antennas at frequencies between 300  MHz and 24 GHz.<br>
 Experiments<br>
 1. Put a 0.1 mm wire into a laser beam and note the diffraction pattern.<br>
 Note the diffraction pattern when the laser is shone through a narrow  slit.<br>
 Make the slit with 1. a laser printer, 2. a photocopier then print on  clear plastic film, 3. a pin to draw a line on a piece of smoked glass  from a candle flame.<br>
 2. Draw black spots on white paper, reduced them photographically, and  use the positive and negative copies as complementary arrays.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="27.1.2H">27.1.2</a> Diffraction in a ripple  tank<br> 
 Diffraction occurs when a straight wave passes through a narrow gap.<br>
 The waves spread at the edge of obstacles, e.g. edges of a gap, and curve  in behind an isolated obstacle.<br>
 1. Note diffraction when a wave hits two barriers  separated by a gap of about 1 cm or less.<br>
 Place the barriers 5 cm from the source of vibration, the vibrating beam.<br>
 Block off the outer end of the barriers with side barriers.<br>
 Increase the width of the gap to about 10 cm and note less diffraction.<br>
 Put weights on the barriers if they start to vibrate.<br>
 2. Repeat the experiment with two equally separated  gaps.<br>
 Increase the width of the gap and note less diffraction.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="27.1.3H">27.1.3</a> Diffraction of light, diffraction grating, spectroscope<br>.
 Diffraction is the curving of light around the edges of objects and the consequent spreading of light when it passes through narrow gaps.<br>
 Single slit diffraction pattern is different from double slit interference.<br>
 Look at a vertical filament lamp through the slit formed by holding two fingers together.<br>
 A diffraction grating is a piece of plastic or glass with many opaque parallel lines rules on it, e.g. 100 lines per mm, 300 lines per mm, 1000 per mm, 
 13 500 lines per inch.<br>
 A diffraction grating with 15000 lines to the inch, mounted vertically in the beam produces a brilliant spectrum.<br>
 When light rays enter the spectroscope, they are separated, according to different wavelengths, into a spectrum or spectra and produce an interference
 pattern are sharpened to appear as bright lines of reinforcement (maxima).<br>
 Each element has its own characteristic bright lines on its spectrum so the spectroscope is used for chemical analysis.<br>
 Spectroscopes are also used in astronomy to determine the elements in the sun and stars, because it can produce separated line images for light sources
 with similar wavelengths.<br>
 The spectroscope invented by Joseph von Fraunhofer in 1820 used fine parallel wires.<br>

 1. A slide projector is directed towards the front of the lecture theatre.<br>
 A diffraction grating with 15000 lines to the inch is mounted vertically in the beam producing a brilliant spectrum in the region shown.<br>
 2. Make a diffraction grating by drawing evenly-spaced  clear black lines on a white card.<br>
 Then take a high quality black and white photograph using a camera stand.<br>
 Use the negative for a diffraction grating.<br>
 However, you can also purchase cheap diffraction gratings as novelty 
 spectacles, sometimes called "rainbow glasses".<br>
 3. Hold a feather near your eye and observe a burning  candle far from you.<br>
 Adjust the distance of feather from your eye until you see four X-shaped  colour bands.<br>
 You may also see two blue and two red bands in each of the four bands.<br>
 4. Stretch nylon gauze or a woman's fine scarf tightly and observe a burning candle through it.<br>
 See colour stripes appearing in the direction of the fibres.<br>
 Different weaving and different shapes of small holes will affect different shape of the stripes.<br>
 You may see an X-shaped diffraction pattern through some types of nylon  gauze.<br>
 5. Make a spectrum without a prism.<br>
 Set a tray of water in bright sunlight.<br>
 Lean a rectangular pocket mirror against an inside edge with the lower  part immersed in the water.<br>
 Adjust the mirror so that a spectrum appears on the wall.<br>
 6. Pass light through a spherical flask of water and view the rainbow on a screen placed between the light and the flask.<br>
 7. Cut a 2 cm diameter round hole at one end of  a cardboard shoe box.<br>
  Attach a diffraction grating across the hole on the inside of the box.<br>
 Note the direction of the slit on the grating.<br>
 In the opposite side of the box, cut a 0.5 cm × 4.5 cm slit opposite the diffraction grating, with the longer side horizontal.<br>
 Attach two razor blades to the outside of the slit, almost edge to edge,  to form a very narrow vertical slit.<br>
 Place a 12 V vertical filament lamp, e.g. a neon lamp or argon lamp, in front of the slit.<br>
 Adjust the distance between the two razor blades so that you may see clear linear spectrums when you look through the round hole.<br>
 Use the diffraction grating and a sharp source of light to see the order  of colours in the spectrum.<br>
 ROYGBIV, represents red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.<br>
 Note the bright lines in spectra produced by fluorescent mercury lamps  and neon signs.<br>
 8. Make a drink-can spectroscope.<br>
 Tape a replica grating over the hole cut a slit in the bottom.<br>
 Make a slit in the cover of a film canister and place a grating over a hole in the bottom made with a No. 2 cork bore.<br>
 9. View a motor car headlamp through a small square  of silk to observe two-dimensional grating diffraction interference.<br>
 10. Train yourself to see speckle patterns in unfiltered  sun diffraction interference scattered by a diffusing surface.<br>
 11. Use a diffraction grating in air and water.<br>
 Measure the pattern of a laser beam incident on a diffraction grating placed inside an empty aquarium and with it full of water.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="27.1.4 H">27.1.4</a> Resolution, resolvance of diffraction grating<br>
 Diffraction causes images of closely-spaced objects to merge with the loss of individual detail, called poor resolution.<br>
 Increased magnification only produces a large image lacking in detail.<br>
 A diffraction grating has a high resolving power, so is used in analysis of a spectrum, because it can produce separated line images for light sources
 with similar wavelengths.<br>
 The "resolving power", resolvance, of a device used to separate the wavelengths of light is as follows:<br>
 R = λ /delta λ, where delta λ = smallest resolvable wavelength difference.<br>
 The two sodium "D-lines" are at 589.00 nm and 589.59 nm, so R = 589 / 0.59 = 1000, the standard benchmark for the resolvance of a diffraction grating 
 or spectrometer.<br>
 The resolving power of a microscope or telescope is a measure of its ability to produce separated images.<br>

 Electromagnetic radiation can travel through a vacuum.<br>
 Sunlight is electromagnetic radiation in all ranges.<br>
 Light is electromagnetic radiation in all ranges, having a wavelength from 10-7 to 10-15 metres,
 including radio waves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and γ-radiation.<br>
 The original "microwaves" were 1 mm to 15 cm wave length as required by developments in radar during the Second World War.<br>
 In a narrow sense, light is only electromagnetic radiation in the visible  range, having a wavelength from 400 manometers in the extreme violet
 to about 770 manometers in the extreme red.<br> 
 Light is considered to show both particle and wave properties.<br>
 The fundamental particle or quantum of light is called the photon.<br>
 The velocity of light in a vacuum is c = 2.997 924 58 × 108 m / s, or expressed in three significant figures, c = 3.00 × 108 m / sec.<br>
 In transparent materials the speed of light is less than it is in a vacuum, e.g. 225 000 km / s in water, 200 000 km / s in glass, 29 9711 km / s in air.<br>
 A medium in which the light velocity is low is called an optically dense medium.<br>
  Light can be produced by a physical change, e.g. heating of an object or a chemical change, e.g. burning of magnesium.<br>

 A coherer, Branly coherer (invented by Eduard Branly, 1844-1940, France) is a glass tube containing metal filings which decrease in resistance
 to an electric current and so was used to detect radio waves.<br>
 The metal filings cohere to reduce resistance of the bulk filings.<br>
 By tapping the glass tube, the metal filings can be made to fall apart or "decohere".<br>
 The on-off activity was used to transmit the first morse code signals.<br>
 Experiment<br>
 Make a simple coherer by putting some iron filings into a cleaned-out narrow plastic tube reservoir from ballpoint and inserting screws in each
 end to act as electrodes.<br>
 Complete the circuit with a battery and an LED.<br>
 A signal from a transmitter, e.g. an auto ignition coil or a barbecue piezo ignitor, turns on the LED, and tapping the coherer turns it off.<br>

 <a href="#Table27.28H">See Table 27.28</a>: Types of radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum.<br>
 Gamma rays, γ-rays, have shortest wavelength, highest frequency, most energy of any part of the electromagnetic spectrum.<br>
 They are ionizing radiation and so are hazardous, because they can kill cells and sterilize by killing pathogens.<br>
 They are produced by neutron stars, pulsars, supernova explosions, nuclear explosions on Earth, lightning, and radioactive decay of natural radioisotopes.<br>
 They are not reflected by mirrors, because their wavelengths are so short they pass through the space between most atoms.<br>
 However, when they collide with electrons in certain crystals, they scatter.<br>

 At about 1000oC electric lamp filaments become "white hot" and emit infrared rays an all colours of the spectrum.<br>
 Infrared lamps are used to treat sore muscles and dry paint.<br>

 Microwave kit, (Commercial).<br>
 <a href="#Table27.28H">See Table 27.28</a>: Types of radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum.<br>
 Microwaves are a form of high frequency radio waves as in AM and FM radio, but are much shorter.<br>
 A magnetron tube, the heart of the microwave oven, converts electricity into microwave energy.<br>
 From the magnetron tube, microwave energy is transmitted to the oven cavity through a small plastic-covered piece.<br>
 In the food, the microwaves are converted to heat, losing half their power every 2-3 cm.<br>
 Metals reflect microwave energy, but do not become hot.<br>
 Plastic, paper and glass transmit microwave energy, but do not become hot.<br>
 Food absorbs microwave energy, causing the water molecules in the food to vibrate.<br>
 Friction from the vibration produces heat energy and so causes the food to become hot.<br>

 A radio telescope can detect microwaves from distant stars seen by visible light.<br>
 The microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum is from wavelengths 1 m to 1 mm.<br>
 In Australia, microwave ovens operate at 12 cm wavelength.<br>
 Besides cooking, a microwave oven can be used to sterilize soil in potting mix, extract more juice from squeezed citrus fruit,
 liquidized hard honey, warm damp plates and dry herbs and flowers.<br>
 Small insects can survive in a microwave oven, but larger creatures, e.g. mice, cats, humans, can be killed by microwave oven radiation.<br>
 The cause of death is the heating of the brainstem, which controls breathing, swallowing, and other autonomic physical reactions.<br>

 UV-B rays cause sunburn and increase the risk of damage to DNA.<br>
 About 95 % of UV-B rays are absorbed by ozone in the Earth's atmosphere, but each year, a "hole" of thinning atmospheric
 ozone expands over Antarctica to exposing people increased levels of harmful UV rays.<br>
Vitamin D is synthesized by people exposed to adequate sunlight.<br>

 Visible light rays, 4 × 10-7 to 7 <tt>×</tt> 10-7 m, can be analysed into a visible light spectrum.<br>
 Visible spectrum with approximate ranges of wavelengths in nanometres, nm (1 nanometre = 10-9 m):<br>
 violet 390 to 425 nm, indigo 425 to 445 nm, blue 445 to 500 nm, green 500 to 575 nm, yellow 575 to 590 nm, orange 590 to 620 nm, red 620 to 780 nm.<br>
 The velocity of light in a vacuum, c = 3.00 × 108 m / second,<br>

 <a href="#Table27.28H">See Table 27.28</a>: Types of radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum.<br>
 X-rays, Roentgen rays (discovered by Wilhelm Röntgen, Germany, 1845 -1923), have very small wavelengths and act more like particles than waves.<br>
 X-rays are able to penetrate soft tissue, but not bone.<br>
 An X-ray image shows the bones as a shadow.<br>
 Bones and teeth, being more dense, absorb more X-rays than skin, so shadows of bones can be projected onto film.<br>
 They are used for customs and security detection, and testing pearls, gemstones, old paintings, welding joints.<br>
 They kill cancer cells, but healthy tissue must be shielded from them.<br>
 X-rays are a form of electromagnetic energy with high energy, but very short wavelength, which can pass through many substances normally opaque to visible light.<br>
 The higher the frequency, i.e. the shorter the wavelength, the greater the penetrating power.<br>
 The lower the atomic weight of a substance the more easily X-rays can pass through it.<br>
 When X-rays pass through a human body, the fleshy parts produce a faint shadow on a photographic plate, the bones produce a darker shadow and any
 metal, e.g. a wedding ring, produces a very dark shadow.<br>
 When discovered in Germany in 1895, their origin was unknown so were called X, but also called roentgen rays.<br>
 Experiments<br>
 Examine X-ray photographs<br>
 1. Examine animal and human X-ray photographs over a light table.<br>
 If human X-ray photographs are cut into pieces, the students can practice reassembling them.<br>
 2. Compare inner and outer structures of animals, e.g. seashells, by comparing photographs with X-ray photographs.<br>

 Coherent light is light that is "in phase".<br>
 A laser (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) is a powerful source of coherent light.<br>
 <a href="../images/27.57.gif">See diagram 27.57</a>: Young's two-slit experiment.<br>
 Two point sources of coherent light can be produced by directing any light through a single narrow slit then through a double slit arrangement.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="27.4.3H">27.4.3</a> Scattering, Rayleigh scattering, Mie scattering<br>
 Rayleigh scattering is scattering of light and other electromagnetic radiation by polarized particles smaller than the wavelength of light, e.g. gas molecules.<br>
 It is the main cause of the blue (blue-green hue) colour of the sky and the yellow colour of the sun where the shorter wavelengths of the spectrum, i.e. violet and blue, 
 scatter more than the longer wavelengths.<br>
 So the hue of the sun from within the atmosphere is a red yellow, but redder near the horizon, caused by the remaining longer wavelengths, while the shorter
 wavelengths are scattered away.<br>
 Gas particles about the size of the wavelength of light cause Mie scattering to cause the white to grey colour of clouds.<br>
 Rayleigh scattering allows a laser beam to be seen at night.<br>
 Both Rayleigh scattering and Mie scattering are used to analyse solutions, gases and even biological tissue.<br>
 Experiments<br>
 1. Red and blue beam<br>
 Pass a red beam is passed through a solution of gum mastic, but a blue beam does not pass through it.<br>
 2. Colour of smoke<br>
 Cigarette smoke is blue, but after exhaling is white.<br>
 3. Note multiple scattering in darkening of wet sand and whiteness of milk.<br>
 4. Dust halos<br>
 A glass plate covered with dust is held in a beam that converges into a hole in a screen.<br>
 Circular halos appear on the screen around the hole.<br>

 <a href="../images/27.57.gif">See diagram 27.57</a>: Young's two-slit experiment.<br>
 Young's two-slit experiment<br>
 Two point sources of "in phase" light produce an interference pattern  of nodes and antinodes just like two point dippers dipping in  phase into water
 of uniform depth in a ripple tank.<br>
 The shorter the wavelength, the more closely crammed is the interference  pattern so the pattern for violet light is more crammed than  the pattern for red light.<br>
 1. For any point in the pattern observed, sin θ = (path difference / d) = (x / L).<br>
 2. For any nodal point in the pattern observed, sin θ = (n - 1/2) λ / d = (x / L).<br>
 3. The bright bars in the interference pattern observed, and the nodes, are uniformly spaced, x.<br>
 x = Lλ / d.<br>
 4. The shorter the wavelength, the more closely crammed is the interference  pattern.<br>
 So the pattern for violet light, λ = 4.5 X 10-5 m is more crammed than the pattern for red light, λ = 6 X 10-7 m.<br>

 Dichroic lamps, jewellery, crystals, quinine iodosulfate, tourmaline<br>
 Tourmaline, NaFe<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>6</sub>[(OH)<sub>4</sub>(BO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3, </sub>Si<sub>6, </sub>O<sub>18</sub>], (in Pegmatites), 
 double refraction, contains about 10 % boron.<br>
 Dichroism (Greek <i>dikhros</i> two colours) refers to substances that absorb light depending its direction or how much the substances are polarized.<br>
 So dichroic substances have a different colour when seen from different directions.<br>
 So dichroic jewellery has a reflected colour and a different transmitted colour.<br>
 As you look at it, the colours seem to change all the time.<br>
 Down lights, are usually halogen mirror reflector lamps, e.g. 12V 50W, MR16 dichroic lamp, but these lamps are being ordered, replaced by the 
 Australian government, because of high energy usage.<br>
 Dichroic lamps have a coating on the reflectors of "multi-layer interference films" that selectively reflect or transmit certain wavelengths of visible light, IR, 
 and UV to reduce the heat in the beam.<br>
 Dichroic crystals present different colours by transmitted light, when viewed in two different directions, the colours being unlike in the direction of unlike or 
 unequal axes.<br>
 They absorbs the component of wave polarized in a particular direction.<br>

 In 1846, Wilhelm von Haidinger, Austria, perceived a faint yellowish stain or "brush" that remained when he looked directly at light.<br>
 The "brush" rotated together with the rotation of a polarizer, so he was observing polarization.<br>
 Train yourself to detect polarized light with the naked eye.<br>
 Look through a sheet polarizer at a piece of white paper illuminated by the sun or at a white cloud for, 20 seconds, rotate 
 the polarizer 90o, look again for 20 seconds, continue rotating back and forth every 5 seconds.<br>

 Use a slide projector is used to illuminate the solution.<br>
 The solution appears bluish white in scattered light and yellowish in direct light indicating that Rayleigh scattering predominates.<br>

 <a href="../images/27.56.gif">See diagram 27.56</a>: Variac circuit.<br>
 A variable autotransformer (autostep down transformer), e.g. Variac,  is used to vary the output voltage for a steady AC input voltage.<br>
 Variable autotransformers, often called "Variacs" provide a voltage-adjustable source of alternating current (AC) electricity.<br>
 Unlike a transformer with isolated input and output windings, variacs have a single winding that serves as both the input and output source.<br>
 Variacs do not provide isolation from the line voltage, unlike a true transformer, so they are not suitable for use with low voltage devices.<br>
 They are used for equipment testing and repair, not as a permanent source  of power.<br>
 Experiment<br>
 Vary the voltage to a 1 KW light bulb with a variable autotransformer  to show colour change with temperature.<br>
 Vary the voltage across a clear glass lamp from zero to 50% over voltage.<br>
 Also measure the intensity and plot against power.<br>

 <a href="../images/28.220.gif">See diagram 28.220</a>: Colour of sunlight.<br>
 The rainbow consists of nearly circular arcs of colour with a common centre.<br>
 When you see a rainbow the sun is behind you and the common centre is  in the direction to the sun.<br>
 Rain is falling in the direction of the rainbow.<br>
 When you see a rainbow, note the time and angle of elevation of the sun.<br>
 The rainbow is part of a circle with its centre below the horizon.<br>
 When the sun is higher than 42 degrees the rainbow is completely below the horizon.<br>
 So a rainbow can be seen in the morning or afternoon, but not at midday.<br>
 Rainbows are usually seen about individual cumulus or cumulonimbus clouds  that have gaps between them to allow sunlight to fall onto  raindrops.<br>
 The sunlight enters the raindrops and reflect off the inside of the far  surfaces to return towards the sun.<br>
 Different wavelengths reflect at different angles to split the spectrum.<br>
 The light from a rainbow comes towards the observer in the same way that  sunlight reflections on the sea surface come towards the  observer.<br>
 The sky within the rainbow appears brighter than outside it.<br>
 A secondary dimmer rainbow with reverse order of colours may appear within  the primary rainbow.<br>
 A dark region between the primary and secondary rainbows is called Alexander's  dark band.<br>
 Rainbows are seen in fogs, fog bows, when sunlight from behind the observer  passes through a break in the fog.<br>
 Also a rainbow may be seen from an aircraft window when looking down on the shadow of the aircraft on cloud below.<br>
 A corona may be observed around the moon consisting of a central white  disc wider than the moon with a faint spectrum ring of colour  around it.<br>
 Experiments<br>
 1. Use a shallow dish of water to form a spectrum on the wall or on a  screen.<br>
 The light from the sun has to first pass through the water then be reflected  back on the wall by the mirror.<br>
 This experiment needs very fine adjustment to the angle of the mirror.<br>
 Also, the spectrum forms only when the water is still so careful adjustment  and patience is needed!<br>
 2. Make a spectrum with a fine spray garden hose.<br>
 Most children will have seen the rainbow produced from the fine spray  of the garden hose in the sunlight.<br>
 3. Time of appearance of a rainbow<br>
 4. Artificial rainbow<br>
 Form a vertical circle rainbow by placing a tube of water between a prism  and screen.<br>
 Use a single sphere with the back surface coated with a reflecting material  to show both primary and secondary bows with increased  intensity.<br>
 5. Rainbow droplets<br>
 Small droplets formed by spraying an atomizer on a soot covered glass  plate glisten like coloured jewels when viewed at degrees.<br>
 Use small glass spheres to generate bows and halos.<br>
 6. Arc lamp<br>
 An arc lamp directed at a sphere of water forms a rainbow on a screen  rainbow.<br>
 Visible spectrum, rainbow<br>

 Sunlight through prism, recombining spectrum, rainbow, spectroscope, electromagnetic spectrum<br>
 The spectrum is the arrangement of frequencies or wavelengths when electromagnetic radiation are separated into their constituent parts.<br>
 Visible light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum and most sources emit waves over a range of wavelengths that can be broken up or "dispersed".<br>
 White light can be separated into the seven colours of the spectrum: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet, also called the fundamental colours.<br>
 Light scattered from small molecules is polarized at right angles to the direction of propagation of the original beam.<br>
