<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="29.2.1H">29.2.1</a> Force between current-carrying wires<br>
 A current-carrying wire exerts a force on another current-carrying wire.<br>
 If two wires parallel to each other, carrying a current I<sub>1</sub> and I<sub>2</sub>, and distance s apart, are lying on the desk before you,
 the magnetic field from the first wire circulates vertically around the first wire from above to below it and vertically cuts across the second wire.<br>
 So the second wire experiences a magnetic field down across it.<br>
 So wires carrying a current is the same direction attract each other and wires carrying a current in opposite directions repel each other.<br>
 So we can calculate, in a vacuum, the force per metre (F/L), between two parallel conductors one metre apart (s) carrying a one amp current.<br>
 F/L = (mu<sub>o</sub>/ 2 pi)( I<sub>1</sub> X I<sub>2</sub> / s)<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="29.2.2H">29.2.2</a> Magnetic force exerted on a current-carrying wire<br>
 The movement of electric charges along a wire causes electric current.<br>
 So a current-carrying wire will experience magnetic forces in the same way as the moving charges in the wire.<br>
 The magnetic force on a current-carrying wire is at right angles to both the direction of the wire and the direction of the magnetic field.<br>
 The direction of the force is given by the open right-hand rule.<br>
 From magnetic force on moving charge, previous paragraph, F = q vB sin θ.<br>
 In the equation, divide q by t = q/t, and multiply v by t = (vt).<br>
 Now F = q/t(vt)B sin θ - the equation has not changed!<br>
 But q/t is charge passing in unit time = current, I.<br>
 Also (vt) = distance or length of wire travelled by the charge = length L.<br>
 So F = ILB sin θ newton, N.<br>
 Magnetic force, F = ILB sin θ newton, N, where I = current, L = length of the conductor, e.g. wire, B = magnetic field, θ = angle between the
 direction of the conductor and the direction of the magnetic field.<br>
 Maximum force is when direction of current is at right angles to direction of magnetic field (θ = 90<sup>o</sup>, sin θ = 1).<br>
 So F = ILB.<br>
 Minimum force, is when direction of current is in same direction as magnetic field (θ = 0<sup>o</sup>, sin θ = 0).<br>
 So F = 0 (no force).<br>

 Ampère's law, permeability of free space, µ<sub>0</sub> = 4π × 10<sup>-7</sup>henry/metre<br>
 The magnetic field in space around an electric current is proportional to the electric current that serves as its source.<br>
 Ampère's law relates the magnetic field along a closed path to the electric current enclosed by the path.<br>
 Assume a circular path exists around a long straight wire carrying an electric current.<br>
 The magnetic field is always parallel to this closed path and always has magnitude B at all points on the closed path.<br>
 In a closed loop path, the sum of the length elements × magnetic field in the direction of the length element = magnetic constant X current enclosed in the loop.<br>

 The Biot-Savart law expresses the intensity of magnetic flux density produced at a point at a distance from a current-carrying conductor.<br>
 It gives Ampère's law, Ampère-Laplace law, that expresses the force between parallel current-carrying conductors in free space.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="29.3.3H">29.3.3</a> Lorentz force law<br>
 Lorentz force (Hendrik Antoon Lorentz, 1853-1928), is the force on a point charge due to electromagnetic field.<br>
 It is the force exerted on a charged particle by a magnetic field through which it is moving.<br>
 If a charged particle is moving in the presence of an electric field and a magnetic field, F = (qE) + (qv × B), 
 where F = force, E = electric field, q = charge, v = velocity, B = magnetic field<br>
 The first term, qE, is contributed by the electric field.<br>
 The second term, qv × B, is the magnetic force and has a direction perpendicular to both the velocity and the magnetic field.<br>
 The magnetic force is proportional to q and to the magnitude of the vector cross product v × B.<br>
 If the angle between v and B =<nobr>α</nobr>, the force = qvB sin <nobr>α</nobr>.<br>
 For a charged particle moving in a uniform magnetic field,<br>
 If angle <nobr>α</nobr> = 90 (v is perpendicular to B<nobr></nobr>), the particle will follow a circular trajectory, radius, r = mv / qB.<br>
 If angle<nobr> α</nobr> &lt; 90, the particle orbit will be a helix with an axis parallel to the field lines.<br>
 If angle <nobr>α</nobr> = 0, there will be no magnetic force on the particle, so it continue to move undeflected along the field lines.<br>
 Charged particle accelerators like cyclotrons make use of the fact that particles move in a circular orbit when v and B are at right angles.<br>

 Experiment<br>
 Place a glass plate over a bar magnet and sprinkle iron filings over the glass.<br>
 Tap the glass plate a few times to overcome friction and the iron filings arrange themselves in a pattern of arcs from one pole of the magnet to the other.<br>
 This pattern is a map of the unseen magnetic force that permeates space.<br>
 Magnetic fields show the effect a magnet would have in that region.<br>
 Magnetic fields are usually represented by drawing magnetic field lines in the same way that electric field may be shown.<br>
 The closer the magnetic field lines the stronger the magnetic field.<br>
 Magnetic field lines point away from the north poles towards the south poles in closed loops that never cross over.<br>

 A solenoid is a long wire wound into successive helical loops to produce a strong magnetic field inside the solenoid parallel to its axis.<br>
 Each loop carries current in the same direction and the wire successive loops are almost parallel so the magnetic force between loops is attractive.<br>
 The magnetic field outside the solenoid is weak and may be assumed to be zero.<br>
 So the magnetic field lines, lines of force are close together inside the solenoid and far apart outside the solenoid.<br>

 The force, F<sup>--&gt;</sup> on this charged particle = qvBsin θ (theta).<br>
 The force, F<sup>--&gt;</sup> is maximum when velocity V--&gt; is at right angles to B--&gt; because θ (theta) = 90<sup>o</sup>, so sin θ (theta) = 1.<br>
 The force, F<sup>--&gt;</sup> is minimum (0), when velocity V--&gt; is in same direction as B--&gt;, because θ (theta) = 0<sup>o</sup>,
 so sin θ (theta) = 0.<br>
 The charged particle experiences no force so moves with constant velocity.<br>
 The force, F<sup>--&gt;</sup> is between minimum (0), and maximum when velocity V--&gt; is at angle θ theta with B--&gt;, so sin θ (theta) = between 0

 A magnetic field, B, exists where a charge experiences a force, because of its motion.<br>
 Detect a magnetic field by using a compass needle that aligns itself in the direction of the magnetic field at that place.<br>
 A magnetic field refers to where a magnetic force is found, i.e. magnetic flux is present.<br>
 The force found in a magnetic field has a direction at any point in the magnetic field found by putting small pieces of iron in the magnetic field.<br>
 The direction is called a line of force.<br>
 In a strong magnetic field, many lines of force are found in a very small space, the flux density is high.<br>
 Magnetic field lines, lines of force, can be drawn to show the direction a compass needle would have at any place in the magnetic field.<br>
 Magnetic field lines never cross, because at any point the compass needle can point only in one direction in space.<br>
 Assume that the direction of the magnetic field is the direction of a compassneedle, so magnetic field lines leave north poles and enter south poles.<br>
 Like magnetic poles repel, i.e. NN or SS.<br>
 Unlike poles attract, i.e. NS or SN.<br>

 Lines of magnetic force are unbroken, pass through the magnet, never cross and have the same strength.<br>
 A strong magnetic field has more lines of force in an area than a weak field.<br>
 If you bring the north pole of one magnet close to the south pole of another magnet, the two magnets will attract each other.<br>
 If you bring the north pole of one magnet near to the north pole of another magnet, these poles will repel each other.<br>
 The lines of force repel each other, and the two magnets push each other away.<br>
 If you turn around the magnets so that the two south poles brought together, the poles will repel each other.<br>

 2. Refrigerator door magnet<br>
 <a href="../images/29.177.gif">See diagram 29.177</a>: Refrigerator door magnet, "fridge magnet".<br>
 In a refrigerator door magnet, the magnetic field lines are more intense on one side than the other, because they contain side-by-side, parallel horseshoe
 magnets.<br>
 Refrigerator door magnets are made of soft white plastic.<br>
 One side has a message, e.g. Jo's Pizza Parlour Telephone, and only the other side is magnetic and can stick to the refrigerator door.<br>
 The magnetic side of the plastic contains magnetic ferrite stripes of opposite polarity that together act like a row of side by side horseshoe magnets.<br>
 This arrangement, called a Halbach array (Klaus Halbach, 1924-2000, USA), causes a stronger magnetic field on one side and almost no magnetic field
 on the other side.<br>
 Magnetic flux cancels below the plane and reinforces above the plane.<br>
 A magnetization pattern where the two components are <nobr>π</nobr> / 2 out of phase causes a one-sided flux.<br>
 So the side with the message cannot stick to the refrigerator door.<br>

3. Magnetic levitation, maglev, is where an object is suspended only by magnetic fields.<br>
 In a maglev train, linear motors use a force from a moving linear magnetic field that react with a conducting rail.<br>
 Electromagnets in the train lift it and act as the rotor of an electric motor.<br>
 Eddy currents induced in the rail create an opposing magnetic field.<br>
 The two opposing magnetic fields repel each other and force the conductor away from the stator in the direction of the moving magnetic field.<br>
 This principle is used in the Shanghai Maglev Train and other magnetic levitation trains.<br>
 A Halbach array is used to suspend in the air a speeding Inductrack Maglev train, e.g. in Shanghai.<br>
 In a speeding train, the Halbach arrays repels loops of wire forming the track to lift the train.<br>

 1. A positive charge crossing a magnetic field line experiences a force in the direction found by using the open right-hand rule:<br>
 Fingers point in the direction of the magnetic field (north to south).<br>
 Thumb points in the direction of movement of the positive charge.<br>
 Palm of the hand pushes in direction of force on the positive charge.<br>
 2. The size of the force on the positive charge depends on the product of four factors:<br>
 * the size of the charge, q,<br>
 * the velocity of the charge, v, in m / s,<br>
 * the strength of the magnetic field, B,<br>
 * the angle between the direction of movement of the positive charge and the direction of the field lines, θ<br>
 So F = q v B sin.<br>
 3. The right-hand rule shows the direction of a magnetic force by the Lorentz force law.<br>
 It shows the force on a moving positive charge and is in opposite direction for a negative charge moving in the same direction.<br>

 * The thumb is pointed in the direction of movement of the rod, because positive charges will be moved in that direction, so this is the initial direction of movement of conventional current.<br>
 * The fingers point in the direction of the magnetic field B.<br>
 * The push of the palm indicates which end of the rod will become positive.<br>
 Electrons will move to the other end and make it negative.<br>

 Oersted effect, magnetic field around a current-carrying wire<br>
 Oersted's Apparatus</a> (Commercial).<br>
 <a href="../images/29.2.1.2m.gif">See diagram 29.2.1.1</a>: Oersted effect.<br>
 <a href="../images/30.01.gif">See diagram 30.01</a>: Right-hand grip rule.<br>
 H. C. Oersted used to demonstrate no connection between electricity and magnetism when he would place a compass needle at right
 angles to a current-carrying wire to show that there was no effect on each the other.<br>
 But a student asked, "What would happen if the compass needle was placed parallel to the current carrying wire?"<br>
 In 1820, Hans Christian Oersted, Danish physicist, noticed that the needle of a compass near a wire carrying a current turned so that
 the needle at right angles to the wire.<br>
 Perhaps he had heard that when lightning strikes the masts of tall sailing ships, the ships compass spins wildly.<br>
 Realising that moving electricity created a magnetic force, he invented the term "electromagnetism".<br>
 Experiment<br>
 1. Show Oersted's effect with a compass needle and a long wire carrying a heavy current to explore the magnetic field around a long wire.<br>
 A compass deflects above and below a current-carrying wire.<br>
 Hold a current-carrying wire over a bar magnet on a pivot and the magnet moves perpendicular to the wire.<br>
 Arrange four compass needles around a vertical wire running through Plexiglas.<br>
 Pass a current of 50 amps through a heavy vertical wire and investigate the magnetic field with a compass needle.<br>
 Pass a heavy current from a storage cell through a long wire and use a compass needle to investigate the near by magnetic field.<br>
 When demonstrating Oersted's effect using large currents, use flat-braided brass cable instead of copper wire.<br>
 2. An electric current flowing through a wire produces a magnetic field.<br>
 The field is cylindrical around the wire and obeys the right-hand grip rule:<br>
 Grip the wire with the right-hand and point the thumb in the direction of the conventional current (+ ve to -ve), I, the fingers curl around the
 wire in the direction of the magnetic field, B.<br>
 The magnetic field of a solenoid is a uniform magnetic field that follows a right-hand rule.<br>
 The strength of the magnetic field of a solenoid, B = 4 πknI, n = numbers of wrapped wire circles (turns), I = electric current, k = the constant
 of magnetic effect.<br>
 3. If a magnetic field is at an angle A to the conductor carrying a current, then the magnetic force on the conductor will be force × sin A.<br>
 The force will be a maximum when A = 90<sup>o</sup>, and will be zero when A = 0<sup>o</sup>.<br>
 Use the open right-hand rule to find the direction of the force.<br>
 If the angle A = 0<sup>o</sup>, then the current-carrying conductor is now parallel to the magnetic field, and no magnetic force is produced on
 the conductor.<br>
 4. Direction of a magnetic field caused by a current-carrying wire<br>
 Use the right-hand rule: (Right-hand grip rule, right-hand curl rule, magnetic field right-hand rule).<br>
 Point the thumb along the wire in the direction of the current, I.<br>
 The fingers curl around the wire in the direction of the magnetic field.<br>
 Place plotting compasses around a vertical long straight wire carrying a current, point along tangents to a circle with the wire as the centre of the circle.<br>
 5. When a current flows through a straight wire, a magnetic field occurs in concentric circles around the wire.<br>
 The right-hand grip rule states that if you grip a wire carrying a current in the right-hand, with the thumb extended in the direction of the conventional current, 
 positive to negative, the fingers will be curled around the wire in the direction of the magnetic field.<br>
 In the centre of a current loop the magnetic field points in one direction.<br>

 Design a experiment to verify the hypothesis.<br>
 Set up the magnet and paper clip tied to the thread and stone in a proper place on the table.<br>
 The clip attracted by the magnet maintains a distance from the magnet due to tying to the thread so there is a magnetic field between the magnet and clip.<br>

Electromagnetic field, EM Field
 A "field" is a property or a condition of space.<br>

 His experiment with iron filings that align themselves in the region around a magnet forming "lines of force" about a magnet led.<br>
 Faraday to believe that there must be a field present in the space around the magnet.<br>
 However, the idea that fields can exist by themselves as properties of space was not accepted by physicists,.<br>
 who invented an invisible substance called "ether" to carry the EM oscillations.<br>
 Although belief in the ether prevailed for decades, but when no evidence for its existence could be found, despite many attempts,.<br>
 the ether was finally abandoned and physicists accepted that the EM field has an existence in itself.<br>
