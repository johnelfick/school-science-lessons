<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.1.5H">16.1.5</a> Spirit level accelerometer<br>
 A glass tube with a special shape is nearly filled with methylated spirit, or similar liquid, to leave a visible bubble of air and spirit vapour.<br>
 The bubble always rises to the highest level in the glass tube.<br>
 The spirit level is used to test whether the surface to which it is applied is horizontal.<br>
 It is found in many kinds of surveying instruments, e.g. theodolite and dumpy level, and instruments to assist carpenters, brick layers and builders.<br>
 Alcohols are used, because of their low viscosity and surface tension, so the bubble can move without being retarded much by the glass surface.<br>
 At low temperatures, water in a spirit level could break the glass by ice expansion.<br>
 The spirit usually contains a colorant to increase visibility.<br>
 The bubble of a spirit level, moves in the direction of acceleration, so you can use it as an accelerometer.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.1.6H">16.1.6</a> Rotational inertia<br>
 Projectiles, bullets, rockets and footballs, (Rugby football or American football) are "spin stabilized".<br>
 They make them to spin about the axis of their direction of motion then do not tumble end over end and be retarded by extra air  resistance.<br>
 A children's top falls over when place on its tip, but a rotating top remains upright until it loses all its angular momentum to friction between the tip and the ground and some air resistance.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.2.1H">16.2.1</a> Force, fundamental forces<br>
 The four fundamental forces are gravity, electromagnetism, strong and weak nuclear forces.<br>
 However, most interactions and phenomena can be explained by considering gravity and electromagnetism.<br>
 The forces that act on objects influence their motion, shape, internal energy and state of equilibrium.<br>
 When forces act they may be balanced or unbalanced.<br>
 Unbalanced forces change the motion of objects.<br>
 Gravity is an attractive force that reaches further than the other forces to keep planets in orbit, but it is the weakest in magnitude.<br>
 In the general theory of relativity gravity is defined as the curvature of space time around an object with mass.<br>
 Electromagnetism is the force interaction of particles with an electrical charge.<br>
 Charged particles at rest interact by electrostatic forces, but in motion interact by electrical and magnetic forces.<br>
 The weak nuclear force acts on the atomic nucleus t&gt; control the radioactive decay of atomic nuclei.<br>
 The strong nuclear force keeps protons and neutrons together, even binding two positively charged protons in the helium nucleus.<br>
 This strongest force allows gluons to bind quarks together to form the nucleons.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.2.2H">16.2.2</a> Air track cart<br>
 An air track cart is timed while pulled by a mass on a string over a pulley.<br>
 Accelerate an air track cart up an inclined track by the string pulley and mass system.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.2.3H">16.2.3</a> Atwood's machine<br>
(George Atwood, 1784, England)<br>
<a href="../images/16.4.14.gif">See diagram 16.4.14</a>: Atwood's machine 1.<br>
<a href="../images/16.4.12m.gif">See diagram 16.4.12</a>: Atwood's machine 2.<br>
 Used to verify laws of motion if constant acceleration.<br>
 Two objects mass m1 and m2 connected by an inextensible string over an ideal pulley.<br>
 If m1 = m2, the system is in neutral equilibrium regardless of the position of m1 and m2.<br>
 If m1 is not equal to m2, both masses have uniform acceleration<br>
 weight = m1g or m2g.<br>
 If m1 &gt; m2, m2 has two forces acting it, an upward force T exerted by the string and down force m2g, its weight.<br>
 If T &gt; m2g, upward acceleration a occurs<br>
 (i) T - m2g = m2a<br>
 m1 has an upward pull T on it and downward force m1g on it<br>
 (ii) m1g -T = m1a<br>
 so by combining (i) with (ii), m1g - m2g = m1a + m2a<br>
 a = g (m1 -m2) / (m1 + m2)<br>
 d = gt<sup>2</sup>, so find the time taken by m1 or m2 to travel a distance to calculate a.<br>
 T = 2gm1m2 / (m1 + m2)<br>
Experiment<br>
 1. Hang two equal masses from a light pulley and move one mass to the other side.<br>
 Place 1 kg on each side of a light pulley on good bearings then add 2 g to one side.<br>
 Measure the distance the mass falls and the time taken to fall through this distance.<br>
2. Place 1 kg on each side.<br>
 Add a 2 g mass to the high side.<br>
 Measure the distance the mass falls and the time it takes to fall this distance<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.2.4H">16.2.4</a> Ball in a thrown tube<br>
 Invert and throw a Plexiglas tube full of water that contains a cork.<br>
 The rising cork will remain stationary during the throw.<br>
 Throw or drop a long water-filled tube containing a cork or rubber stopper or air bubble.<br>
 A rising bubble in a jar remains stationary while you throw the jar.<br>
 Join a lead weight and cork with a spring, then put the assembly in a tube of water so the cork just floats and when you drop the tube, the cork sinks.<br>
 Drop a ball in a tube from the ceiling so that the ball strikes the bottom of the tube after the tube hits the floor.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.2.6H">16.2.6</a> Drop different objects<br>
 1. Drop a leaking bucket<br>
 Punch a hole in the bottom of a bucket and fill it with water so that when you drop the bucket no water will run out.<br>
Drop a can with several vertical holes to show no flow in free fall.<br>
Use a pulley system to accelerate the bucket greater than g then the top hole will issue the longest stream of water.<br>
2. Drop a mass on a spring.<br>
 Drop a frame with an oscillating mass on a spring and the mass will be pulled up, but stop oscillating.<br>
3. Drop a slinky spring.<br>
 Hold a slinky spring so some of it extends downward then drop it to show the contraction.<br>
4. Drop a pendulum.<br>
 Suspend a pendulum from a stick.<br>
 Drop the stick when the pendulum is at an extreme and the stick and pendulum will maintain the same relative position.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.2.7H">16.2.7</a> Elevators<br>
 * Quickly raise and lower a spring balance and hanging mass.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.2.8H">16.2.8</a> Equal forces from spring clothes pegs<br>
<a href="../images/16.248.gif">See diagram 16.248</a>: Equal forces from spring clothes pegs.<br>
Tie a spring clothes peg open by tying a thread around the mid point of the long end.<br>
Put the clothes peg on the table and put two identical marbles at the end of the long ends where you would normally put your forefinger and thumb.<br>
Burn or cut the thread.<br>
The clothes peg springs open and exert an equal and opposite force on the marbles, giving them equal speeds in opposite directions.<br>
 Repeat the experiment using a large and a small marble.<br>
 The small marble is given a faster speed than the large marble.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.2.9H">16.2.9</a> Equal forces on light and heavy bodies<br>
<a href="../images/16.247.gif">See diagram 16.247</a>: Equal forces on light and heavy bodies.<br>
When you apply equal forces to light and heavy bodies, the light body moves farther than the heavy body.<br>
 Draw a spot on a rubber band and attach two spring clothes pegs.<br>
 Put a metre stick on the table.<br>
 Pull the clothes pegs apart an equal distance between each clothes peg and the spot.<br>
 Note the position of the spot compared with the metre stick and call this the mid point.<br>
 Release the clothes pegs simultaneously.<br>
 They impact at the mid point.<br>
 The rubber band exerted an equal and opposite force on each clothes peg.<br>
 Attach two clothes pegs on the left side of the rubber band and one on the right side.<br>
 Stretch the rubber band and release the clothes pegs.<br>
 The clothes pegs impact to the left of the mid point.<br>
 Clamp more clothes pegs on the left side and release.<br>
 The clothes pegs on opposite sides of the rubber band impact further to the left of the mid point.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.2.10H">16.2.10</a> Hold a deflating big balloon<br>
 Inflate a big balloon and fasten its mouth.<br>
 Lift it over your head with your hands.<br>
 Make sure the balloon's mouth upright against your head.<br>
 When you untie the string on the balloon's mouth, you may feel the air current spurting out of the balloon.<br>
 Besides your hands feel that the balloon tries to move upward.<br>
 Repeat the experiment, but hold the balloon horizontally and wear a pair of ice skates.<br>
 Observe that the direction of your body's movement is opposite to air current's spurting and the time when your body feels some force.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.2.11H">16.2.11</a> Newton's sailboat, fan on a sailing boat, fan cart<br>
 1. Show that force can be resolved into its individual components.<br>
 Newton's cart carries a small fan that can be rotated through 180<sup>o</sup>.<br>
 When the fan as at direction 0<sup>o</sup>, the fan causes the maximum acceleration and the cart moves straight ahead with high speed.<br>
 When the fan is at direction 90<sup>o</sup>, the fan causes the maximum acceleration and the cart does not move.<br>
 When the fan is at direction 45<sup>o</sup>, the fan causes some acceleration and the cart moves slowly.<br>
 If you attach a vertical barrier to the cart in front of the fan, the cart does not move, even when the fan is at direction 90<sup>o</sup>.<br>
 Place masses on the cart to vary the acceleration and demonstrate Newton's Second Law.<br>
2. Fix a sail in front of a battery-powered fan on an air track cart or toy boat, or use a balloon to provide a wind source.<br>
 Put a battery-operated fan on a model sailing boat.<br>
 When it blows against the sail the boat does not move forward, because an equal and opposite force acts on the fan.<br>
 Put the fan on the shore where the wind from the fan can reach the sailing boat.<br>
 The wind from the fan blows the sailing boat forward.<br>
 If the fan is placed on the boat facing the rear there is some forward force.<br>
3. Fix a potable electric fan and six 1.5 v batteries connected in series on a roller skate or on a toy train carriage on rails.<br>
 Turn on the fan and the skate moves in the opposite direction.<br>
 Attach a strong cardboard sail at right angles to the axis of the skate and direction of the fan.<br>
 Turn on the fan and the skate or carriage does not move, because of the equal and opposite forces on it.<br>
4. Cut a beverage can with a ring on the top into two half parts along the diameter.<br>
 Use one half as the hull.<br>
 Cut two 40 cm wide strips off the other half of the jar.<br>
 Use adhesive tape to connect them into a longer strip.<br>
 Fold the strip into an L shape and put it into the hull then put a wood block of 30 mm x 30 mm x 10 mm on the bottom of the strip.<br>
 This is the sail of the boat.<br>
 Place the boat on the water at a large basin.<br>
 Blow the sail and observe the direction of the boat moving.<br>
 Use a candle according to the height of the sail.<br>
 Light the candle then paste it with waxen oil on the block.<br>
 Remove the position of the block to adjust the balance of the boat.<br>
 Take care to keep a certain distance from candle flame to the top of the sail.<br>
 Observe the movement of the boat now.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.2.12H">16.2.12</a> Press fingers together<br>
 Let your middle fingers just touch.<br>
 When you press the left middle finger with the right, you may find not only the left middle finder reacted, but also the finger to its right reacts.<br>
 Observe the changes in shape of the two fingers and whether they are the same.<br>
 Repeat the experiment using your left middle finger to press your right middle finger.<br>
 Use your right hand to clap your left hand then observe whether simultaneously the two hands feel pain.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.2.13H">16.2.13</a> Push a wheelbarrow<br>
<a href="../images/21.1.2b.gif">See diagram 21.1.2b</a>: Wheelbarrow.<br>
 Raise the handles of a wheelbarrow full of sand and push it towards a small hillock.<br>
 It may be difficult to push the wheelbarrow over the hillock unless you lower the handles until they are almost parallel to the ground.<br>
 By lowering the handles, you are applying a force in the direction of motion, i.e. tangential to the slope.<br>
If you push the wheelbarrow with handles raised, a component of the force you apply is into the hillock, which also increases frictional loss, with only the component of force parallel to the slope
 being<br>utilized to move the wheelbarrow over the hillock.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.2.14H">16.2.14</a> Thrust and recoil<br>
 Thrust and recoil, recoil from a bow and arrow, catapult, hose, rifle<br>
 Thrust is force applied on a surface in a direction perpendicular or normal to the surface is called thrust, a reaction force of Newton's laws of motion.<br>
 A thrust force tends to increase velocity or momentum.<br>
 A drag force tends to decrease velocity or momentum.<br>
 The propellor of a ship or plane and a jet or rocket engine exerts this propulsive force.<br>
 The recoil of a gun describes how it springs back with the force of discharge.<br>
 Some guns have a hydraulic cylinder that compresses and so absorbs the shock of recoil and decelerates the rearward thrust of the firearm.<br>
Experiments<br>
1. Use a bow and arrow or catapult.<br>
 The force exerted by one arm to pull back equals the force used to hold steady the bow or the fork of the catapult.<br>
2. Hold a hose in your hand then turn of the tap.<br>
 Feel the backwards force on your hand.<br>
 Drop the hose on the ground and see it move backwards in a snake-like motion.<br>
3. Fire a rifle.<br>
 As the bullet leaves the rifle, you feel the recoil force on your shoulder.<br>
 When large guns are fired, they tend to move backwards.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.2.15H">16.2.15</a> Vanishing weight<br>
 Pull a strip of paper from between two weights.<br>
 It will tear unless dropped.<br>
 Drop a mass on a spring scale.<br>
 Drop an object with a second object hanging by a rubber band.<br>
 Stretch a rubber band over the edge of a container and drop.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.2.16H">16.2.16</a> Weight and pressure<br>
<a href="../images/4.188x.gif">See diagram 4.188</a>: Weight and pressure.<br>
 1. Use a block of wood with two different dimensions, e.g. 10 cm X 15 cm.<br>
 Put the block on Plasticine (modelling clay) or mud, with the larger face down.<br>
 Repeat the experiment with the smaller face down.<br>
 Record the different depths the block sinks.<br>
 Add a weight to the block to make it sink deeper.<br>
 When the smaller face is down, the block sinks deeper than when the larger face is down.<br>
 Pressure = force/area.<br>
 The force down, i.e. the weight, is the same, but the area of the smaller face is less than the area of the larger face.<br>
 When the block has the smaller face down, it exerts more pressure.<br>
2. Stand on mud wearing flat shoes and high heel shoes.<br>
You sink deeper wearing high heel shoes, because the surface area is less.<br>
Formerly, ladies could not wear high heel shoes in commercial aircraft, because the pointed heel might make holes in the aluminium floor.<br>
3. Cut with a sharp knife and a blunt knife, or 
 dig with a sharp spade and a blunt spade.<br>
 You can cut deeper with the sharp knife, because the surface area of the knife edge is less and applies more pressure.<br>
 Pressure = force / area, so the greater the area, the less the pressure.<br>

<a href="../images/16.166.gif">See diagram 16.166</a>: Ladder against a wall.<br>
 A model ladder leans against a heavy wooden box and a mass is hung from a rung.<br>
 Move the mass higher and higher or adjust the angle smaller and smaller until the ladder slips.<br>
 Different materials can be used for the surfaces to show different static friction.<br>
 Set a model ladder against a box and move a weight up a rung at a time.<br>
 Forces on a ladder:<br>
 Mount a set of wheels at the top of a ladder and place some shoes at the bottom to decrease friction and climb the ladder until you fall down.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.3.2H">16.3.2</a> Coin keeps moving<br>
 Use a wood block with a slippery surface.<br>
 Put the wood block on a slippery tabletop.<br>
 Put a coin on the wood block.<br>
 Keeping your other hand at the front, hit the wood block with your hand so that it moves quickly in a straight path on the table.<br>
 When your hand stops the wood block suddenly, the coin continues to move horizontally.<br>
 If you place a heavy bag next to the back window of a motorcar and the car stops suddenly, the bag keeps going and hits you on the back of the head!<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.3.3H">16.3.3</a> Coin snatching<br>
 1. Bend your arm back so that your forearm is horizontal and you hand is beside your ear.<br>
 Place a pile or coins or bottle tops on the edge of the elbow.<br>
 Bring the arm forward quickly and catch the coins in mid air.<br>
 This trick is used in a children's game to see who can catch the most bottle tops, because of inertia the coins remain in place in space until the force of gravity applies to them.<br>
 The distance travelled in a fall, S = gt<sup>2</sup>.<br>
 However, if the vertical component of the acceleration of the hand &gt; g, then the hand can catch the coins.<br>
 2. The rules for coin snatching (World series)<br>
* The coins are to be placed on the elbow.<br>
* All coins must be caught in one snatch and the snatch is to be achieved on a downward beat of the same arm and the coins caught palm down.<br>
If not all of the coins that are stacked are caught, the attempt is still valid, but only those that are caught would count.<br>
In this instance, the documentation should mention both the number of coins stacked and the number successfully caught.<br>
* Once they are ready on the elbow, the coins are not be touched by the hand that is not being used to catch them.<br>
* No adhesive of any sort may be used.<br>
* The coins to be used are 10 p coins in Great Britain, or in other countries coins weighting at least 10 g (0.35 oz), and having a diameter of at least 2.8 cm (1 1/2 in).<br>

<a href="../images/16.4.8.gif">See diagram 16.4.8</a>: Flick a card under a coin.<br>
 1. Use the fingers to flick a coin, e.g. an American one cent piece, at the coin at the bottom of the pile, e.g. American nickels.<br>
 The bottom coin leaves the pile.<br>
 The bottom coin of the pile must be thicker, or the same thickness, as the coin flicked towards it.<br>
2. Strike the lowest coin sharply with a ruler to dislodge it without the pile falling over.<br>
3. Strike the lowest coin with a tight string held in both hands and pulled quickly against the bottom coin or place loose string against the lowest coin and pull the string tight by pulling at both ends.<br>
4. Stack 10 coins on a plate.<br>
 Lift the plate about 10 cm over the table.<br>
 Quickly lower the plate and pull it towards you.<br>
 The stack of coins falls onto the table with each coin keeping the position it had on the plate.<br>
5. Use two coins with a big mass difference.<br>
 Support the playing card on two fingers of your left hand.<br>
 Shoot the card off quickly with the index of your right hand and let the coin fall on the fingers of your left hand.<br>
 Some people can balance the coin on the card on one fingertip, flick the card and let the coin remained balanced on the finger tip.<br>
6. Put a stiff cardboard playing card on a beaker.<br>
 Put a coin on the card.<br>
 Flick the card quickly with your forefinger.<br>
 The card moves horizontally, but the coin drops vertically into the beaker.<br>
7. Bend a strip of semi-rigid paper into an arc so that the ends are within the rim of the beaker.<br>
 Put a coin on the strip of paper.<br>
 Flick the strip of paper quickly with your forefinger so that it moves away.<br>
 The coin falls down into the beaker.<br>
8. Cut a 1 cm wide hoop from a plastic drink bottle.<br>
 Stand it over the mouth of a wide mouth jar.<br>
 Put a coin on top of the hoop.<br>
 Flick the inside the hoop with your index finger.<br>
 The hoop moves away and the coin drops into the jar.<br>
9. Put a coin on a stiff playing card placed over the mouth of an empty glass.<br>
 The coin must be placed over the edge of the glass.<br>
 Try to remove the card, but not the coin.<br>
 Flick the card away quickly with your finger.<br>
 The coin falls into the glass.<br>
 The coin does not move sideways, because of its inertia.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.3.5H">16.3.5</a> Inertia in daily life<br>
1. An empty bottle on the floor of a bus or train will roll forwards or backwards as the bus or train slows or accelerates.<br>
2. Forcibly shake the dust or water off clothing.<br>
3. A worker digging a drain must stop the shovel suddenly in the air when he throws the shovel from the bottom of the drain to the ground.<br>
 Scoop up a spade full of dry earth.<br>
 Pitch the earth away from you.<br>
 When the spade stops, the earth keeps moving, because of its inertia.<br>
4. When a bus or train stops suddenly the passengers may fall forward due to their inertia.<br>
5. Do not leave objects on a shelf below the back window of a car.<br>
If the car stops suddenly, the objects will keep moving due to inertia and perhaps hit the passengers.<br>
6. When a car is towing a trailer or caravan, applying the brakes suddenly is very dangerous while turning.<br>
 The car slows or stops, but the trailer or caravan keeps moving by inertia in the direction when you applied the brakes.<br>
 The car and trailer will "jack-knife"!<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.3.6H">16.3.6</a> Inertia of a stone<br>
<a href="../images/16.240.gif">See diagram 16.240</a>: Inertia of a stone.<br>
<a href="../images/16.155m.gif">See diagram 16.155</a>: Inertia of a heavy ball.<br>
 1.0 Use a stone weighing about 1 kg.<br>
 Suspend the stone with a light string that is just strong enough to support the stone.<br>
 Attach two pieces of the same string to the stone and let them hang down.<br>
* Grasp firmly the lower end of one hanging string, B, and give it a quick jerk with a sudden impulsive pull.<br>
 The lower string breaks and leaves the stone suspended by string A, because of the inertia of the stone.<br>
 If you leave some slack in string B then pull it you have a greater force.<br>
 Also you can attach a short iron bar to the end of string B.<br>
* Pull steadily on the other hanging string, B.<br>
 The upper string A breaks and the stone falls.<br>
 The steady application of force has set the stone in motion.<br>
 The stone was "reluctant" to accelerate, because of its inertia.<br>
2.0 Suspend a stone with a piece of thin cotton thread just able to withstand the weight of the stone.<br>
 Tie another piece of the same thread around the middle of the stone and let the end of the thread hang down.<br>
 Suspend the stone from a firm support.<br>
 Quickly pull the lower thread hanging down.<br>
 The thread hanging down breaks, but the thread suspending the stone does not break.<br>
 The stone remains suspended.<br>
 The inertia of the stone slows the transfer of downward force to the upper suspending thread, so the lower thread breaks.<br>
* Suspend the stone again.<br>
 Slowly pull the lower thread hanging down.<br>
 The thread suspending the stone breaks and the stone falls down.<br>
 You evenly distribute the downward force in the two threads.<br>
 So this force and the weight of the stone break the upper suspending thread.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.3.7H">16.3.7</a> Inertia tricks, tablecloth pull<br>
<a href="../images/16.4.9m.gif">See diagram 16.4.9</a>: Tablecloth pull.<br>
 1. Lay a tablecloth on a table with a smooth surface, e.g. glass top table.<br>
 The tablecloth should itself be smooth and have no bumps or embroidery in it.<br>
 Place heavy objects on the tablecloth, e.g. a heavy plate.<br>
 Pull the tablecloth quickly towards you as fast as possible.<br>
 The heavy object remains on the bare table.<br>
 It does not move towards you, because of its inertia and insufficient lateral force is acting on it.<br>
 The heavy object is at a state of rest and will remain at rest unless a force acts on it.<br>
 The horizontal force on the dishes is due to kinetic friction between the dishes and the tablecloth as you pull the tablecloth horizontally.<br>
 If you pull the tablecloth very quickly, friction between the dishes and the table surface rapidly removes any horizontal velocity of the dishes.<br>
 This experiment shows Newton's first law and impulse momentum.<br>
 Both the force and the time during which it acts are small resulting in a small change in momentum of the dishes.<br>
2. Drape a smooth cloth over the edge of a table.<br>
 Put a cup of water on the cloth.<br>
 Quickly pull the away cloth leaving the cup of water on the table.<br>
 (Sir Isaac Newton is supposed to have done this experiment to demonstrate inertia.)<br>
3. Put dining table objects, e.g. plates, bottles, cups, bottle of water, on a silky smooth cloth.<br>
 The objects remain standing if the cloth is pulled out sharply from beneath, thus demonstrating the inertia of the objects involved.<br>
 Always place the smooth silky surface down facing the table.<br>
 Some physics lecturers ask students to repeat the demonstration after secretly placing a small ball of blue tack between the table and tablecloth.<br>
 The objects do not remain standing.<br>
4. Put a coin on a stiff playing card placed over the mouth of an empty glass.<br>
 The coin must be placed over the edge of the glass.<br>
 Try to remove the card, but not the coin.<br>
 Flick the card away quickly with your finger.<br>
 The coin falls into the glass.<br>
 The coin does not move sideways, because of its inertia.<br>
 Snap a playing card out from under a tall object.<br>
 Snap a playing card from under a steel ball.<br>
5. Place a bottle on a strip of paper.<br>
 Pull the paper quickly from under the bottle with no motion of the bottle.<br>
 Jerk a sheet of paper out from under a thin steel cylinder.<br>
6. Cut a strip of paper the size of a ruler.<br>
 Place the strip at right angles half over the side of a table.<br>
 Put an object, e.g. a pencil, on the part of the strip over the table.<br>
 Hold the end of the strip out so that the part of the strip not over the table is almost horizontal.<br>
 Use your pointing finger of the other hand to hit the middle of the strip not over the table.<br>
 The pencil does not move and the strip falls down.<br>
7. Stand an empty soft drink bottle, open end down, on one end of a bank note, e.g. a dollar bill.<br>
 Roll a pencil over the other end of the banknote.<br>
 The drink bottle has a high centre of gravity.<br>
 Jerk the pencil very quickly and the bottle remains in place.<br>
 Pull the pencil slowly and the bottle moves with it.<br>
 Pull the pencil more quickly and the bottle falls over.<br>
8. Place a light beer mat ("coaster") over an empty glass.<br>
 Place a match stick, with head cut off, over the beer mat.<br>
 Place a 10 cents coin over the match stick.<br>
 Using your first finger and thumb, flick the beer mat forward.<br>
 The coin drops into the glass with a tinkling sound.<br>
 Some people can repeat this experiment with an egg balanced on a matchbox.<br>
9. Make a pile of books.<br>
 Grasp the book at the bottom of the pile and pull very quickly.<br>
 You can remove the bottom book without upsetting the pile, because of the inertia of the books above it.<br>
10. Make a pile of coins or checkers.<br>
 Strike the lower most coin sharply with a ruler to dislodge it without the pile falling over.<br>
 Repeat the experiment by dislodging the lowermost coin with a tight string held in both hands and pulled quickly against the bottom coin.<br>
11. Scoop up a spade full of dry earth.<br>
 Pitch the earth away from you.<br>
 When the spade stops, the earth keeps moving, because of its inertia.<br>
12. Place a light beer mat ("coaster"), over an empty glass.<br>
 Place a match stick, with head cut off, over the beer mat.<br>
 Place a 10 cents coin over the match stick.<br>
 Using your first finger and thumb, flick the beer mat forward.<br>
 The coin drops into the glass with a tinkling sound.<br>
 Some people can repeat this experiment with an egg balanced on a matchbox.<br>
13. Cut a round potato half way through with a knife.<br>
 Hold the knife horizontally with the potato stuck to it.<br>
 Hit the back of the knife with the back of another knife.<br>
 You cut the potato in halves, because it stayed at rest when you hit the knife.<br>
 Put a round potato on a cutting board and stab it down the middle with a sharp knife.<br>
 The potato stays in place with the end of the knife in it.<br>
 Hold the knife and potato with the knife handle down and hit the cutting board with the end of the knife handle.<br>
 The potato moves down the blade of the knife.<br>
 The potato stayed in motion when hitting the cutting board stopped the movement of the knife.<br>
14. Make a pile of coins or checkers.<br>
 Strike the lower most coin sharply with a ruler to dislodge it without the pile falling over.<br>
 Repeat the experiment by dislodging the lowermost coin with a tight string held in both hands and pulled quickly against the bottom coin.<br>
15. Make a pile of books.<br>
 Grasp the book at the bottom of the pile and pull very quickly.<br>
 You can remove the bottom book without upsetting the pile, because of the inertia of the books above it.<br>
16. Build a tower using children's building blocks.<br>
 Hold the back of a ball point pen with a spring clip next to a middle block.<br>
 Discharge the spring clip.<br>
 The middle block flies out, but the tower does not fall over.<br>
17. Place an egg on a matchbox case and put this on a bread board over a basin of water.<br>
 Pick up the breadboard then move it very quickly to the side.<br>
 The egg has great inertia so it falls into the water.<br>
 The matchbox case has little inertia so it moves to the side.<br>
18. Suspend two heavy iron balls hung separately between lengths of string, pull slowly on one and jerk quickly on the other.<br>
19. Attach a rope between a heavy iron ball and a hammer head, so that a fast swing of the hammer takes up the slack and breaks the rope without moving the ball.<br>
20. Place a lead block or a brick on your hand and hit it with a hammer!<br>
21. Hit nails into a 50 kg wood block placed on the hand.<br>
22. Suspend two large cylinders, 3 kg wood, and 50 kg iron, then compare displacements when struck by a hammer.<br>

 1. Put carbon copy paper on a slippery table top with the long edge of the paper parallel and to near the edge of the table.<br>
 Separately put three weights of 50 g and 100 g and 500 g on the carbon paper on a line parallel to the long edge of the paper.<br>
 Quickly pull the carbon paper off the table.<br>
 The weights fall on the table.<br>
 Pull the carbon paper with different speeds to find which weight is the easiest and most difficult to move along with the paper.<br>
 2. Repeat the experiments with three identical drink cups containing different amounts of water.<br>
 3. Some people can pull a table cloth off a table laid with glasses of water and never spill the water or break the glasses.<br>
 However, this trick needs a lot of practice.<br>

1. Use a glass tube with an open-mouthed end and inner diameter more than 10 cm.<br>
Put it on a horizontal plane.<br>
Put coloured water into the horizontal glass tube with a glass tube or a drinking straw with a small rubber ball.<br>
After the water is at rest, forcibly hit the end of the glass tube with a small stick.<br>
Observe the movement of the coloured water when the glass springs out in a straight path.<br>
2. Cut off 1 / 4 of a side wall of a large plastic drink bottle.<br>
Put a big drop of water on the upper edge of the inner wall.<br>
The drop of water runs down to the lowest level then moves some distance up the other side.<br>
The drop continues to move forwards and backwards with decreasing height up the side wall until it settles at the lowest level.<br>

<a href="../images/16.241.gif">See diagram 16.241</a>: Inertia with two bucket pendulums.<br>
 1. To experience the relationship of the inertia of an object to its mass use two buckets and pieces of string.<br>
 Tie each bucket to the ceiling.<br>
 Fill one bucket full of sand, but let the other bucket remain empty.<br>
 Push the two buckets and compare which bucket is easier to push.<br>
 Try to stop the buckets moving and compare which bucket is more difficult to stop.<br>
2. Use long strings to suspend from the ceiling two large identical buckets.<br>
 Fill one bucket with sand.<br>
 Use the hook of a spring balance to push each bucket.<br>
 Note what force is necessary to start the buckets moving.<br>
 Use your hand to stop the buckets when they are moving.<br>
 You can feel the difference in inertia of the two buckets.<br>

Experiments<br>
1. Tie the end of the string of a helium balloon to the parking brake.<br>
In a motor vehicle travelling at constant speed, the balloon maintains its position relative to the parking brake.<br>
* If the motor vehicle accelerates forward, the balloon moves forward relative to the parking brake.<br>
* If the motor vehicle reduces speed due to braking, the balloon moves backwards relative to the parking brake.<br>
* If the motor vehicle turns a corner, the balloon moves inwards.<br>
* If the motor vehicle turns to the right, the balloon moves to the left.<br>
* If the motor vehicle turns to the left, the balloon moves to the right.<br>
 The contents of the motor vehicle, including the air and the driver, have inertia.<br>
 The helium balloon floats towards the air of lowest density.<br>
 When the motor vehicle accelerates, air tends to accumulate in the back and the drives feels a reverse force.<br>
 When the motor vehicle brakes, air tends to accumulate in the front and the driver feels a forward force.<br>
 In a high speed turn, the driver feels an outward force as the balloon moves inwards.<br>
2. A science teacher purchased a remote-controlled toy helicopter small enough to fly under remote control in his car.<br>
He reported that the toy helicopter moved in much the same way as the balloon in the experiment above, but other science teachers expressed doubts about the teacher's interpretation of the behaviour of the toy helicopter in a speeding car.<br>

 Load the cups on a torsion pendulum with various masses.<br>
 A horizontal leaf spring acts as an inertial balance if you place masses on a platform supported by horizontal leaf springs.<br>
 You can use an inertia balance to measure mass independent of the earth's gravitational force.<br>
 It has two platforms connected by two horizontal spring steel blades.<br>
 A cylinder can rest in the hole in one platform or be suspended by a hook.<br>
 Calibrate the apparatus by determining the vibration frequency for known platform loads using the platform with the hole.<br>
 Calculate the period in seconds for each load and plot period against it.<br>

 Repeat the experiment with the spin dryer 3 / 4 full of wet clothing and make the same observations.<br>
 The more wet clothing in the spin dryer, the more rotations when you turn it off, because of the greater rotational inertia.<br>
 The clothing dried off is always distributed equably with more on the outside.<br>
If the spin dryer contains only pieces of wet clothing, the spin dryer barrel does not rotate normally, because of unequal distribution of mass.<br>

The positions of the body, arms and legs of athletes affect their rotational inertia through affecting the distribution of their mass.<br>
An ice skater can start a spin on one toe with one leg extended and both arms extended (I is large and ω is small), but when the ice skater brings both legs and both arms together (now I is small and ω is large), the moment of inertia decreases and speed of spin increases, the skater spins much faster due to conservation of angular momentum.<br>

Spinning eggs, forces with a fresh egg and hard-boiled egg<br>
1. Use your fingers to spin a fresh egg and a hard-boiled egg end-on.<br>
The hard-boiled egg spins longer, because the inertia of the fluid contents  of the fresh egg brings it to rest sooner.<br>
2. Use your fingers to spin a fresh egg and a hard-boiled egg end-on, i.e. about its short axis.<br>
 The hard-boiled egg spins faster and longer.<br>
 The raw egg soon slows, because of the inertia of liquids and friction within the egg.<br>
 The spinning raw egg damps more quickly than a boiled egg due to internal  friction.<br>
 The inertia of its liquid contents exerts a drag effect that kills the spin.<br>
3. If a spinning hard-boiled egg is touched it, stops spinning, but if a spinning raw egg is touched, it stops spinning, then weakly continues to spin when the finger is removed.<br>
 The raw egg starts spinning again, because internal liquids are still moving when the outer shell has been stopped by the finger.<br>
 Centripetal forces are different with spinning fresh and hard-boiled eggs.<br>
4. Centripetal forces with a fresh and hard-boiled egg<br>
 Use your fingers to spin a fresh egg and a hard-boiled egg end-on, i.e. spin it about its short axis.<br>

 The fresh egg slows, because of internal motion and viscous friction.<br>
  
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.5.1H">16.5.1</a> Newton's first law of motion, inertia<br>
 Bottle Jet Drag Racer Lab Pack (Pack of 12), Newton's laws (toy product).<br>
<a href="../images/16.4.0.gif">See diagram 16.4.0</a>: Forces.<br>
 Newton's first law (Isaac Newton, 1642 -1727, England), the law of inertia<br>
 A body continues in a state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line unless it is acted upon by an external force<br>
 Inertia is the property of a body, proportional to its mass, in that it continues in a state orest or uniform motion in the absence of an external force.<br>
 Inertia is the "reluctance" of a body to accelerate.<br>
 Unless a force acts on a body, its velocity remains constant.<br>
 The greater the mass, the greater the inertia of the body.<br>
 Inertial mass, m, is the measure of an object's reluctance to accelerate, usually measured in kilograms, kg.<br>
Mach's principle (Ernst Mach, 18381916, Austria), states that the inertia of a body is caused by the gravitational interaction between that body and all the bodies in the rest of the universe.<br>
So if a body could be isolated from the gravitational forces from all other bodies in the universe, it would have zero inertia.<br>

<a href="../images/16.4.2.gif">See diagram 16.4.2</a>: Normal reaction.<br>
 The mutual actions of two bodies on one another are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, whether the bodies are moving or at rest.<br>
 A body pulled along a surface by a string exerts a force on the string equal and opposite to the force exerted on it by the string.<br>
 If an object A exerts a force on object B, B exerts an equal and opposite force on A.<br>
 This is Newton's third law of motion.<br>
 It shows the fact that forces always interact between objects and thus always occur in pairs.<br>
 When one object exerts a force on another, the second object exerts an equal and opposite force on the first object.<br>
 To every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.<br>
 When an object is resting on a horizontal surface, the normal reaction perpendicular to the surface balances its weight.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.5.2H">16.5.2</a> Newton's second law of motion, force<br>
 1. The rate of change of a moving body is proportional to the force acting to produce the change<br>
 Time rate of change of momentum of a body is proportional to the impressed force and takes place in the direction in which the force acts.<br>
 The effect of an unbalanced force on an object is to cause it to accelerate in the direction of this resultant force.<br>
 Momentum is the quantity motion of a moving body equal to the product of its mass and velocity, mv.<br>
 2. Force is proportional to the time rate of change of momentum it produces, i.e. force x time rate of velocity x mass.<br>
 Force mass x acceleration.<br>
 However, if the unit of force is defined as equal to that force that will produce unit acceleration in unit mass, F = m x a, F = ma.<br>
 3. The SI unit of force is a newton (N) (1 newton = 1 kg m s<sup>-2</sup>). F = ma, where F = force in newton, N, m = mass in kilograms, kg, and a = acceleration in metre / second, m s<sup>-2</sup>.<br>
 Measure force directly with a spring balance.<br>
 4. When a single force replaces a system of forces, this force is called the resultant.<br>
 5. If an object acts on another object and causes its acceleration, the measure of this action is a vector quantity, which is called force.<br>
 Forces are caused by the interactions of pairs of bodies.<br>
 The effect of an unbalanced applied force on an object is to cause it to accelerate in the direction of this resultant force.<br>
 Acceleration is directly proportional to this force and inversely proportional to inertial mass of the object.<br>
 6. Weight of an object is the gravitational force exerted on it by the Earth, F = mg, F = weight in newton, N, m = mass in kilograms, kg, g = Earth's gravitational field strength at the place =<br>9.8 N / kg, 9.8 N kg<sup>-1</sup>.<br>
 7. Free fall acceleration due to gravity = 9.8 m / sec<sup>2</sup>.<br>
8. Impulse is the change in momentum of an object.<br>
 F = change in mv / change in t, so impulse, F x change in t = change in mv. Impulse = change in momentum.<br>
 For a given change in momentum, the longer time the force acts, the smaller the force needed for a change in momentum.<br>
To reduce effects of motor vehicle accidents, when bringing a vehicle to zero velocity a long impact time reduces the collision force, e.g. crumpling of forward parts of the motor vehicle after a collision.<br>

<a href="../images/36.103.gif">See diagram 36.103</a>: Balloon-powered rocket.<br>
 1. Designs for balloon-powered rockets usually involve placing the balloon in a container, e.g. plastic drink bottle, inflating the balloon, sealing the inlet by twisting, then releasing the balloon.<br>
 Air rushes out of the inlet to cause an equal and opposite force forwards.<br>
 However, the motion of the rocket is unpredictable, so the container should be harnessed, e.g. attached to a drinking straw threaded on a taut line.<br>
2. Attach a drinking straw to the side of a long balloon.<br>
 Pass a thin wire through the drinking straw, pull the wire until it is tight, and attach it to the opposite sides of the room.<br>
 Put a cardboard cylinder in the nozzle of the balloon.<br>
 Inflate the balloon and then release it suddenly so that the balloon travels along the wire.<br>
3. Inflate a long balloon and seal the mouth by tying tightly with string.<br>
 Attach a drinking straw to the balloon along its long axis with adhesive tape.<br>
 Attach a long fishing line to a post and pull the other end tight.<br>
 Attach something thin and heavy, e.g. a needle, to the end of the fishing line then thread it through the drinking straw.<br>
 Pull tight again to the end of the fishing line now with the balloon attached to it.<br>
 Cut the string around the mouth of the balloon and watch the balloon move along the string.<br>
4. Make a balloon-powered rocket.<br>
 Attach a drinking straw to the side of a long balloon with adhesive tape.<br>
 Pass a wire through the drinking straw, attach each end of the wire to fence posts and tighten the wire.<br>
 Inflate the balloon then release it.<br>
 The balloon travels along the wire.<br>
5. Make a drinking straw rocket.<br>
 Fit a one-hole stopper to a plastic drink bottle.<br>
 Attach a thin glass tube, open at both ends, through the one-hole stopper.<br>
 Seal one end of a drink straw with Plasticine or modelling clay and place it over the thin glass tube, sealed end out.<br>
 Squeeze the plastic drink bottle suddenly and the drinking straw shoots out like a rocket.<br>
 Air from the plastic drink bottle is forced out through the thin glass tube to increase air pressure in the drinking straw.<br>
 Air rushes out through the back open end of the drinking straw so the opposite reaction occurs causing the straw rocket to move forwards.<br>
6. Make a balloon-powered rocket.<br>
 Use adhesive plaster to paste several small iron rings to the side of a long shaped balloon.<br>
 Use a straight slippery thin iron wire (if existing iron wire is not straight, you may step on it then rotate it several times so that it will became straight.)<br>
 Insert the iron wire through the iron rings and fasten the iron wire to any two rings.<br>
 Put a small glass's end into the mouth of the balloon.<br>
 Use white adhesive plaster air proof the connecting part of the glass and the balloon.<br>
 Hang the glass to two rings on the iron wire with a piece of string.<br>
Make sure he glass parallel to the iron wire.<br>
 Now this is a balloon-driven "rocket".<br>
 The end of the iron wire near the bottom of the balloon is the rocket head.<br>
 Draw the balloon backward to the other end of the iron wire.<br>
 Inflate the balloon then release it suddenly.<br>
 Observe how far the "rocket" can go ahead.<br>
 Plot a graph using the times of blowing as x-axis and the distance of the "rocket" gone as y-axis.<br>

This toy boat has a simple metal boiler made from a beverage can, or very thin metal or even a coiled copper tube connected to a copper tube or two drinking straws, at a small angle, leading out of the rear of the toy boat.<br>
 The boiler and tubes are almost filled with water.<br>
 A small lighted candle is placed under the "flash boiler" to convert water in the boiler to steam that pushes out the column of water in the rear tubes or tubes.<br>
 This backward force causes the forward movement of the boat in accordance with Newton's third law of motion.<br>
Any remaining steam in the boiler condenses to reduce the pressure and so water enters the boiler and rear tubes again.<br>
 However, whereas the water cylinder expelled from the tubes moves in one direction backwards the water re-entering the rear tubes enters from<br>
 all directions so there is a net forward force to keep the<br>boat moving forward.<br>
The "pop pop" noise is caused by water column moving backwards and forwards in the tubes and so expanding and compressing the contents of the boiler.<br>

Angular momentum, L = I × ω.<br>
When there is no net torque on an object its angular velocity and angular momentum are constant.<br>
Conservation of angular momentum:<br>
When the sum of torques acting on an object = 0, the angular momentum is constant.<br>
The greater the value of angular momentum, the more torque is needed to change its direction so bullets, rockets and even footballs can be aimed more accurate if spin stabilized.<br>
Similarly, a spinning top stays upright until friction causes it to lose angular momentum.<br>
An ice skater can start a spin on one toe with one leg extended and both arms extended (I is large and ω is small), but when the ice skater brings both legs and both arms together (now I is small and ω is large) the skater spins much faster due to conservation of angular momentum.<br>
Angular momentum of the earth = moment of inertia × angular velocity = (1 × 10<sup>38</sup>) × (7 × 10<sup>-5</sup>) = 7 × 10<sup>33</sup> newton
