<a href="./images/31.5.14.gif">See diagram 31 5 14</a>: Induction coil.<br>
(H. D. Ruhmkorff, 1803- 1877, Germany, France)<br>
1. An induction coil (spark coil, Ruhmkorff induction coil) is a kind of transformer where low voltage direct current in a primary coil is interrupted to induce higher voltage in the secondary coil.<br>
The induction coil contains a primary circuit (a few turns of thick wire), a switch, a rheostat (variable resistance), a battery, a make-and-break (interrupter), and a condenser in parallel with the make-and- break.<br>
 The secondary circuit is many turns of thin wire wound on the primary coil, with a spark gap.<br>
 The greatest distance between the spheres of the spark gap is a measure of the induced emf.<br>
 An iron core usually consists of a bunch of insulated iron wires, which can be placed within the primary coil.<br>
 Changing magnetic field created by the primary circuit can induce a changing voltage and/or current in the secondary circuit.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="31.1.2H">31.1.2</a> Rhumkorff coil<br>
See: <a href="./commercial/Commercial3.html#Induction">Induction</a>, IEC Rhumkorff coil, (Commercial).<br>
IEC Ruhmkorff induction coil, tungsten vibrating points, high quality capacitor reduces arcing, fuse fitted to protect primary winding, secondary winding contains thousands of turns and can be slide from the primary winding to reduce coupling, runs on 6 to 9 volts, spark length 25 - 30 cm, 
removable and adjustable needle points with insulated handles, 300 mm, 125 mm, 110 mm.<br>
 High voltage induction coil with a removable secondary winding.<br>
 The fused primary is wound on a laminated electrical-steel coil, it requires 6 to 9V DC, input is via 4 mm banana plugs.<br>
 The vibrating contacts are easily adjusted and are made of tungsten.<br>
The coil produces a 25 mm spark between adjustable needle points, which plug into 4 mm sockets, removing the points allows the high voltage to be fed to other equipment.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="31.1.3H">31.1.3</a> Mutual inductance<br>
Mutual inductance of two circuits refers to the size of the voltage in the secondary circuit induced by changes in the current of the primary circuit.<br>
The unit of mutual inductance is the henry, H.<br>
Mutual inductance for two adjacent circuits is the emf induced in one circuit caused by the unit rate of change in the current flowing though the other circuit.<br>
In the induction coil, the induced emf is proportional to the number of turns per unit length of the primary circuit to the number of turns in the secondary circuit, and is proportional to the time rate of change of current in the primary circuit.<br>
 When an iron core is placed inside the primary coil the currents magnetizes the iron to increase the induced emf in the secondary coil.<br>
 The back emf can flow across the gap in the make and break causing a spark.<br>
 However, instead this current can charge a condenser in parallel with the make and break.<br>
The charged condenser immediately discharges to send current through the primary circuit in a direction opposite to the original current.<br>
When the change in magnetic flux from the primary coil is experienced by the secondary coil, an emf is induced in the secondary coil.<br>
The emf = M × (change in primary coil current / change in time), or M × (time rate of change in the primary current), where M = the mutual inductance of that 2 coil system.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="31.1.4H">31.1.4</a> Self-inductance<br>
<a href="./images/31.5.15.gif">See diagram 31.5.15</a>: Self-inductance.<br>
Self-inductance refers to a circuit creating changing magnetic flux through itself, which can induce an opposing voltage in itself.<br>
The unit of self-inductance is the henry.<br>
When current is started or stopped in a conductor, an induced emf occurs in that conductor, self-induction, with direction such as to oppose the change (Lenz's law).<br>
 So when the current starts to flow, the self-induced emf opposes the rise in current, back emf.<br>
When the current is broken, the back emf tends to cause the current to keep flowing to cause the current to falls gradually to zero instead of falling instantly.<br>
The unit of self-inductance, the henry, is the self-inductance of a circuit in which the back emf is 1 volt when the current alters at the rate of 1 ampere per second.<br>
When AC passes through a coil, the changing magnetic flux induces a back emf in the coil, which opposes the changing current.<br>
 Self-inductance of the coil is measured in henry, L.<br>
 The current lags behind the emf by a quarter of a cycle, 90<sup>o</sup>.<br>
 Self-inductance, inductance, occurs when a coil with a changing current induces an emf, in itself.<br>
 So = L ( I / t) henry (H), where 1 H = 1 V.s / A.<br>
Coils are turns of insulated copper wire to increase inductance depending on how many turns, distance between turns, diameter of the oil, and what they are wound on.<br>
For inductance, self inductance, L, in an AC circuit, when the AC passes through the coil the changing magnetic flux induces a "back emf " in the coil that opposes the changing current.<br>
 While magnetic flux is changing inside a coil, a back emf is induced, which opposes the changing current.<br>
 emf = L × (change in current / change in time) = L × (rate of change of current), where L = self-inductance constant of the coil.<br>
 The unit of self-inductance is the henry, H.<br>
 One 1 henry, H, = emf of 1 volt induced in a circuit by electric current change of 1 ampere per second.<br>
Self-inductance occurs when AC passes through a coil, because, if the current in a coil changes, the magnetic flux through the coil caused by the current also changes, so the changing current induces an emf in the same coil.<br>
 The current lags behind the emf by a quarter of a cycle (90<sup>o</sup>).<br>
 Back emf, E = -L I / t, where I / t is the rate of change of the current, and L is the self inductance of the coil measured in henry, H.<br>

 See: <a href="./commercial/Commercial3.html#WimshurstMachine">Wimshurst Machine</a>, (Commercial).<br>
<a href="./images/31.6.1.jpg">See diagram 31.6.1</a>: Wimshurst machine.<br>
 "Two parallel plates rotate in opposite directions.<br>
Charge due to friction in collected by combs then stored in two integrated high voltage capacitors, Leyden jars, connected in parallel to an adjustable spark gap up to 30 mm.<br>
The Wimshurst electrostatic generator consists of a system of electrophorus plates that operate in a continuous fashion to accumulate large amounts of positive and negative charge.<br>
 If positive charge on a disk on one plate A an opposite negative charge is induced on the nearest metal disk on the contra-rotating second plate B.<br>
 The connecting rods transfer an induced positive charge to disks on a diametrically opposite position of Plate A.<br>
 As the plates rotate the second plate B moves to a position where it induces a positive charge on the disk opposite it on plate A via the second set of connecting rods.<br>
 With continuous rotation positive charges accumulate at position A and negative charges at B.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="31.1.6H">31.1.6</a> Electrophorus<br>
See: <a href="./commercial/Commercial3.html#Electrostatics">Electrophorus</a>, (Commercial).<br>
<a href="./images/31.1.8.1.gif">See diagram 31.1.8.1</a>: Electrophorus.<br>
<a href="./images/31.147.gif">See diagram 31.147</a>: Many charges from one source.<br>
 An electrophorus is used to repeatedly generate static electricity by induction.<br>
 Discharge of an electrophorus shows the actual movement of charge.<br>
Alessandro Giuseppe Antonio Anastasio Volta (1745 - 1827), was the Italian experimenter who invented the "electroforo perpetuo", electrophorus, described in 1775.<br>
Luigi Galvani (1737 - 1798), another Italian experimenter did the first work on the twitching of frogs' legs by electric current.<br>
Volta took up the study of frogs' legs and showed Galvani that he was wrong about "animal electricity".<br>
Experiment<br>
1. The electrophorus has a flat metal disc A, with an insulating handle H, and a flat ebonite disc B, on an earthed metal sole S.<br>
 Rub plate B is rubbed with cats fur so that it acquires a negative charge.<br>
 Place disc A on disc B.<br>
 Neither A nor B are perfectly flat so contact between the discs is only at a few points.<br>
 So surfaces of the discs are mainly separated by a thin layer of air.<br>
 Disc A has charges induced on it.<br>
 Earth disc A by touching while it is still resting on B.<br>
 Electrons flow from disc A it to earth leaving a net positive charge on disc A.<br>
This net charge can be used as a source of charge so the above procedure can be repeated many times to build up charge on B, because in each charging cycle no charge is removed from B.<br>
The electrophorus works better if first dried in front of a radiator.<br>
2. The electrophorus consists of a flat metal disc with an insulated glass handle, a flat dielectric disc, e.g. ebonite, on an earthed metal sole.<br>
 If the flat dielectric disc is rubbed with silk it becomes positively charged by friction.<br>
When the flat metal disc is placed near or on the dielectric disc the lower surface of the metal disc become negatively charged by induction and so the upper surface of the metal disc becomes positively charged.<br>
 The upper surface of the metal disc is lightly touched with a finger to earth it and neutralize the positive charges.<br>
 Electrons cannot flow from the dielectric disc to the metal disk, because the dielectric disk is an insulator.<br>
 The metal disc now has a negative charge and can be lifted away with the insulated handle.<br>
 The two discs are not perfectly flat so these two discs touch at only a few places leaving a thin layer of air between them.<br>
 So the charging is mainly by induction and not by contact.<br>
 The procedure can be repeated many times to build up charge on the metal disc, because no charge has been removed from the dielectric disc.<br>
More work is required to lift the charged metal disc than if it were uncharged, because a force of attraction occurs between the charged metal disc and the oppositely charged dielectric disk.<br>
A spark occurs between a finger and the disc and this can occur again after the disc is recharged.<br>
The energy required comes from the person who lifts the disc, because more energy is needed the lift the charged disc than an uncharged disc, because of the force of attraction between the charged disc and the uncharged ebonite dielectric.<br>
3. Finger electrophorus shows electric field.<br>
Charge an electrophorus then trace a circle on it with your finger and probe the resulting field with a pith ball on a long thread.<br>
4. Use a neon discharge tube to show a flash by holding one end on the electrophorus and then touching the other end.<br>
5. Suspend an electrophorus by raising it off the plate with an attached helical spring.<br>
 Touch the disc to remove induced charge and see the spring lengthen.<br>
6. You can use a plastic gramophone record to make an electrophorus, but it slips about in use.<br>
 Also, some records contain materials that do not take the same charge consistently.<br>
 You can use a block of sulfur as an electrophorus. but handling it is difficult, because it tends to crumble.<br>
 Brass, copper and aluminium work as well as a copper plate.<br>
 Use short Perspex handles for convenience in storage with no metal screws protruding through the Perspex.<br>
 It will nor work without a nearly perfect insulator for a handle.<br>
 Nylon clothes may crackle when pulled over the head in dry weather, because nylon on is an insulator.<br>
 Friction with dry hair or even dry clothing electrifies the clothing.<br>
 In dry weather, the charges accumulate and, when earthed, cause noisy little sparks.<br>
 If the weather is humid, the charges generated can be conducted off the Perspex, through water vapour, on to the table and on to earth.<br>
 In damp weather dry the electrophorus with a radiator before use.<br>
7. Rub a sheet of Perspex, or slab of solidified sulfur or a plastic gramophone record, with fur.<br>
 The rubbing action wipes loose surface electrons off the Perspex onto the fur, so the Perspex becomes positively charged.<br>
 Hold a flat sheet of copper by an insulated handle on the charged Perspex.<br>
 The copper sheet and Perspex touch at only a few points although both seem flat.<br>
 The copper conductor has electrons that can move from atom to atom, unlike an insulator.<br>
 Positive charges from excess protons in the Perspex attract electrons from the flat sheet of copper when it comes into the electric field of the charged Perspex.<br>
 Unlike charges attract, so the underside of the copper disc becomes negatively charged, because it has extra electrons attracted to it, leaving the upper side with fewer electrons.<br>
 Touch the top of the sheet of copper with the finger.<br>
 The human body is damp and an electrical conductor, so when you touch the copper plate, electrons flow through your body to the top of the sheet of copper.<br>
 These electrons replace the electrons lost when the electrons in the sheet of copper flowed down to the Perspex.<br>
 When you remove your finger from the copper, these replacement electrons are left on the copper plate.<br>
 The electrons lost from your body are replaced by electrons moving up your body from the earth, if you are not wearing insulating rubber-soled shoes.<br>
 When you lift the copper plate, the extra electrons are trapped on it.<br>
You can produce a spark between the charged copper plate and your knuckle or the metal burner, because so many excess electrons are repelling each other on the charged plate that they can be "pushed off" the plate.<br>
If you touch the plate with one end of a conducting copper wire, and touch the other end to your finger or to the burner, these excess electrons quickly flow through the wire and form an electric current.<br>
An electric current through a wire is simply a movement of and electrons.<br>
When all the excess electrons have flowed from the plate through the wire, the current will stop.<br>
When the charged plate is surrounded by dry air there is no conductor through which the excess electrons can flow to earth.<br>
When the plate is brought close to a conducting object such as the metal of the burner, the excess electrons on the plate first repel any free or conduction electrons in the burner as far as possible away from that part of the metal closest to the charged plate.<br>
 This part of the metal then becomes positively charged.<br>
 Electrons now on the plate try to push each other and are attracted to the positive part of the metal burner.<br>
Some electrons leap from the charged plate through the air to the burner, knocking electrons out of air molecules and these join in the electric current passing from plate to burner, producing a quick spark and a sharp cracking noise.<br>
 In a charged electrophorus, charge leaks away due to conduction of electrons by moisture on the surface of the apparatus.<br>
 The original energy comes from you, because work is done in lifting the plate off against the attraction caused by the electric field.<br>
 Pulling the charged copper disc away from the oppositely charged Perspex sheet takes energy from you.<br>
 When you put your finger, which is "earthed", on the copper, some electrons wiped off the Perspex get back to the Perspex where the copper touches the electrophorus.<br>
 However, the points of contact are few on these two surfaces so the electrons cannot spread all over the Perspex, because it is a non-conductor.<br>
8. Electrophorus lights a Bunsen burner.<br>
 Use electrons trapped on the electrophorus to make a spark and to light the gas in a Bunsen burner.<br>
Bring the copper plate of a charged electrophorus near your knuckle and see if you can detect a spark as the electrons jump across the gap to your body and back to "earth" from where they came.<br>
 The electron flow is from the surplus to the deficiency, that is, a current of electrons flows from negative to positive.<br>
 Charge the plate again by laying it on the charged Perspex, touching the topside with a finger and lifting the plate off.<br>
 This time, turn the gas on a little and nearly touch the Bunsen burner with the copper plate.<br>
 If you can make a long spark, it will light the gas.<br>
 Electrons running from a charged copper plate can momentarily light up a fluorescent tube.<br>
 The electron flow is from the surplus to the deficiency, i.e. a current of electrons flows from negative too positive.<br>
9. Electrophorus lights electric lamp.<br>
 Charge the copper disc of the electrophorus.<br>
 Hold the end of the lamp in one hand and touch the terminal of the other end with the copper disc.<br>
 You may need to darken the room slightly to be able to notice the flash.<br>
 To measure the amount of charge stored on an electrophorus, repeat the experiment.<br>
 How many times you can cause the lamp to flash without recharging the plastic plate?<br>
 If the original charge on the plastic does not leak away, the lamp can be flashed many times.<br>
10. Many charges from one source.<br>
 Use a flat bottom aluminium foil pie dish.<br>
 Push a drawing pin up through the centre of the pie dish.<br>
 Press a rubber eraser down onto the upturned point of the drawing pin.<br>
 Rub the bottom of a flat polystyrene dish with wool.<br>
 Hold onto the end of the eraser and use it as a handle to lift up the pie dish then place it in the polystyrene bowl.<br>
 The head of the drawing pin now connects the aluminium pie dish with the polystyrene bowl.<br>
 Touch the aluminium pie dish with your finger then lift it up using the rubber eraser handle.<br>
 Touch the aluminium pie dish again.<br>
 A spark may jump between your finger and the pie dish each time you touch it.<br>
11. Use a piece of aluminium or a cake tin.<br>
 Heat the metal evenly over a flame.<br>
 Touch a wax candle to the centre of the aluminium until it melts and sticks solidly to it as a handle.<br>
 Use a plastic dish pan or bowl larger than the cake tin.<br>
 Put the bowl or pan on a table and stroke the inside bottom of the pan briskly with a piece of fur or flannel for half a minute.<br>
 Put the aluminium on the plastic and press it down hard with your fingers.<br>
 Remove the aluminium pan, put your finger near the metal and see a spark.<br>
 You can take many charges from the plastic without more rubbing.<br>
 Press the metal against the plastic, press with your fingers and lift by the handle.<br>
12. Many charges from one source<br>
<a href="./images/31.1.8.1.gif">See diagram 31.1.8.1</a>: Many charges from one source, electrophorus.<br>

 <a href="./images/31.7.4.3a.gif">See diagram 31.7.4.3a</a>: Droppers.<br>
 Two droppers produce two fine jets of water from the upper container.<br>
 Valves A and B break the two fine jets of water drops before passing through rings C and D.<br>
 The drops fall into containers E and F connected to an adjustable spark gap G.<br>
 A Neon globe can be attached to one of the electrodes of the spark gap so that it flashes every 10 seconds.<br>
 The distance between the spark gap electrodes can be enlarged and an electrostatic voltmeter can be connected into the circuit.<br>
 The voltmeter will read full scale in a short time, because the apparatus can produce voltages &gt; 6000V.<br>
 During operation of the generator the containers E and F do not remain at exactly the same potential.<br>
 If one container, say the container at the right becomes positive, electrical charges on the container will induce opposite charges on the jet.<br>
A negative container induces positive charge on the jet, so positive charged drops break off and fall into the positive container, making it still more positive.<br>
 At the other side the positive container induces negative drops to make the negative container still more negative.<br>
 So charges build up very rapidly.<br>

<a href="./images/31.5.3.gif">See diagram 31.5.3</a>: Gold leaf electroscope.<br>
 The gold leaf electroscope is used for detecting and measuring electric charges.<br>
 It consists of two gold leaves attached to a brass rod in a glass vessel.<br>
 A metal cap is attached to the end of the rod.<br>
When the leaves have charges of the same sign they repel each another like an inverted V and separate more widely if the charge is increased or fall together if the charge is decreased.<br>
 The gold leaves may be charged by induction or by contact.<br>
 Suppose that they are charged negatively.<br>
 The sign of the charge on any charged body may be found by bringing it up to the terminal of the electroscope.<br>
If a positively charged body is held close to the terminal, electrons from the leaves will be attracted up to the terminal by the positive charge, and the charge on the leaves will be decreased and they will fall together.<br>
If a negatively charged body is held close to the terminal, electrons will leave the terminal and go down to the gold leaves to increase their charges and so the leaves will separate more than before.<br>
So if the gold leaves are charged together negatively, they fall together for a positively charged body, and separate for a negatively charged body.<br>
To use a negatively charged body to charge the gold leaf electroscope positively, place the negatively charged body near the terminal so that electrons will flow down to the gold leaves, leaving the terminal positively charged.<br>
When the rod is earthed, grounded by touching with the finger, electrons flow from the leaves to the earth, leaving the leaves neutral.<br>
When the earth connection is broken, and the charging body then removed, the positive charge from the terminal distributes over the terminal and leaves, leaving the electroscope with a net charge of opposite polarity to the charged body.<br>
To use a negatively charged body to charge the gold leaf electroscope negatively, place the negatively charged body on the terminal to make direct contact between the terminal and charged body.<br>
An electroscope used for measuring electric charges may have only one leaf.<br>
The case is metal and is also charged.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="31.3.1H">31.3.1</a> Lightning, lightning conductor, lightning stroke, aircraft<br>
<a href="./images/31.1.5.gif">See diagram 31.1.5</a>: Lightning conductor.<br>
 1. Lightning bolt<br>
 Lightning is a discharge of electrons from a point where there is a surplus of electrons to a point where there are fewer electrons.<br>
Lightning can be discharged from one part of the cloud to another (in-cloud), from cloud to cloud (from negative part of one cloud to positive part of another cloud), from cloud to the atmosphere, from cloud to earth (lightning bolt).<br>
A lighting bolt starts when a forking stream of charge with sharp points goes down from the cloud towards the earth.<br>
Before it reaches the ground an upward stream of positive charge (upward streamer) reaches one of the points and the lightning bolt lights up from the bottom (return stroke).<br>
So a lightning bolt "moves up and down".<br>
Lightning flickers when other sources of charge in the same cloud use the same channel as the first lightning bolt.<br>
A distinctive lightning bolt is sometimes called fork lightning or chain lightning, compared to "sheet lightning", but they are the same, except that sheet lightning is a lightning bolt (forked lightning), hidden by cloud, so you only see the diffused reflection.<br>
2. Electrophorus and lightning<br>
 The electrophorus experiment explains lightning, which is the same effect occurring on a much larger scale.<br>
 In the atmospheric disturbances of a heavy storm, clouds often become strongly charged electrically.<br>
 Just as the copper plate in the electrophorus experiment they might have an excess of electrons produced by the atmospheric disturbances.<br>
 If the charged cloud approaches another cloud that is not so heavily charged giant sparks can jump from one cloud to the other.<br>
 This is a flash of lightning with the accompanying noise of thunder.<br>
3. Lightning rod<br>
Lightning usually strikes tall objects on featureless surfaces, e.g. trees on a golf course.<br>
 However, lightning can strike water, e.g. swimming pools, where the electrical charge remains on the surface and spreads out in all directions.<br>
 If the cloud is low, electrons may jump between the cloud and a building on the ground.<br>
 The building is struck by lightning.<br>
 Tall buildings usually have a long metal lightning rod running from the ground vertically up the side of the building and extending higher than the building.<br>
 The long metal rod, lightning conductor, protects the building from being struck by lightning.<br>
The lightning rod has a sharply pointed tip so that an intense electric field forms at the tip during an electrical storm and electric charge flows into the atmosphere preventing a strike on the building by a bolt of lightning.<br>
 If a lightning strike does occur, it is conducted to the earth through the lightning rod.<br>
 If electrons jump from a charged cloud overhead to the building, they can pass through the conducting rod to earth leaving the building free from damage.<br>
 Lightning conductors end in trident points, because points discharge electrons from the earth into the clouds easier than any other shape.<br>
 Lightning conductors may also have a metal ball to help electrons to land on in case of discharge is from cloud to earth.<br>
4. Lightning safety<br>
It is not true that lightning does not strike twice in the same place, so do not try to run away from it if you are caught in a thunderstorm.<br>
 If lightning hits a tree nearby, electricity may flow into a runner, because the body conducts the electricity better than the ground.<br>
 Avoid lightning by sitting with feet together in a depression in the ground.<br>
 Individual trees can be protected from lightning in exposed places, e.g. golf courses, by an LPS system, lightning protection for trees, where the trees receive individual lightning conductors.<br>
 The "30: 30 safety rule" is if you hear thunder within 30 seconds of lightning, take shelter for 30 minutes.<br>
5. Aircraft and lightning<br>
 An aircraft may become charged electrically in flight due to friction with the air.<br>
 Most of the charge is removed while the plane is in flight with graphite coated nylon rods fitted with tungsten points placed at the extremities of the aircraft and linked by metal strips.<br>
On landing, the plane is completely discharged by a wire spring coil fitted between the wheels that strikes the ground to allow electrons either to flow on to, or away from, the aircraft.<br>
 Otherwise passengers would risk an electric shock when alighting and a fire when refuelling caused by a spark due to discharge.<br>
6. Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790)<br>
He showed that lightning is a discharge of static electricity in 1752 by raising a kite and attaching a key to the end of the string.<br>
 A dangerous experiment!<br>
 A spark jumped from the key to his hand, because electricity was conducted along the wet string.<br>
 Some people who imitated this dangerous experiment were killed by the lightning.<br>
7. Trees and lightning<br>
Examine the lightning strike of trees.<br>
 Some trees with rough bark, e.g. oak, are more likely to be struck, because of water in the bark.<br>
 Other smooth bark species, e.g. beech, are less likely to be struck.<br>

 Lift the candle holder from the balloon by holding on to the candle.<br>
Touch the bottom edge of the candle holder with a fingertip.<br>
 Observe a small spark jumping to your finger.<br>

 Voltage is produced by rubbing two materials together.<br>
 The least used of the six methods is friction.<br>
 Its main application is in van de Graaff generators, used by some laboratories to produce high voltages.<br>
 Friction electricity (static electricity) is usually a nuisance.<br>
 For example, a flying aircraft may accumulate electric charges from the friction between its skin and the passing air.<br>
 These charges may interfere with radio communication.<br>
