 <a href="../images/31.5.14.gif">See diagram 31 5 14</a>: Induction coil.<br>
 (H. D. Ruhmkorff, 1803- 1877, Germany, France)<br>
 1. An induction coil (spark coil, Ruhmkorff induction coil) is a kind of transformer where low voltage direct current in a primary coil is
 interrupted to induce higher voltage in the secondary coil.<br>
The induction coil contains a primary circuit (a few turns of thick wire), a switch, a rheostat (variable resistance), a battery, a make-and-break
 (interrupter), and a condenser in parallel with the make-and- break.<br>
 The secondary circuit is many turns of thin wire wound on the primary coil, with a spark gap.<br>
 The greatest distance between the spheres of the spark gap is a measure of the induced emf.<br>
 An iron core usually consists of a bunch of insulated iron wires, which can be placed within the primary coil.<br>
 Changing magnetic field created by the primary circuit can induce a changing voltage and/or current in the secondary circuit.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="31.1.2H">31.1.2</a> Rhumkorff coil<br>
 IEC Ruhmkorff induction coil, tungsten vibrating points, high quality capacitor reduces arcing, fuse fitted to protect primary winding,
 secondary winding contains thousands of turns and can be slide from the primary winding to reduce coupling, runs on 6 to 9 volts, spark length 25 - 30 cm, 
 removable and adjustable needle points with insulated handles, 300 mm, 125 mm, 110 mm.<br>
 High voltage induction coil with a removable secondary winding.<br>
 The fused primary is wound on a laminated electrical-steel coil, it requires 6 to 9V DC, input is via 4 mm banana plugs.<br>
 The vibrating contacts are easily adjusted and are made of tungsten.<br>
 The coil produces a 25 mm spark between adjustable needle points, which plug into 4 mm sockets, removing the points allows the high voltage to
 be fed to other equipment.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="31.1.3H">31.1.3</a> Mutual inductance<br>
 Mutual inductance of two circuits refers to the size of the voltage in the secondary circuit induced by changes in the current of the primary circuit.<br>
 The unit of mutual inductance is the henry, H.<br>
 Mutual inductance for two adjacent circuits is the emf induced in one circuit caused by the unit rate of change in the current flowing though the other circuit.<br>
 In the induction coil, the induced emf is proportional to the number of turns per unit length of the primary circuit to the number of turns in the secondary circuit, and is proportional to the time rate of change of current in the primary circuit.<br>
 When an iron core is placed inside the primary coil the currents magnetizes the iron to increase the induced emf in the secondary coil.<br>
 The back emf can flow across the gap in the make and break causing a spark.<br>
 However, instead this current can charge a condenser in parallel with the make and break.<br>
 The charged condenser immediately discharges to send current through the primary circuit in a direction opposite to the original current.<br>
 When the change in magnetic flux from the primary coil is experienced by the secondary coil, an emf is induced in the secondary coil.<br>
 The emf = M × (change in primary coil current / change in time), or M × (time rate of change in the primary current), where M = the mutual inductance of that 2 coil system.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="31.1.4H">31.1.4</a> Self-inductance<br>
 <a href="../images/31.5.15.gif">See diagram 31.5.15</a>: Self-inductance.<br>
 Self-inductance refers to a circuit creating changing magnetic flux through itself, which can induce an opposing voltage in itself.<br>
 The unit of self-inductance is the henry.<br>
 When current is started or stopped in a conductor, an induced emf occurs in that conductor, self-induction, with direction such as to oppose the change (Lenz's law).<br>
 So when the current starts to flow, the self-induced emf opposes the rise in current, back emf.<br>
 When the current is broken, the back emf tends to cause the current to keep flowing to cause the current to falls gradually to zero instead of falling instantly.<br>
 The unit of self-inductance, the henry, is the self-inductance of a circuit in which the back emf is 1 volt when the current alters at the rate of 1 ampere per second.<br>
 When AC passes through a coil, the changing magnetic flux induces a back emf in the coil, which opposes the changing current.<br>
 Self-inductance of the coil is measured in henry, L.<br>
 The current lags behind the emf by a quarter of a cycle, 90<sup>o</sup>.<br>
 Self-inductance, inductance, occurs when a coil with a changing current induces an emf, in itself.<br>
 So = L ( I / t) henry (H), where 1 H = 1 V.s / A.<br>
 Coils are turns of insulated copper wire to increase inductance depending on how many turns, distance between turns, diameter of the oil, and what they are wound on.<br>
 For inductance, self inductance, L, in an AC circuit, when the AC passes through the coil the changing magnetic flux induces a "back emf " in the coil that opposes the changing current.<br>
 While magnetic flux is changing inside a coil, a back emf is induced, which opposes the changing current.<br>
 emf = L × (change in current / change in time) = L × (rate of change of current), where L = self-inductance constant of the coil.<br>
 The unit of self-inductance is the henry, H.<br>
 One 1 henry, H, = emf of 1 volt induced in a circuit by electric current change of 1 ampere per second.<br>
 Self-inductance occurs when AC passes through a coil, because, if the current in a coil changes, the magnetic flux through the coil caused by the current also changes, so the changing current induces an emf in the same coil.<br>
 The current lags behind the emf by a quarter of a cycle (90<sup>o</sup>).<br>
 Back emf, E = -L I / t, where I / t is the rate of change of the current, and L is the self inductance of the coil measured in henry, H.<br>

 Wimshurst machine induction generator<br>
 <a href="../images/31.6.1.jpg">See diagram 31.6.1</a>: Wimshurst machine.<br>
 "Two parallel plates rotate in opposite directions.<br>
 Charge due to friction in collected by combs then stored in two integrated high voltage capacitors, Leyden jars, connected in parallel to an adjustable spark gap up to 30 mm.<br>
 The Wimshurst electrostatic generator consists of a system of electrophorus plates that operate in a continuous fashion to accumulate large amounts of positive and negative charge.<br>
 If positive charge on a disk on one plate A an opposite negative charge is induced on the nearest metal disk on the contra-rotating second plate B.<br>
 The connecting rods transfer an induced positive charge to disks on a diametrically opposite position of Plate A.<br>
 As the plates rotate the second plate B moves to a position where it induces a positive charge on the disk opposite it on plate A via the second set of connecting rods.<br>
 With continuous rotation positive charges accumulate at position A and negative charges at B.<br>
 Experiment<br>
 Attach a 3 m long wood bar at one end to one terminal of a static machine, with the other end grounded or insulated, then attach electroscopes along 
 the bar to show flow of charge and potential drop.<br>
 Attach two ends of a dry stick to a static machine then measure with an electrostatic voltmeter and micro-ammeter.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="31.1.6H">31.1.6</a> Electrophorus<br>
 <a href="../images/31.1.8.1.gif">See diagram 31.1.8.1</a>: Electrophorus.<br>
 <a href="../images/31.147.gif">See diagram 31.147</a>: Many charges from one source.<br>
 An electrophorus is used to repeatedly generate static electricity by induction.<br>
 Discharge of an electrophorus shows the actual movement of charge.<br>
 Alessandro Giuseppe Antonio Anastasio Volta (1745 - 1827), was the Italian experimenter who invented the "electroforo perpetuo", electrophorus,
 described in 1775.<br>
 Luigi Galvani (1737 - 1798), another Italian experimenter did the first work on the twitching of frogs' legs by electric current.<br>
 Volta took up the study of frogs' legs and showed Galvani that he was wrong about "animal electricity".<br>
 Experiments<br>
 1. The electrophorus has a flat metal disc A, with an insulating handle H, and a flat ebonite disc B, on an earthed metal sole S.<br>
 Rub plate B is rubbed with cats fur so that it acquires a negative charge.<br>
 Place disc A on disc B.<br>
 Neither A nor B are perfectly flat so contact between the discs is only at a few points.<br>
 So surfaces of the discs are mainly separated by a thin layer of air.<br>
 Disc A has charges induced on it.<br>
 Earth disc A by touching while it is still resting on B.<br>
 Electrons flow from disc A it to earth leaving a net positive charge on disc A.<br>
 This net charge can be used as a source of charge so the above procedure can be repeated many times to build up charge on B,
 because in each charging cycle no charge is removed from B.<br>
 The electrophorus works better if first dried in front of a radiator.<br>
 2. The electrophorus consists of a flat metal disc with an insulated glass handle, a flat dielectric disc, e.g. ebonite, on an earthed metal sole.<br>
 If the flat dielectric disc is rubbed with silk it becomes positively charged by friction.<br>
 When the flat metal disc is placed near or on the dielectric disc the lower surface of the metal disc become negatively charged by induction
 and so the upper surface of the metal disc becomes positively charged.<br>
 The upper surface of the metal disc is lightly touched with a finger to earth it and neutralize the positive charges.<br>
 Electrons cannot flow from the dielectric disc to the metal disk, because the dielectric disk is an insulator.<br>
 The metal disc now has a negative charge and can be lifted away with the insulated handle.<br>
 The two discs are not perfectly flat so these two discs touch at only a few places leaving a thin layer of air between them.<br>
 So the charging is mainly by induction and not by contact.<br>
 The procedure can be repeated many times to build up charge on the metal disc, because no charge has been removed from the dielectric disc.<br>
 More work is required to lift the charged metal disc than if it were uncharged, because a force of attraction occurs between the charged metal disc
 and the oppositely charged dielectric disk.<br>
 A spark occurs between a finger and the disc and this can occur again after the disc is recharged.<br>
 The energy required comes from the person who lifts the disc, because more energy is needed the lift the charged disc than an uncharged disc,
 because of the force of attraction between the charged disc and the uncharged ebonite dielectric.<br>
 3. Finger electrophorus shows electric field.<br>
 Charge an electrophorus then trace a circle on it with your finger and probe the resulting field with a pith ball on a long thread.<br>
 4. Use a neon discharge tube to show a flash by holding one end on the electrophorus and then touching the other end.<br>
 5. Suspend an electrophorus by raising it off the plate with an attached helical spring.<br>
 Touch the disc to remove induced charge and see the spring lengthen.<br>
 6. You can use a plastic gramophone record to make an electrophorus, but it slips about in use.<br>
 Also, some records contain materials that do not take the same charge consistently.<br>
 You can use a block of sulfur as an electrophorus. but handling it is difficult, because it tends to crumble.<br>
 Brass, copper and aluminium work as well as a copper plate.<br>
 Use short Perspex handles for convenience in storage with no metal screws protruding through the Perspex.<br>
 It will nor work without a nearly perfect insulator for a handle.<br>
 Nylon clothes may crackle when pulled over the head in dry weather, because nylon on is an insulator.<br>
 Friction with dry hair or even dry clothing electrifies the clothing.<br>
 In dry weather, the charges accumulate and, when earthed, cause noisy little sparks.<br>
 If the weather is humid, the charges generated can be conducted off the Perspex, through water vapour, on to the table and on to earth.<br>
 In damp weather dry the electrophorus with a radiator before use.<br>
 7. Rub a sheet of Perspex, or slab of solidified sulfur or a plastic gramophone record, with fur.<br>
 The rubbing action wipes loose surface electrons off the Perspex onto the fur, so the Perspex becomes positively charged.<br>
 Hold a flat sheet of copper by an insulated handle on the charged Perspex.<br>
 The copper sheet and Perspex touch at only a few points although both seem flat.<br>
 The copper conductor has electrons that can move from atom to atom, unlike an insulator.<br>
 Positive charges from excess protons in the Perspex attract electrons from the flat sheet of copper when it comes into the electric field of the charged Perspex.<br>
 Unlike charges attract, so the underside of the copper disc becomes negatively charged, because it has extra electrons attracted to it, leaving the upper side with fewer electrons.<br>
 Touch the top of the sheet of copper with the finger.<br>
 The human body is damp and an electrical conductor, so when you touch the copper plate, electrons flow through your body to the top of the sheet of copper.<br>
 These electrons replace the electrons lost when the electrons in the sheet of copper flowed down to the Perspex.<br>
 When you remove your finger from the copper, these replacement electrons are left on the copper plate.<br>
 The electrons lost from your body are replaced by electrons moving up your body from the earth, if you are not wearing insulating rubber-soled shoes.<br>
 When you lift the copper plate, the extra electrons are trapped on it.<br>
 You can produce a spark between the charged copper plate and your knuckle or the metal burner, because so many excess electrons are repelling each other on the charged plate that they can be "pushed off" the plate.<br>
 If you touch the plate with one end of a conducting copper wire, and touch the other end to your finger or to the burner, these excess electrons quickly flow through the wire and form an electric current.<br>
 An electric current through a wire is simply a movement of and electrons.<br>
 When all the excess electrons have flowed from the plate through the wire, the current will stop.<br>
 When the charged plate is surrounded by dry air there is no conductor through which the excess electrons can flow to earth.<br>
 When the plate is brought close to a conducting object such as the metal of the burner, the excess electrons on the plate first repel any free or conduction electrons in the burner as far as possible away from that part of the metal closest to the charged plate.<br>
 This part of the metal then becomes positively charged.<br>
 Electrons now on the plate try to push each other and are attracted to the positive part of the metal burner.<br>
 Some electrons leap from the charged plate through the air to the burner, knocking electrons out of air molecules and these join in the electric current passing from plate to burner, producing a quick spark and a sharp cracking noise.<br>
 In a charged electrophorus, charge leaks away due to conduction of electrons by moisture on the surface of the apparatus.<br>
 The original energy comes from you, because work is done in lifting the plate off against the attraction caused by the electric field.<br>
 Pulling the charged copper disc away from the oppositely charged Perspex sheet takes energy from you.<br>
 When you put your finger, which is "earthed", on the copper, some electrons wiped off the Perspex get back to the Perspex where the copper touches the electrophorus.<br>
 However, the points of contact are few on these two surfaces so the electrons cannot spread all over the Perspex, because it is a non-conductor.<br>
 8. Electrophorus lights a Bunsen burner.<br>
 Use electrons trapped on the electrophorus to make a spark and to light the gas in a Bunsen burner.<br>
 Bring the copper plate of a charged electrophorus near your knuckle and see if you can detect a spark as the electrons jump across the gap to your body and back to "earth" from where they came.<br>
 The electron flow is from the surplus to the deficiency, that is, a current of electrons flows from negative to positive.<br>
 Charge the plate again by laying it on the charged Perspex, touching the topside with a finger and lifting the plate off.<br>
 This time, turn the gas on a little and nearly touch the Bunsen burner with the copper plate.<br>
 If you can make a long spark, it will light the gas.<br>
 Electrons running from a charged copper plate can momentarily light up a fluorescent tube.<br>
 The electron flow is from the surplus to the deficiency, i.e. a current of electrons flows from negative too positive.<br>
 9. Electrophorus lights electric lamp.<br>
 Charge the copper disc of the electrophorus.<br>
 Hold the end of the lamp in one hand and touch the terminal of the other end with the copper disc.<br>
 You may need to darken the room slightly to be able to notice the flash.<br>
 To measure the amount of charge stored on an electrophorus, repeat the experiment.<br>
 How many times you can cause the lamp to flash without recharging the plastic plate?<br>
 If the original charge on the plastic does not leak away, the lamp can be flashed many times.<br>
 10. Many charges from one source.<br>
 Use a flat bottom aluminium foil pie dish.<br>
 Push a drawing pin up through the centre of the pie dish.<br>
 Press a rubber eraser down onto the upturned point of the drawing pin.<br>
 Rub the bottom of a flat polystyrene dish with wool.<br>
 Hold onto the end of the eraser and use it as a handle to lift up the pie dish then place it in the polystyrene bowl.<br>
 The head of the drawing pin now connects the aluminium pie dish with the polystyrene bowl.<br>
 Touch the aluminium pie dish with your finger then lift it up using the rubber eraser handle.<br>
 Touch the aluminium pie dish again.<br>
 A spark may jump between your finger and the pie dish each time you touch it.<br>
 11. Use a piece of aluminium or a cake tin.<br>
 Heat the metal evenly over a flame.<br>
 Touch a wax candle to the centre of the aluminium until it melts and sticks solidly to it as a handle.<br>
 Use a plastic dish pan or bowl larger than the cake tin.<br>
 Put the bowl or pan on a table and stroke the inside bottom of the pan briskly with a piece of fur or flannel for half a minute.<br>
 Put the aluminium on the plastic and press it down hard with your fingers.<br>
 Remove the aluminium pan, put your finger near the metal and see a spark.<br>
 You can take many charges from the plastic without more rubbing.<br>
 Press the metal against the plastic, press with your fingers and lift by the handle.<br>
 12. Many charges from one source<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="31.1.7H">31.1.7</a> Induction Kit<br>
 Two movable coils with a removable iron core, the primary inner core has 450 turns of heavy wire, it sits within a secondary coil of 1300 turns of fine wire.<br>
 Ideal for magnetic field and induction experiments to demonstrate that an induced potential is produced either by:<br>

 <a href="../images/31.7.4.3a.gif">See diagram 31.7.4.3a</a>: Droppers.<br>
 Two droppers produce two fine jets of water from the upper container.<br>
 Valves A and B break the two fine jets of water drops before passing through rings C and D.<br>
 The drops fall into containers E and F connected to an adjustable spark gap G.<br>
 A Neon globe can be attached to one of the electrodes of the spark gap so that it flashes every 10 seconds.<br>
 The distance between the spark gap electrodes can be enlarged and an electrostatic voltmeter can be connected into the circuit.<br>
 The voltmeter will read full scale in a short time, because the apparatus can produce voltages &gt; 6000V.<br>
 During operation of the generator the containers E and F do not remain at exactly the same potential.<br>
 If one container, say the container at the right becomes positive, electrical charges on the container will induce opposite charges on the jet.<br>
 A negative container induces positive charge on the jet, so positive charged drops break off and fall into the positive container, making it still more positive.<br>
 At the other side the positive container induces negative drops to make the negative container still more negative.<br>
 So charges build up very rapidly.<br>

 <a href="../images/31.5.3.gif">See diagram 31.5.3</a>: Gold leaf electroscope.<br>
 The gold leaf electroscope is used for detecting and measuring electric charges.<br>
 It consists of two gold leaves attached to a brass rod in a glass vessel.<br>
 A metal cap is attached to the end of the rod.<br>
 When the leaves have charges of the same sign they repel each another like an inverted V and separate more widely if the charge is increased or fall together if the charge is decreased.<br>
 The gold leaves may be charged by induction or by contact.<br>
 Suppose that they are charged negatively.<br>
 The sign of the charge on any charged body may be found by bringing it up to the terminal of the electroscope.<br>
 If a positively charged body is held close to the terminal, electrons from the leaves will be attracted up to the terminal by the positive charge, and the charge on the leaves will be decreased and they will fall together.<br>
 If a negatively charged body is held close to the terminal, electrons will leave the terminal and go down to the gold leaves to increase their charges and so the leaves will separate more than before.<br>
 So if the gold leaves are charged together negatively, they fall together for a positively charged body, and separate for a negatively charged body.<br>
 To use a negatively charged body to charge the gold leaf electroscope positively, place the negatively charged body near the terminal so that electrons will flow down to the gold leaves, leaving the terminal positively charged.<br>
 When the rod is earthed, grounded by touching with the finger, electrons flow from the leaves to the earth, leaving the leaves neutral.<br>
 When the earth connection is broken, and the charging body then removed, the positive charge from the terminal distributes over the terminal and leaves, leaving the electroscope with a net charge of opposite polarity to the charged body.<br>
 To use a negatively charged body to charge the gold leaf electroscope negatively, place the negatively charged body on the terminal to make direct contact between the terminal and charged body.<br>
 An electroscope used for measuring electric charges may have only one leaf.<br>
 The case is metal and is also charged.<br>
 The movement of the leaf indicating the magnitude of the charge or potential measured.<br>

 <a href="../images/31.1.5.gif">See diagram 31.1.5</a>: Lightning conductor.<br>
 1. Lightning bolt<br>
 Lightning is a discharge of electrons from a point where there is a surplus of electrons to a point where there are fewer electrons.<br>
 Lightning can be discharged from one part of the cloud to another (in-cloud), from cloud to cloud (from negative part of one cloud to positive part of another cloud), from cloud to the atmosphere, from cloud to earth (lightning bolt).<br>
 A lighting bolt starts when a forking stream of charge with sharp points goes down from the cloud towards the earth.<br>
 Before it reaches the ground an upward stream of positive charge (upward streamer) reaches one of the points and the lightning bolt lights up from the bottom (return stroke).<br>
 So a lightning bolt "moves up and down".<br>
 Lightning flickers when other sources of charge in the same cloud use the same channel as the first lightning bolt.<br>
 A distinctive lightning bolt is sometimes called fork lightning or chain lightning, compared to "sheet lightning", but they are the same, except that sheet lightning is a lightning bolt (forked lightning), hidden by cloud, so you only see the diffused reflection.<br>
 2. Electrophorus and lightning<br>
 The electrophorus experiment explains lightning, which is the same effect occurring on a much larger scale.<br>
 In the atmospheric disturbances of a heavy storm, clouds often become strongly charged electrically.<br>
 Just as the copper plate in the electrophorus experiment they might have an excess of electrons produced by the atmospheric disturbances.<br>
 If the charged cloud approaches another cloud that is not so heavily charged giant sparks can jump from one cloud to the other.<br>
 This is a flash of lightning with the accompanying noise of thunder.<br>
 3. Lightning rod<br>
 Lightning usually strikes tall objects on featureless surfaces, e.g. trees on a golf course.<br>
 However, lightning can strike water, e.g. swimming pools, where the electrical charge remains on the surface and spreads out in all directions.<br>
 If the cloud is low, electrons may jump between the cloud and a building on the ground.<br>
 The building is struck by lightning.<br>
 Tall buildings usually have a long metal lightning rod running from the ground vertically up the side of the building and extending higher than the building.<br>
 The long metal rod, lightning conductor, protects the building from being struck by lightning.<br>
 The lightning rod has a sharply pointed tip so that an intense electric field forms at the tip during an electrical storm and electric charge flows into the atmosphere preventing a strike on the building by a bolt of lightning.<br>
 If a lightning strike does occur, it is conducted to the earth through the lightning rod.<br>
 If electrons jump from a charged cloud overhead to the building, they can pass through the conducting rod to earth leaving the building free from damage.<br>
 Lightning conductors end in trident points, because points discharge electrons from the earth into the clouds easier than any other shape.<br>
 Lightning conductors may also have a metal ball to help electrons to land on in case of discharge is from cloud to earth.<br>
 4. Lightning safety<br>
 It is not true that lightning does not strike twice in the same place, so do not try to run away from it if you are caught in a thunderstorm.<br>
 If lightning hits a tree nearby, electricity may flow into a runner, because the body conducts the electricity better than the ground.<br>
 Avoid lightning by sitting with feet together in a depression in the ground.<br>
 Individual trees can be protected from lightning in exposed places, e.g. golf courses, by an LPS system, lightning protection for trees, where the trees receive individual lightning conductors.<br>
 The "30: 30 safety rule" is if you hear thunder within 30 seconds of lightning, take shelter for 30 minutes.<br>
 5. Aircraft and lightning<br>
 An aircraft may become charged electrically in flight due to friction with the air.<br>
 Most of the charge is removed while the plane is in flight with graphite coated nylon rods fitted with tungsten points placed at the extremities of the aircraft and linked by metal strips.<br>
 On landing, the plane is completely discharged by a wire spring coil fitted between the wheels that strikes the ground to allow electrons either to flow on to, or away from, the aircraft.<br>
 Otherwise passengers would risk an electric shock when alighting and a fire when refuelling caused by a spark due to discharge.<br>
 6. Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790)<br>
 He showed that lightning is a discharge of static electricity in 1752 by raising a kite and attaching a key to the end of the string.<br>
 A dangerous experiment!<br>
 A spark jumped from the key to his hand, because electricity was conducted along the wet string.<br>
 Some people who imitated this dangerous experiment were killed by the lightning.<br>
 7. Trees and lightning<br>
 Examine the lightning strike of trees.<br>
 Some trees with rough bark, e.g. oak, are more likely to be struck, because of water in the bark.<br>
 Other smooth bark species, e.g. beech, are less likely to be struck.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2">1. Capacitors<br>
Capacitors store electric charge.<br>
Capacitors contain two parallel electrical conductives, plates, separated by an insulating layer, the dielectric.<br>
Capacitors store electrical energy in the form of an electric field, to be released later.<br>
A capacitor stores energy by separating charge.<br>
A potential difference occurs when charge is placed in a capacitor.<br>
Capacitors were formerly called "condensers".<br>
2. Capacitance<br>
Capacitance, C, is the ability of the capacitor to store charge, Q, source of emf, e.g. a battery, will move charge from one plate to the other until the voltage produced by the charge build-up will equal the battery voltage.<br>
Capacitance is measured in farads, F.<br>
Capacitance is the ratio of the total amount of charge stored on the parallel plates / potential difference between the plates (voltage applied to the plates), C = Q / V.<br>
Capacitance, C = Q coulombs / V volts, measured in farads, F.<br>
So 1 farad, F = 1 CV-1.<br>
(Michael Faraday, England, 1791-1867)<br>
<a name="faradH">The farad<br>
A farad, F, is the SI derived unit of capacitance as the charge in coulombs a capacitor accepts for the potential across it to change by 1 volt.<br>
1 farad is the capacitance, which stores a charge of 1 coulomb across a potential difference of 1 volt.<br>
The farad, F, is the SI derived unit of electrical capacitance, the ability of a body to store an electrical charge.<br>
One farad has a very large capacitance, so the smaller units used are the microfarad, µF, and the picofarad pF.<br>
1 mF, 1 millifarad, one thousandth, 10-3, of a farad = 0.001 F.<br>
1 μF, 1 microfarad, one millionth, 10-6, of a farad = 0.000 001 F, (1 F = 1000000 µF).<br>
1 nF 1 nanofarad, one billionth, 10-9, of a farad.<br>
1 pF 1 picofarad, one trillionth, 10−12, of a farad.<br>
Note: Capacitance, C, is measured in farads, F, but charge, Q, is measured in coulombs, C.<br>
Capacitance = εA / d, where ε= permittivity of material between the plates, A = overlapping area of the plates, d = distance between plates.<br>
Capacitors in parallel C = C1 + C2 + C3.<br>
Capacitors in series C = 1 / C1 + 1 / C2 + 1 / C3.<br>
3. Energy of a capacitor<br>
The work done, W, equals the shaded area under the graph of potential difference between the plates, V, and charge of the plates, Q.<br>
So W= QV.<br>
V is actually the average potential difference the charge moves through.<br>
If V = maximum potential difference, the average potential difference = V /2.<br>
So energy stored, W = W X V, Q = CV, so energy stored in a capacitor charge Q and potential difference V = 
QV = (Q2 / C) = CV2 joule, j.<br>
Experiment<br>
1. When you switch off the power to your computer, the indicator lights keep glowing for a while, because electrical energy has been stored in capacitors.<br>
2. Show that the capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor is inversely proportional to the distance of separation.<br>
Cover the plates of the capacitor with shellac so that they may contact without shorting.<br>
When 9V is applied momentarily to the capacitor, no deflection is noted on the electroscope.<br>
After separating the plates, the electroscope leaves diverge showing that the voltage has increased and the capacitance has decreased.<br>
For a small deflection of the electroscope, about 1000 volts is needed.<br>
C = Q / V, C= A / d.<br>

<a href="../images/30.5.1.5.gif">See diagram 30.5.1.5</a>: Time variation of power for a capacitor.<br>
1. The current in a capacitor in an AC circuit depends on the frequency and is out of phase with the voltage.<br>
The voltage across a capacitor lags the current by 90o.<br>
2. A capacitor stops DC after allowing a brief flow of current that charges it, but lets AC pass though it as the capacitor is charged then discharged in one direction, then charged then discharged in the opposite direction, 50 times per second.<br>
So no current actually passes through a capacitor, because its plates are separated by an insulator.<br>
However, current <b>seems</b> to pass through as the electrons move on and off the plates very rapidly.<br>
So an AC ammeter does register the "passing" of current and the larger the capacitor the greater the current "passed".<br>
3. If a generator, frequency ω, supplies an RMS voltage to a capacitor, capacitance C, RMS current, IRMS, = ωCVRMS.<br>
Experiment<br>
4. Connect a 1000 μF in series with a 20 W globe to a 9 Volt AC source, and observe the brightness of the globe.<br>
If the 1000 μF capacitor is replaced by a 470 μF capacitor, the globe is less bright.<br>
If the 9 Volt AC source is replace by a 9 Volt DC source, the globe will not light.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="31.8.2.1H">31.8.2.1</a> Capacitive reactance<br>
1. Capacitive reactance Xc is the ratio of the voltage to the current in a capacitor.<br>
The equivalent of Ohm's law for a capacitor is Vc = IXc, where Xc is the capacitive reactance in ohm, Vc is the capacitive voltage, and I is the effective current.<br>
So capacitive reactance, Xc = 1 / 2πfC, where f is the frequency of the AC in hertz and C is the capacitance in farad.<br>
However, there is a difference in phase.<br>
The current reaches a maximum, the capacitor has maximum charge, when the current has just finished flowing forwards and is about to start flowing backwards.<br>
So the voltage across the capacitor is 90o, one quarter cycle, behind the current.<br>
So reactance is the ratio of voltage to current when they differ in phase by 90o and resistance is the same ratio when voltage and current are in phase.<br>
2. Also, I RMS = VRMS / Xc, where Xc is called the "capacitive reactance".<br>
It is the "resistance of the capacitor".<br>
So Xc = 1 / ωC, ohm.<br>
3. The capacitive reactance of a 20-F capacitor in a 50 Hz circuit = Xc = 1 / ωC = 1 / (2 π x 50 x 20 x 10-6) = 159 ohm.<br>
4. Capacitive reactance is frequency dependent.<br>
<a href="../images/30.5.2.01c.gif">See diagram 30.5.2.0c</a>. The ratio of voltage to current in a capacitor decreases with frequency.<br>
Unlike resistance, capacitive reactance depends on frequency of the AC generator.<br>
Reactance is frequency dependent.<br>
When frequency is reduced, the reactance increases and the current decreases.<br>
A capacitor in an AC circuit consumes no energy.<br>
For a capacitor, the ratio of voltage to current decreases with frequency.<br>
When the frequency is halved, but the current amplitude is kept constant, the capacitor has twice as long to charge up, so it generates twice the potential difference.<br>
The lower frequency causes a larger charge, and so a larger Vc.<br>
Capacitor (condenser), capacitance in an AC circuit<br>
Capacitance and energy<br>
A capacitor stores energy in the form of an electric field between its oppositely charged plates.<br>
So lines of force of an electric field exist between the plates of a capacitor.<br>
The greater the attractive force between the charges on the opposite plates of a capacitor, the more energy is stored.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="31.8.2.2H">31.8.22</a>Coulomb's law<br>
Coulomb's law states that the force between two charged objects is proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of their separation.<br>
<a href="../images/31.8.2.2.png">See diagram 31.8.2.2</a> Capacitance and energy.<br>
* The capacitor in circuit (ii) has double the area of the capacitor in circuit (i), so double the capacitance.<br>
* The capacitor in circuit (iii) has half the separation of the capacitor in circuit (ii), so double the capacitance.<br>
* The identical metal plates in circuit (iv) are connected to the same battery.
The charge on the plates separated by an insulator is greater than if separated by air.<br>
Dielectrics concentrate the lines of force of the electric field between the plates and so increase the capacity for storage of energy.<br>
<br>
Capacitors are polarized or unpolarized.<br>
Unpolarized capacitors, for less than 1 F, and may be connected with either polarity.<br>
They have high voltage ratings of 50 volts to 250 volts.<br>
They have different types of labels, e.g. 0.1 = 0.1 F = 100 nF, 4 n7 = 4.7 nF.<br>
Very small capacitors have a number code:<br>
First number is 1st digit of the value.<br>
Second number is 2nd digit of the value.<br>
Third number is the number of zeros to give capacitance in pF, e.g. 102 = 1000 pF = 1 nF, 472 J = 4700 pF = 4.7 nF, J = 5% tolerance.<br>
<br>
Capacitors are used in filter circuits, because they pass AC (changing) signals, but they block DC (constant) signals.<br>
The time constant measures the time for a capacitor to charge or discharge with a certain resistor.<br>
So capacitors are used with resistors in timing circuits, because it takes a known time for a capacitor to fill with charge.<br>
<br>
(Comment: The usual range of capacitors nowadays is 0.47 F (microfarads) to 47 mF (millifarads).<br>
Capacitors for more than 1F are not manufactured, except to special order.<br>
0.5 F and 0.68 F capacitors are found in some computer motherboards instead of the battery that was used to keep the CMOS-based BIOS memory alive.<br>
These capacitors are also used in some modern portable radio, TV tuner memories and high powered audio amplifiers in sporty motor vehicles.<br>

<a href="../images/30.5.2.5.gif">See diagram 30.5.2.5</a> Time variation of voltage and current for a capacitor.<br>
The voltage on a capacitor depends on the amount of charge stored on its plates.<br>
The current flowing onto the positive capacitor plate, and the equal current flowing off the negative plate, is the rate at which charge is being stored.<br>
In Diagram 30.5.2.3, the current and the voltage are out of phase.<br>
Vc = q / C.<br>
V = Xc Im sin (ωt -π2).<br>

When charge builds upon a capacitor, a voltage develops across the capacitor, which opposes the charging current.<br>
Voltage across the capacitor V = Q / C, where Q is the amount of charge in coulomb, and C is the capacitance in farad.<br>
The current leads the voltage by a quarter of a cycle, i.e. 90o.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="31.8.2.4H">31.8.2.4</a> Capacitors in series and parallel<br>
The combined capacitance, C, of capacitors in series is less than the smallest capacitor, C1 or C2 or C3.<br>
1 / C = 1 / C1 + 1 / C2 + 1 / C3.<br>
The combined capacitance, C, of capacitors in parallel is as if all the capacitors together behave as one big capacitor.<br>
C = C1 + C2 + C3.<br>

<a href="../images/30.5.1.4.gif">See diagram 30.5.1.4</a>: Alternating current voltage.<br>
Instantaneous power for any circuit, P = IV.<br>
Diagram 30.5.2.5 shows power that changes with time.<br>
The power is negative when the current and voltage have opposite signs, i.e. between ωt = 0, and ωt = π / 2.<br>
The power is positive when the current and voltage have the same signs, i.e. between ωt = π / 2, and ωt = π.<br>
Between ωt = 0, and ωt = π / 2, the capacitor takes energy from the generator.<br>
Between ωt = π / 2, and ωt = π, the capacitor gives back energy to the generator.<br>
So the power consumed by a capacitor in an AC circuit has an average value of zero watt.<br>
A capacitor in an AC circuit consumes zero net energy.<br>

Charging an electrolytic capacitor<br>
Electrolytic capacitors have a thin layer of aluminium oxide as dielectric between two strips of aluminium foil as plates, e.g. 0.1 F (100, 000 F).<br>
One plate is marked + and should be charged positively.<br>
In diagram 30.5.6.5, electrons flow from the negative terminal of the battery to plate Y of the capacitor, and from plate X of the capacitor to the positive terminal of the battery.<br>
Positive charge builds up on the X plate and negative charge builds up on the Y plate, until the potential difference between the plates is equal and opposite to the potential difference of the battery, i.e. 1.5 V.<br>
Electron flow then stops and the meters, which had shown equal flicks during the charging, return to zero.<br>
The capacitor now has charge Q, i.e. one plate has charge +Q and the other plate has charge -Q.<br>
If V = 1.5 V and C = 500 F (farad), Q = VC,<br>
= 1.5 V x 500 F,<br>
= 1.5 x 500 x 10-6,<br>
= 750 x 10-6 coulombs.<br>
Electrolytic capacitors usually consist of two rolls of aluminium foil.<br>
The positive plate roll has a layer of aluminium oxide dielectric on its surface.<br>
The foil layers are separated by paper soaked in electrolyte.<br>
Electrolytic capacitors have capacitor values from 0.47 µF to 2500 µF.<br>
Electrolytic capacitors are polarized capacitors, for more than 1 F.<br>
They must be connected with correct polarity.<br>
Axial electrolytic capacitors have leads are attached to each end.<br>
Radial electrolytic capacitors have both leads are at the same end for use on printed circuit boards and to take less space.<br>
The value of electrolytic capacitors are printed on them showing capacitance and voltage rating, e.g. 6 volts.<br>
Electrolytic capacitors contain an electrolyte.<br>
If the voltage rating is exceeded, the capacitor can be damaged.<br>
The capacitor should have with a rating greater than the circuit's power supply voltage, e.g. 25 volts.<br>
The capacitors in which the anode is present in it such a way that it possesses a layer of oxidized material which acts as the dielectric.
Hence these are known as the Electrolytic capacitors.
These are preferred in the DC power application circuits.

Tantalum bead capacitors are used where a large capacitance, 0.1 muF to 100 muF, is needed in a small size and are usually polarized.<br>
Use in place of electrolytic capacitors of the same values.<br>
(Comment: Tantalum capacitors should NOT be used in place of electrolytics, because in electrolytics quite different design and application rules.<br>
s operate best when close to their rated voltage, but tantalums fail as a power of the applied voltage, so they are best used at small proportions of the rated voltage.)<br>

Variable capacitors have one set of plates that can moves relative to the other, e.g. in the tuning circuit of transistor radios.<br>
Variable air capacitors have two parallel sets of metal plates, a fixed set and a moving set.<br>
Tuners vary the capacitance by rotating the plates of the moving set between the plates of the fixed set and so change the capacitance.<br>
The maximum capacitance with the plates fully interleaved is about 0.0005 F.<br>
Radio and television tuners use low resistance RLC circuits to distinguish sharply between frequencies of different radio and television transmitters.<br>
Some announcers still say "Stayed tuned!" just before an advertisement starts.<br>
Variable capacitors can be varied by moving a rotating shaft.<br>
Usually used with a tuning dial with the radio stations marked.<br>
The smaller "trimmer capacitors" from 1.5 pf to 160 pF are used with larger fixed value capacitor.<br>
The larger are used in transistor radios, used to tune different radio stations.<br>
(Comment: The physical size is related to the applied voltage.<br>
The capacitance is related to the operating frequency.<br>
So large variable capacitors are used in broadcast transmitters.<br>
Small variable capacitors are used in transistorized portable receivers.<br>
High capacity is used for low frequency.<br>
Small capacity is used for higher frequencies or as trimmers for larger capacitors.)<br>

<a href="../images/31.8.1.0.gif">See diagram 31.8.1.0</a>: Discharge curve of a capacitor.<br>
As a capacitor charges, a potential difference accumulates between the parallel plates and it becomes fully charged when the potential difference across the plates is equal to the electromotive force of the source.<br>
If the capacitor is disconnected from this source, it can be used to make a current flow around a circuit.<br>
But as charge flows during the discharge, the potential difference across the capacitor drops, so the capacitor can only supply a "burst" of energy.<br>

<a href="../images/31.8.1.3.gif">See diagram 31.8.1.3</a>: Parallel plate capacitor.<br>
Charge is spread evenly over the plate with an electric field uniform in direction and magnitude except near the edge of the plate.<br>
The electric field is at right angles to the plate and its size is independent of the distance from the plate.<br>
A parallel plate capacitor consists of two identical conducting plates separated by a distance.<br>
So the electric field should be uniform between the plate, but does not exist outside the plates.<br>
The capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor is inversely proportional to the distance of separation of the plates.<br>
Experiment<br>
1. Mix semolina (wheat middlings) or grass seeds in castor oil.<br>
Pour the oil mixture between the plates of a parallel plate capacitor.<br>
When a potential difference is applied between the two plates, the seeds show the directions of the electric field lines.<br>
Before use, electrolytic capacitors should be correctly connected across the battery for minute to ensure that the plates are formed.<br>
Charge a large capacitor, e.g. 500 muF (50 V working) with no resistor in the circuit.<br>
Connect 4 volts from a 12 volt battery or power pack to the two plates of the capacitor through two galvanometers, or microammeter, each side of the capacitor.<br>
When the switch is closed, see the momentary pulses of current, positive charge to one plate and negative charge to the other plate, then no more current.<br>
Remove the battery from the circuit with the flying lead to discharge the capacitor and observe momentary current in the opposite directions.<br>
3. Charge a 500 muF capacitor through a high resistor.<br>
Repeat 1. with a high resistance, e.g. 4.7 kohm in series with the capacitor.<br>
Observe the slow charging process as the current dies exponentially as the charge rises to full value.<br>
Remove the battery from the circuit with the flying lead to discharge the capacitor and observe momentary current in the opposite directions.<br>
You can see the same current patterns using 5 kV from a power pack to charge 0.001 muF (20 kV working) capacitor.<br>
4. Charge a 0-001 muF capacitor using a van de Graaff generator and then short circuit it.<br>
Charge the 0.001 muF capacitor by holding the capacitor horizontally in a clamp and connecting the stud mounting end to the earthed negative terminal of the power supply.<br>
Connect the positive terminal to the capacitor through a 100 ohm resistor.<br>
Include a very high resistance in series to avoid damaging the capacitor, e.g. wet string.<br>
Connect the end of the resistor to the top of the capacitor with an insulated flexible lead held by hand.<br>
After a few seconds, remove this flexible lead.<br>
Use another insulated lead to short circuit the capacitor.<br>
Hold the insulated flying lead by hand against the sphere so that it can readily be removed from contact and used to short circuit the capacitor.<br>
Be careful! Two cm sparks can be obtained from a capacitor charged in this way!<br>
This experiment shows that the charged capacitor can produce sparks when it has been charged from an electrostatic source.<br>
The capacitors may not be designed for use at these voltages and may 
breakdown.<br>
5. Change the spacing of a charged parallel plate capacitor while it is attached to an electroscope.<br>
<a href="../images/31.8.1.5m.gif">See diagram 31.8.1.5</a>: Spacing of a charged parallel plate capacitor.<br>
* Vary the spacing of a charged parallel plate capacitor while the voltage is measured with an electroscope field and voltage.<br>
* Charge a simple capacitor of two parallel movable plates and the divergence of electroscope leaves varies as the plates are moved.<br>
* Charge parallel plates with a rod watch and the electroscope as the distance between the plates is changed.<br>
6. The relationship between capacitance and plate separation for a parallel plate capacitor, C = κ εoA/d, i.e. capacitance is inversely proportional to separation distance.<br>
Test this relationship by using increasing the numbers of sheets of paper or plastic or other dielectric material.<br>
However, the inverse relationship (C X 1/d) may not hold, because of the air between the sheets.<br>
To remove the air effect, add weights to the capacitor or increase the width of the plastic, e.g. use builder's plastic, thickness 50 μm, 100 μm, and 150 μm, so there is no air gap.<br>

<a href="../images/31.8.2.0.gif">See diagram 31.8.2.0</a>: Effect of a dielectric.<br>
 A dielectric is a non-conductor of electric charge, i.e. an insulator.<br>
 It can be a solid, liquid or gas that can keep an electric field constant.<br>
 Dielectrics are used in electric cables, electric terminals and capacitors.<br>
 The dielectric constant, K, relative permittivity, of a material measures how effectively it reduces an electric field across it.<br>
 The dielectric strength of a material expressed in volts per millimetre indicates the maximum potential difference gradient that can be applied to it before it breaks down and starts conducting electrons across it.<br>
 Non-conductors do not allow a flow of charge, but there is still a displacement of charge within them when a potential difference is applied.<br>
 Insulation material includes alcohol, quartz, dry gases, glass, pure water, sulfur, whereas conductors include aluminium, copper and silver.<br>
Although there is no sharp division between conductors and insulators, electrical conductivity, specific conductance, is a measure of current-carrying 
 ability of a material when an electrical potential difference is placed across it and an electric current flows through it.<br>
 Electrical conductivity, symbol σ, is the ratio of current density to
electric field strength and is measured in the derived unit 
 siemens per metre, S m-1.<br>
 Examples include silver, best metal conductor, 63.0 × 106 
S m-1, copper 58.6 × 106 S m-1, gold 45.2 
 × 106 S m-1, 
 deionized water 5.5 × 10-6 S m-1, and<br>
 air 0.3 to 0.8 × 10-14 S m-1.<br>
 Semiconductors, e.g. silicon, germanium, have electrical conductivity 
in the range 103 to 10-7 S m-1.<br>
 The electrical conductivity of solutions used in hydroponics, aquaculture 
 and water quality control is measured with an EC meter 
 (electrical conductivity meter).<br>

 Vacuum permittivity, symbol ε, permittivity of free space, electric constant = 8.8541878 × 10-12 farads per metre, F / m 
 Relative permittivity, symbol εr, dielectric constant, includes

 air = 1.0006., PTFE / Teflon 2.1, Pyrex glass 4.7, rubber 7, silicon 12, ethylene glycol 37, porcelain is × 7 relative permittivity for air.<br>
2. Dielectric constant is an important parameter for characterizing capacitors.<br>
 The term dielectric indicates the energy storing capacity of a material 
 by polarization.<br>
 The larger the dielectric constant, the more charge can be stored.<br>
 So capacitance is maximized if the dielectric constant is maximized, 
and the capacitor plates have large area and are placed as close 
 together as possible.<br>
 If a metal was used for the dielectric instead of an insulator the field
inside the metal would be zero, corresponding to an infinite 
 dielectric constant.<br>
 The dielectric usually fills the entire space between the capacitor plates.<br>
 Dielectric constant, K, relative permittivity = permittivity of a material, absolute permittivity, <i>ε(ω)</i> / permittivity of free space, ε0 = 
 <i>ε(ω)</i> / ε0.<br>

<a href="../images/31.8.3.1.gif">See diagram 31.8.3.1</a>: Leyden jar.<br>
 1. A Leyden jar is a glass jar with metal foil on inside and outside surfaces invented in the Netherlands' town of Leyden about 1745.<br>
 It was the early form of a capacitor and can act as a high voltage capacitor, e.g. 2000 pF.<br>
 Put aluminium foil into a 250 mL wide mouth glass jar to one third of the height of the jar.<br>
 Cover the jar externally with aluminium foil to the same height as the internal foil.<br>
 Push a large nail through a cork.<br>
 Use pliers to twist the end of the nail to form a hook.<br>
 Make a hole in the plastic lid of the glass jar so that the cork fits tightly through it.<br>
 Fix the cork into the hole in the lid.<br>
 Connect a chain of paper clips to the hook.<br>
 Touch the head of the nail with a plastic rod rubbed with fur.<br>
 Repeat this action ten times to accumulate electric energy to the Leyden jar.<br>
 The paper clip chain carries charge from the nail head to the aluminium foil in the jar.<br>
 The plastic lid of the glass jar is an insulator.<br>
When the jar is fully charged, use an insulated wire to connect the nail head with the external aluminium foil.<br>
 A spark bounces out from the point of the contact.<br>
2. Make a grounded Leyden jar.<br>
 Sparks from a Wimshurst machine are no longer, but are much more intense when a Leyden jar is connected.<br>

 Make a spark to show that the charge is still there.<br>
3. Make series and parallel condensers.<br>

 Next charge three in series with one in parallel and discharge singly and three in series.<br>
 Compare the length and intensity of sparks.<br>

 After charging a Leyden jar, light a neon tube up to 100 times.<br>
 Also show the polarity of charge on the dielectric with a triode residual charge.<br>
6. Use Leyden jars with a Toepler-Holtz machine.<br>
 The Toepler-Holtz machine produces weak sparks without the Leyden jars and strong less frequent sparks with the jars connected.<br>
7. Water cup spark collector<br>
<a href="../images/31.1.4.gif">See diagram 31.1.4</a>: Water cup spark collector.<br>
 Put a plastic cup 3 / 4 full of water into a plastic container containing water the same height as the water in the cup.<br>
 Bend two pieces of bare copper wire at on end so that they can stand upright.<br>
 Put one piece of copper wire in the cup and the other in the plastic container.<br>
 Rub a glass rod with a piece of silk then touch the copper wire standing in the plastic cup.<br>
 When you repeat this action 10 times, you are charging the capacitor.<br>
 Hold the end of the copper wire in the outer container with a clothes peg and move it towards to the centre copper wire.<br>
 Observe a spark jumping between the two copper wires.<br>
It is similar to the Leyden jar except the collecting surfaces are water separated by plastic instead of aluminium separated by glass to store charges.<br>
 When a glass rod is rubbed with a piece of silk, the centre wire water accumulates positive charges.<br>
 When a plastic rod is rubbed with fur, the centre wire accumulates negative charges.<br>

Hand-held, non-contacting electrostatic voltmeter instruments (ESV) are used where surface contact on conductive or insulative objects must be avoided.<br>
They are insensitive to variations in probe-to-surface distances, and prevent arc-over between the probe and measured surface.<br>
A surface DC voltmeter measures voltage with no electron transfer and so there is no charge transfer.<br>
The instrument may measures surface potential 3000 volts without contacting the measured surface.<br>

<a href="../images/38.4.1d.gif">See diagram 38.4.1</a>: Capacitors, charge and discharge.<br>
A capacitor stores energy in the form of an electric field between the oppositely charged plates.<br>
A capacitor has two conducting metal plates separated by a non-conducting material, a dielectric.<br>
When electricity supply is applied to the capacitor the electrons start moving from one plate to the other and start accumulating on the other plate, because the dielectric in between does not conduct electricity.<br>
So one plate has many positive charges and other plate has few negative charges, which causes an electric field to form between the two plates.<br>
The electric field makes the molecules in the dielectric get aligned towards the field in a direction which prevents the charge carriers from moving across.<br>
The capacitor is said to be fully charged.<br>
If a load is connected between the two metal plates, the capacitor discharges.<br>
Experiment<br>
1. Capacitance of a capacitor = charge on each plate per voltage between plates, C = Q / V.<br>
The SI unit of capacitance the farad, F, is equivalent to 1 coulomb per volt.<br>

3. Bulb dims as the capacitor charges.<br>
A 5600 μF capacitor, a light bulb, and a 120 V dc supply in series show a long time constant where the bulb dims as the capacitor charges.<br>
Similarly when current is switched off to a device containing light bulbs.<br>
The bulbs continue to grow after switching off, because of current stored in the capacitors.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="31.8.5.0H">31.8.5.0</a> RC time constants<br>
See diagram: <a href="../images/RCtimeconstant.jpg">31.8.5.0</a> Charging and discharging curve for a capacitor.<br>
The RC time constant, <a href="../images/tau.png">tau</a> or T, is the time constant in seconds of an RC circuit = circuit resistance (in ohms) X circuit capacitance (in farads).<br>
The RC time constant is the time taken by a capacitor to charge from an initial charge voltage of zero about 63% of the voltage charging it.<br>
If a capacitor is already fully charged, the RC time constant is the time it taken for it discharge to 63% of its fully charged voltage.<br>
The larger the resistance in the circuit, the longer the charge / discharge time.<br>
Charging and discharging a capacitor follows a non-linear curve.<br>
Time constant (τ) ( in seconds) = RC, where R is the resistance value of the resistor and C is the capacitance of the capacitor.<br>
Time constant is affected by the resistance of the resistor and the capacitance of the capacitor.<br>
The larger the resistance or the capacitance the longer it takes for a capacitor to charge or discharge.<br>
The smaller the resistance and capacitor values, the shorter time it takes for a capacitor to charge or discharge.<br>
In a circuit where a 9-volt battery is charging a 1000µF capacitor through a 3KΩ resistor:<br>
Time constant, RC = (10KΩ) X (100µF) = 3 seconds, when the capacitor is charged to 63% of the 9 volts from the battery, i.e. about 5.67 volts.<br>
For the circuit in <a href="../images/31.8.5.0.gif">diagram 31.8.5.0</a>, the RC time constant is 1 second<br>
