<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="26.1.1H"> 26.1.1</a> Interference and diffraction of sound, beats<br>
When a musician first blows across an opening of a tube an air stream forms that splits on the inside edge.<br>
Some air flows across the tube and some air flows into the tube to cause a downward pull of air particles into the tube.<br>
When all the air stream flows into the tube, a compression forms and the air stream splits again.<br>
But this time, the part that flows across the tube creates an upward push and all of the air stream flows across opening of the tube.<br>
When the compression reached the bottom of the tube it was reflected by the bottom of the closed tube and the compression reflected back as a rarefaction.<br>
This first rarefaction caused reflected compression wave travelling up the tube.<br>
This leads to constructive interference with the next compressions travelling down the tube.<br>
At the top of the open tube, compressions are reflected as compressions, in phase with the next compression, providing constructive interference.<br>
The wave pattern is stabilizes as a standing wave.<br>
The places constructive interference become the antinodes of the wave, while the areas of destructive interference become the nodes.<br>
A tube vibrating with a standing wave pattern of three antinodes and three nodes is vibrating at the 5th harmonic.<br>
A closed tube can only vibrate at odd harmonics, 1st harmonic ( fundamental), the 3rd harmonic, 5th harmonic.<br>
Sound waves show reflection, e.g. echoes from a wall.<br>
Sound waves show refraction, i.e. bend towards the normal when pass into media in which their speed is slower.<br>
For example, music sounds louder at night, because sound waves bend away from the normal and back towards the ground in the cooler air.<br>
Sound waves show diffraction, e.g. you can hear people talking around the corner, even when on opposite sides of a large tree.<br>
Sound waves can come through a keyhole and spread throughout the room.<br>
 Experiment<br>
 Use 3 sound insulation boards with the same size.<br>
 Drill a hole at the centre of each board.<br>
 Upright place the 3 boards parallel to one another.<br>
 Adjust their positions to make the 3 holes at one straight line.<br>
 Place a watch outside of the hole on the first board and press your ear  close the hole on the third board.<br>
 You may hear the "tick tick" the watch emits clearly.<br>
 It shows the sound travels to the ear directly through 3 holes.<br>
 Move the middle board a bit to make the 3 holes not at a straight line.<br>
 Although the sound does not travel to your ear directly, but you may hear the sound still, because the sound waves may round the  obstacle to go ahead.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="26.1.2H">26.1.2</a> Interference of sound  waves with tuning forks<br>
 Two sound waves of the same frequency and amplitude may give rise to easily observed interference effects at a point through which  they both pass.<br>
 If the crests of one wave fall on the crests of the other, the two waves  are said to be in-phase.<br>
 In that case, they reinforce each other and give rise to a high intensity at that point.<br>
 However, if the crests of one wave fall on the troughs of the other, the two waves will exactly cancel each other.<br>
 No sound will then be heard at the point.<br>
 The two waves are then 180<sup>o</sup>, or a half wavelength, out-of-phase.<br>
 Intermediate effects are observed if the two waves are neither in phase  nor 180<sup>o</sup> out-of-phase, but have a fixed phase relationship  in between.<br>
 At the certain condition, two or more sound waves interact and combine  to produce a resultant wave of larger or smaller amplitude.<br>
 Experiment<br>
 Hold the handle of a tuning fork and knock it with a rubber hammer to start its vibration.<br>
 Touch the rim of a table with the top of the tuning fork.<br>
 Place the tuning fork upright near your ear.<br>
 Gently rotate the tuning fork around a vertical axis for a circle (360<sup>o</sup>).<br>
 Take care of the change in volume.<br>
 The vibration of the tuning fork generates the vibration of the table at the same frequency.<br>
 They meet the condition of interference and form the interference field.<br>
 Rotate the tuning fork to change the distribution of sound intensity.<br>
 So you may hear the loudest sound 4 times and the lowest (nearly silent)  sound 4 times.<br>
 Silent zones can sometimes occur near a sound source, even when a sound  can be heard further away.<br>
 This happens when sound waves speed up and are refracted as they pass through warm air.<br>
 The sound is deflected up and over a location causing a silent zone.<br>
 If the sound then hits a belt of cold air as it rises then it will be refracted down again as it slows down.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="26.1.3H">26.1.3</a> Interference of two sound sources<br>
 Feed a signal from a signal generator into the auxiliary input of a stereo amplifier and set to 3-5 kHz.<br>
 Position the speakers about 2 m six feet apart, directed towards the audience.<br>
 Move the microphone probe along line A-B to see the nodes and antinodes displayed as minima and maxima on the C.R.O.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="26.1.4H">26.1.4</a> Loaded tuning fork<br>
<a href="../images/26.8.6.gif">See diagram 26.8.6</a>: Loaded tuning fork.<br>
 Use two tuning forks with the same frequency.<br>
 Wrap a piece of sticking plaster around one prong of one tuning fork.<br>
 Sound each tuning for separately.<br>
 Note that the loaded tuning fork has reduced frequency.<br>
 Sound the two tuning forks together.<br>
 Note the throbbing sound due to the waxing and waning of the resultant  amplitude.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="26.1.5H">26.1.5</a> Resonating objects have same frequency as source of vibration<br>
 Put two upright stands 50 cm apart and attach a string between them at the same height.<br>
 Tie the short lengths of string to seven metal washers.<br>
 Hang the washers on the horizontal string at the following hanging string  lengths:<br>
 washer l (20 cm), washer 2 (15 cm), washer 3 (20 cm)., washer 4 (15 cm),  washer 5 (5 cm), washer 6 (10 cm, washer 7 (5 cm).<br>
 Start swinging washer 7 and observe the other washers.<br>
 Washer 2 and washer 4 starts swinging with swing with washer 7.<br>
 Repeat the experiment with washer 2 swinging first.<br>
 Repeat the experiment with washer 1 swinging first.<br>
 Washer 3 starts swinging with it.<br>
 Washer 7 can be compared with the source of vibration and washer 2 and washer 4 have the same frequency of vibration.<br>
 The same happens when washer 2 or washer 4 is started to swing first.<br>
 The washers that have the same hanging string length will swing with the  original swinging.<br>
 The source of vibration can increase its own vibrations, e.g. when wind blows on it.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="26.1.6H">26.1.6</a> Sound waves extinguish a fire<br>
1.  Fire can be extinguished by amplified tone, because pressure waves sound disrupt the air enough to snuff out the flame.<br>
 Similarly oil well fire fighters use explosives to put out flames when the blast wave pushes away the oxygen that fuels the fire.<br>
 A defense roject has developed a fire extinguisher for use in small spaces using two speakers playing a specific low frequency either side of a liquid fuel flame.<br>
 The sound increases air velocity to thin the area of the flame where combustion occurs, i.e. the flame boundary, making the flame easier to extinguish.<br>
 The acoustics also disturb the surface of fuel and create higher fuel vaporization that widens the flame, making it less concentrated and easier to extinguish.<br>
Experiment<br>
Sound waves extinguish a candle flame<br>
 Cut the base off a plastic drink bottle.<br>
 Stretch a thin sheet of plastic or rubber over the cut base and secure it with an elastic band around the base.<br>
 Light a small birthday cake candle.<br>
 Hold the opening of the plastic drink bottle near the lighted candle.<br>
 Strongly tap the plastic sheet at the other end.<br>
 The vibration can extinguish the flame.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="26.1.7H">26.1.7</a> Superposition of waves<br>
1. Superposition  of waves of different frequencies, beats<br>
<a href="../images/26.8.4.4.gif">See diagram: 26.8.4.4</a>: Beats.<br>
 Superposition of sound waves of similar frequency produces pulsation called beats.<br>
 Beats consist of booming sounds of wave reinforcements alternating with quieter sounds of wave annulments.<br>
 The number of beats per second depends on the difference between the frequencies, e.g. two beats per second will occur with 
 combined frequencies of 200 Hz and 198 Hz.<br>
Sound waves can form interference patterns, beats.<br>
 You hear different frequencies of vibration as differences in pitch, i.e. higher frequencies as high notes and lower frequencies as low  notes.<br>
 If two tuning forks with frequencies of 256 hertz and 254 hertz are sounded  simultaneously and at a certain instant an observer  simultaneously receives a compression from each fork, the observer hears  a loud sound.<br>
One quarter of a second later, the 256 hertz tuning fork has gained one half of a vibration on the 254 hertz tuning fork, so the observer simultaneously receives a compression from one tuning fork and a rarefaction from the other tuning fork.<br>
The compressions and rarefactions annul, or partly annul, each other and the observer hears minimum sound intensity.<br>
 After another quarter second, when one tuning fork has gained one vibration  on the other, the observer again simultaneously receives two  compressions and the sound is again of maximum intensity.<br>
 During the time interval in which one tuning fork gains one vibration  on the other, the sound intensity passes through one cycle of  change, i.e., one beat is heard.<br>
 There will be two beats per second, because the 256 hertz tuning fork makes  two vibrations more than the 254 hertz tuning fork.<br>
 If two sources of sound of frequencies f1 and f2 are simultaneously emitting sound waves, then the source of higher frequency, f1, gains one vibration on that of lower frequency (f1 - f2) times per second and an observer hears (f1 - f2) beats per second.<br>
 The number of beats per second is equal to the difference between the frequencies of the two sources.<br>
 If two notes of slightly different frequencies are sounded together they  interfere and periodically produce a loud sounding large  amplitude called a beat.<br>
 Beats are used by piano tuners to tune instruments.<br>
 If two wave trains of frequencies 4 and 5 hertz are propagated so that each particle is subject to the joint action of the two waves, the displacement at any instant of any particle will be the algebraic sum of the separate displacements due to each wave.<br>
 In the diagram, Curve 1. shows for a given particle the time displacement  graph due to the wave train of frequency 5 hertz.<br>
 Curve 2. is the time displacement graph for the wave train of frequency  4 hertz.<br>
 The graphs are drawn in each case for an interval of two seconds.<br>
 At an instant represented by the point A, the displacements, AB and AC, due to the two separate waves are both to the same side of the mean position of the particle and its resultant displacement at this instant is AD in Curve 3., equal to AB + AC.<br>
 At the instant of time represented by the point E, the displacements due  to the separate waves are to opposite sides of the mean  position of the particle so the resultant displacement is EH = EF + (- EG).<br>
 Curve 3. is the resultant time displacement curve for any particle.<br>
 The resultant displacement is greatest when the displacement due to the  waves assist each other.<br>
 This waxing and waning of the resultant amplitude due to the superposition of two waves of like kind, but of different frequencies and is  called beats.<br>
 Experiment<br>
 For tuning octaves, with a tuning hammer on F#46, side strings muted with  rubber wedges, strike simultaneously already tuned F#34  and F#46.<br>
 Tune by adjusting the tension in the strings until all audible beats are eliminated and the two notes sound as a single one note.<br>
 Tune G47 in the same way and keep tuning every note towards the upper end of the keyboard, then tune the bass section.<br>
 2. Superposition of waves  of equal frequencies with tuning forks<br>
<a href="../images/26.8.4.1.gif">See diagram: 26.8.4.1</a>: Superposition with tuning forks.<br>
 Hold a vibrating tuning fork near your ear and slowly rotate it about its shaft.<br>
 Hear the sound alternating between loud and soft.<br>
 Note the four positions in one revolution at which almost no sound is heard, about 5 dB lower.<br>
 See in the diagram the ends, A and B, of the prongs as viewed from above.<br>
 * As the prongs approach each other, a compression forms at C and spreads  out in the directions shown by the arrows from C.<br>
 At the same time the rarefaction formed at R1 and R2 spread out as shown  by the arrows from R1 and R2.<br>
 So in the regions of the dotted lines a compression and a rarefaction arrive simultaneously and annul each other along these lines.<br>
 * As the prongs move apart, a rarefaction forms at C and compressions form at R1 and R2.<br>
 The rarefactions and compressions spread out to annul each other along  the dotted lines.<br>
 *. So along the dotted lines the pressure re mains constant and these lines are lines of zero sound.<br>
 The four positions of silence in one revolution of the fork correspond  to the four dotted lines.<br>
 The modifications of intensity obtained by superposing waves are called  interference effects.<br>
 *. However, if you sound the tuning fork at arm's length from your ear and rotate it about its long axis you will only hear two maxima and  two minima.<br>
 These two situations are called "near-field" (close to your ear), and "far-field"  (arm's length) sounds.<br>
 *. Some people have reported that the minima are not symmetrically spaced  at 45<sup>o</sup> from the plane of the fork, instead the first minima  occurs at approximately 54<sup>o</sup>.<br>
 * Connect a microphone or a loudspeaker to examine these patterns on an oscilloscope.<br>
 Clamp the tuning fork to the bench and moving the loudspeaker around.<br>
 This will be no easy task.<br>
 3. Superposition of waves  of equal frequencies with loudspeakers<br>
<a href="../images/26.8.4.2.gif">See diagram: 26.8.4.2</a>: Superposition with loudspeakers.<br>
 * Mount two loudspeakers, A and B, near each other and operate them from the same source of high frequency, e.g. 3 000 cycles per  second.<br>
 The sound waves originating at each loudspeaker are superimposed in the region in front of them.<br>
 * At those points at which a compression from one loudspeaker arrives at  the same instant as a rarefaction from the other loudspeaker,  annulment occurs and the sound intensity is zero.<br>
 * At points where two compressions, or two rarefactions, arrive simultaneously,  reinforcement results from the superposition of the two  wave trains and these points are regions of maximum sound intensity.<br>
 The thick and thin arcs represent the instantaneous positions of the zones of compression and rarefaction from A and B.<br>
 At points marked x, annulment occurs and these points of zero sound intensity  lie along lines radiating from between A and B.<br>
 The points of intersection of two thick lines or of two thin ones are regions of maximum intensity.<br>
 * The existence of the above pattern in the region in front of A and B can be made evident by exploring the sound field with a microphone.<br>
 It is found that alternating zones of maximum and zero sound as the microphone is moved across the sound field.<br>
* Use a sensitive flame to explore the interference pattern by keeping the flame in a fixed position and slowly rotate the sources of sound.<br>
 The flame alternately dips and rises as the lines of maximum and zero intensity pass over it.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="26.1.8H">26.1.8</a> Two slit interference  with microwaves<br>
 Direct a microwave transmitter towards a large metal screen with two slits separated by a distance comparable to the wavelength, 3 cm.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="26.1.9H">26.1.9</a> Ultrasonics, ultrasonic interference<br>
 Ultrasonics are vibrations whose frequencies are higher than the upper audibility limit for humans, i.e. 20 kHz.<br>
 Ultrasonic waves are used by bats for navigation in the dark, and used by ships in the ultrasonic system called sonar to find fish and  measure the depth of the sea.<br>
 For jet planes the speed of sound is measured in Mach numbers (Ernst Mach 1838-1916).<br>
 A Mach number is the ratio of the velocity of an object in air to the velocity of sound in air.<br>
 Sonic speed = the speed of sound.<br>
 Subsonic speed &lt; speed of sound.<br>
 A jet plane travelling at supersonic speed, i.e. &gt; Mach 1, is travelling faster than the speed of sound and leaves a cone shaped shock  wave behind it heard as a very loud noise called a sonic boom.<br>
 A jet plane "breaks the sound barrier" when its speed increases through Mach 1.<br>
 The sound barrier divides subsonic speed from supersonic speed.<br>
 The first pilot to "break" the sound barrier and survive was Captain Chuck  Yeager in 1947 working in an US government program.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="26.2.2H">26.2.2</a> Musical note<br>
 In general, musical sounds are made up of a certain limited number of frequencies.<br>
 A resultant wave includes a set of simple harmonic waves, in which the fundamental frequency, f1, is the lowest and nf1 is harmonics.<br>
 A musical note is a notation representing the pitch and duration of a musical sound, which has a characteristic pitch, loudness and quality.<br>
 The pitch of a sound is related to its frequency of vibrations, the "highness" or "lowness".<br>
 The pitch is dependent on the fundamental.<br>
 The loudness of a sound depends on the ability of the ear to "hear", which depends on the movement of the eardrum as sound waves arrive.<br>
 The bigger the movement of the ear drum, the stronger will be the signals sent to the brain, and the louder the sound you hear.<br>
 The loudness is the psychological reaction to the intensity of a sound.<br>
 Quality or timbre is another parameter related to the psychological reaction.<br>

 1. The speed of sound travelling in gas depends on the density of the gas.<br>
 The denser the gas, the slower sound travels.<br>
 Sound travels at about 340 metres per second in air and about 270 metres  per second in carbon dioxide.<br>
 So sound should be refracted towards the normal when it moves from air to carbon dioxide.<br>
 Blow up a balloon.<br>
 Hold it against a fairly loud source of sound.<br>
 Place your hands or cheek against the balloon to feel the vibrations.<br>
 You hear sounds when their waves hit and vibrate your eardrums.<br>
 2. A balloon under pressure has a higher index of acoustic refraction than the surrounding air, so it behaves as a sound lens.<br>
 Use a balloon and a microphone to listen to distant conversations.<br>
 Use a balloon and a tiny loudspeaker to project a sound beam to an individual  listener.<br>
 Put some dry ice, frozen carbon dioxide, in a balloon.<br>
 Tie off the balloon and weigh it on a balance.<br>
 Watch the "weight" change as the dry ice sublimes.<br>
 When the balloon is fully inflated use it as a sound lens.<br>
 Use an incoherent source of sound, e.g. running water.<br>
 Use an oscilloscope and microphone to measure the speed of sound through  the balloon filled with carbon dioxide then calculate the  index of refraction and focal length for the higher frequencies.<br>
 3. Hold an inflated balloon 10 cm from a transistor radio.<br>
 Squeeze the balloon between your two hands and note the feeling.<br>
 Turn up the volume of the radio and squeeze as before.<br>
 Note the difference in feeling.<br>
 4. Balloons filled with different gases either focus or defocus sound waves.<br>
 Fill the balloon with helium, carbon dioxide or air.<br>
 Place the balloon between a small speaker and a microphone and measure the microphones output.<br>
 Carbon dioxide focuses the sound, but helium defocuses the sound, with air of course there is no difference.<br>
 5. Inflate a balloon with your mouth then tie its mouth.<br>
 Place the balloon between a watch and your ear and press close to each other.<br>
 You may hear the "tick tick" the watch emits.<br>
 There is more carbon dioxide in the gas you breathe out compared with air so the gas inside the blown-up balloon has bigger  proportion of carbon dioxide than air.<br>
 The balloon also contains water vapour breathed out.<br>
 The gas inside the balloon is denser than air outside the balloon, because  carbon dioxide is denser than air.<br>
 Sound travels more slowly in a denser gas so sound waves refract on the surface of the blown-up balloon to collect together, just like  a lens.<br>
 The sharper the curvature of the balloon lens the smaller its focal length.<br>
 Pull strings attached to the surface of the balloon to vary the thickness  of the balloon lens.<br>
 As there are more sound signals arriving your ear your ear may hear very  low sound more clearly.<br>
 6. Quiet or far away sounds are hard to hear, because sound energy spreads  out as it moves away from its source.<br>
 However, by using a balloon filled with carbon dioxide gas, you can focus sound waves to create a loud spot!<br>
 Put about 50 mL of crushed dry ice into a glass soft drink bottle.<br>
 Stretch the neck of a round balloon over the top of the bottle.<br>
 As the dry ice warms, carbon dioxide gas slowly fills the balloon, OR,<br> 
place the bottle in warm water to speed up the filling process.<br>
 When full, remove the balloon and tie the neck to prevent carbon dioxide  gas escaping.<br>
 You now have a "lens", which you can use to focus sound.<br>
 Balance the balloon on a coffee mug.<br>
 About one metre away on one side of the balloon, place a radio (or other  sound source) with the volume control turned down so that it  is only just audible.<br>
 Move your ear around on the opposite side of the balloon.<br>
 At what point is the sound loudest?<br>
 What happens if the balloon is removed when your ear is at that point?<br>
 What happens to the loud point when you move the radio closer or further  away from the balloon?<br>
 Carbon dioxide gas molecules slowly pass through the sides of the balloon,  so fill the balloon just before using it.<br>

 Listen to the sound of the clock through the below end of the tube.<br>

 Echo, absorption, transmission, string telephone, sound insulation, soundproofing,  acoustics, baffles<br>
 When a periodic disturbance occurs in air, longitudinal sound waves spread  out from it in three dimensions, just like the water waves  that spread out from a vibrating source in two dimensions.<br>
 The air in the path of a sound wave becomes alternately denser and rarer.<br>
 These changes in pressure cause your eardrums to vibrate with the same frequency to produce the sensation of sound.<br>
 The speed of sound in air is 332 m / sec at 0<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 The speed of sound increases by about 0.2% for each 1<sup>o</sup>C rise  in air temperature.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="26.4.1H">26.4.1</a> Analogue and digital  recording<br>
 The three types of recording mechanisms are mechanical, magnetic and optical.<br>
 In analogue transmission the characteristic of the transmission signal,  e.g. amplitude or frequency, varies in direct proportion to the  received sound or brightness of a picture.<br>
 The hands of a clock is a form of analogue recording.<br>
 In digital transmission the information is transmitted in a series of pulses thus eliminating unwanted noise.<br>
 The pressure from a sound wave can be sampled many times in a second and the values recorded in numerical form using the binary  code.<br>
 The closer the sampling the higher the fidelity of the sound recorded,  i.e. more closely repeats the original sound.<br>
 Later this information can be translated into the analogue form in the receiver.<br>
 Digitally recorded information can be stored on a CD or sent through the internet.<br>
 Analogue and digital units<br>
 An analog signal is a continuous signal which represents physical measurements.<br>
 Analog instruments usually have a scale which is cramped at lower end and give considerable observational errors.<br>
 Digital signals are discrete time signals best suited for computing and  digital electronics.<br>
 Digital instruments are free from observational errors like parallax and  approximation errors.<br>
 Whether digital is more accurate than analogue depends on the application.<br>
 A digital meter requires you to convert and compare present to a desired  value by maths.<br>
 Analogue meters relay a positional comparison that can be done in a glance.<br>
 In motor vehicles the speedometer is usually analogue, because it is easy to read and accuracy as it can be a distraction.<br>
 Most driver glance at the speedometer to check whether the vehicle is within the legal speed limit, but it is also an indication of safety in  certain road situations.<br>
 The accuracy of a speedometer to measure ground velocity can be affected  by the tyres used and their pressure.<br>
 The speed of a motor vehicle has usually constantly varying values, which  are much easier to see and recognize patterns with analogue  meters than digital meters.<br>
  
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="26.4.2H">26.4.2</a> Cassette recorder<br>
 A cassette recorder consists of the protective plastic holder, the cassette, and two reels to allow the magnetic tape to pass from one reel to the other through an electromagnet recording head / reading head.<br>
 Rewinding allows repeated use.<br>
 Sound is recorded on the tape with magnetized particles of iron or chromium oxide.<br>
Electric current from a microphone that varies with a sound wave passes through a metal coil in the recording head that causes changes in its magnetic field to rearrange the random pattern of the metal particles on the "blank" magnetic tape into a pattern that can be read by the playback head as a sound wave to be amplified by a loudspeaker.<br>
 Experiment<br>
 Select a cassette container containing songs that you do not like.<br>

 Play the cassette and the songs you do not like sound worse.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="26.4.3H">26.4.3</a> Compact disc, CD<br>
 A compact disc, CD, stores sound as a binary code, represented by tiny pits or bumps etched into a layer of aluminium surrounded by flat areas called "land".<br>
 This is then coated with plastic for protection.<br>
 When the laser beam is shone at the disc some of it is reflected back by the smooth aluminium land, but not by the pits or bumps.<br>
 Light reflected from the shiny underside land is read as binary 1.<br>
 Light that hits the pit or bump is scattered and not reflected, so it is read as binary 0.<br>
 The result is a series of digital pulses to be converted to sound by a loudspeaker.<br>
 The laser itself does not touch the disc so it should not wear out.<br>
 When the laser is tracking the speed of needle as it goes from the outside disc near the centre the disc spins at 500 revolutions per minute, towards the centre of the record.<br>
 When it is tracking near the edge it spins at only 200 rpm so the same relative speed is maintained.<br>
The "bumps" on the smooth surface of compact discs, CDs, cause destructive interference of laser beams reflecting from the sides of the bumps, but no interference reflecting from the tops of the bumps or between the bumps.<br>
 Experiment<br>
 Let white light fall on the underside of a compact disc and note the diffraction caused by light passing through the gaps between the bumps.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="26.4.4H">26.4.4</a> Glass tube with an open end, using signal generator<br>
 1. Connect the loudspeaker to the fan out outlet of the signal generator with a piece of leader and place the loudspeaker at the open end of the glass tube.<br>
 Turn on the signal generator and adjust it to the lowest frequency.<br>
 The lower the frequency, the lower it sounds.<br>
 Gradually increase its frequency slowly until the sound increases suddenly, here the air inside the tube resonates with the sound of the signal generator so that a standing wave forms at the lowest frequency 
inside the tube.<br>
 The lowest frequency is called the fundamental, denoted as f<sub>1</sub>.<br>
 Measure the length of the glass tube, denoted as L.<br>
 f1 may be expressed as, v = f<sub>1</sub>w<sub>1</sub>, where v is the velocity of travelling wave along the air column, i.e. the sound spreading velocity in the 
 air, w<sub>1</sub> is wavelength, w<sub>1</sub>= 4L.<br>
 Gradually increase its frequency slowly again until the sound increases suddenly secondly.<br>
 It shows that the air inside the tube and the frequency of forced vibration meet the condition of resonance again.<br>
 The second standing wave forms, called harmonic wave, its wavelength, i.e. harmonic length denoted as L<sub>1</sub> and its frequency denoted as f<sub>2</sub>.<br>
 List the top four resonance frequencies.<br>
 The sound velocity is a constant under that temperature and the glass tube has only one open end.<br>
 So the frequency of the standing wave of the air column inside the glass tube is limited.<br>
 At the closed end of the glass tube, the air molecules do not move, so here must be the node of the standing wave.<br>
 At the open end, the air pressure is always equal to the atmosphere pressure so here the air is not contracted, i.e. it has no change in shape.<br>
 So the open end must be the antinode of the standing wave.<br>
 When the air column emits the first standing wave, there are only one node and one antinode in the tube according to the vibration of the fundamental.<br>
 When the air column emits the second standing wave, there are two nodes and two antinodes and the frequency of vibration is as three times as the fundamental.<br>
 The vibration of the air column inside the tube with only 1 open end may just form the standing wave whose frequency is odd number times of the fundamental.<br>
 2. Glass tube with two open ends, using signal generator<br>
 Methods are the same as above.<br>
 The 2 ends of the glass tube are all open so the two ends are all the antinodes of the standing wave.<br>
Corresponding to the vibration of the fundamental, there are one node and two antinodes in the tube, then two notes and three antinodes corresponding to the vibration of two times of the fundamental.<br>
 Thus the vibration of the air column inside the tube with only two open ends may form the standing wave whose frequency is an even number.<br>

 A gramophone (US phonograph) reproduces sound using with a stylus or needle that vibrates by following a groove on a revolving spiral disc made of vinyl plastic.<br>
 The needle vibrates in the groove and vibrates a diaphragm.<br>
 The sound produced this way is then made louder (amplified) by the horn on an old gramophone.<br>
 The original stylus was like a thorn and could be kept sharp with a pencil sharpener.<br>
 With repeated use the groove became worn causing loss of accuracy of the recorded sound and new sounds caused by dirt and dust.<br>
 This is a mechanical recording method.<br>
 Experiments<br>
 1. Poke a pin through the centre of the base of a polystyrene or cardboard cup.<br>
 Set the record on a turntable and start the turntable spinning.<br>
 Carefully hold the pin in the groove on the record and listen to the record at the opening of the cup.<br>
 The sound recorded in the grooves is being picked up by the pin and then turned into vibrations and transmitted by the cup.<br>
 Try the same activity with different sized cups.<br>
 Note how the size of the cup affect the sound produced.<br>
 2. Cut a point on one end of a match stick.<br>
 Cut the other end into two, length wise for about 1 / 4 the length if the match stick.<br>
 Fit a piece of stiff paper into the split end.<br>
 Hold the matchstick and paper point down onto an old 78 rpm phonograph records turning on a turntable.<br>
 You can hear music coming from the paper.<br>
 When you hold the match point in the grooves of the phonograph records the lateral vibrations from the grooves are transmitted to the paper.<br>
 Vibration of the paper produces vibrations in the air that carry to your ear drum, so you hear the sound.<br>

 Note how the magnet moves in response to the changing magnetic field that
 is produced in the coil as you change the setting on the

 A loudspeaker works in exactly the same way as a microphone, but in reverse.<br>
 An electric current from a microphone flows through the coil in the electromagnet
 that has a central pole and a surrounding ring pole.<br>
The force between the magnetic field of the coil and the magnet makes the coil vibrate in accordance with Fleming's left hand rule and the attached paper cone diaphragm vibrate to create sound waves as it pushes and pulls on the air next to it.<br>

 Sound waves cause the diaphragm to vibrate that in turn causes the carbon  blocks to move together or apart and change the current  between the power source and the receiver.<br>
 2. In the receiver, the variable current from the microphone passes through  the coils of an electromagnet that exerts variable magnetic  force on an iron diaphragm to produce sound waves.<br>
 3. A transducer converts a physical quantity, e.g. volume of sound, brightness  of light, temperature of hot object, into an electric signal,  or converts an electric signal into a physical quantity.<br>
 Transducers usually convert a non-electrical signal into an electrical  signal.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="26.5.01H">26.5.01</a> Speed of sound<br>
1. The speed of sound in air at room temperature, 20<sup>o</sup>C, v = 343 m /s.<br>
 As temperature of air increases, the molecules in air move faster, so the speed of sound increases with temperature.<br>
 The speed of sound is independent of pressure, frequency, and wavelength, but is proportional to the square root of the absolute (Kelvin) temperature.<br>
 The speed increases with temperature by about 0.61 m / s for each 1<sup>o</sup>C rise.<br>
 So speed of sound in air at 0<sup>o</sup> C = 331 m / s.<br>
 2. The speed of sound is faster in solids than liquids than gases, because the speed of sound through a material is related to the elasticity and density of the material.<br>
 For example speed of sound at 0<sup>o</sup>C of fresh water = 1 410 m / s, sea water = 1 540 m /s, wood 3 850 m /s, and steel 5960 m / s.<br>
 The speed of sound also increases with the intensity of the source, e.g. explosions.<br>
 3. The speed of sound can be measured by time of transmission between two amplifiers, time measurement replaced by a measurement of the inverse of time (frequency), v = fλ.<br>
 3.1 Kundt's tube is used to measure the speed of sound in any gas.<br>

When the speed of a source equals the speed of sound the wave fronts cannot escape the source.<br>
 The wave form a large amplitude "sound barrier" that makes flight difficult.<br>
 The term "sound barrier" or "sonic barrier" was used when pilots doing high speed dives noticed that as flying speeds approached the speed of sound: aerodynamic drag increased unusually and lift and manoeuvrability decreased.<br>
 When the speed of a source exceeds the speed of sound, the wave fronts 
lag behind the source in a cone-shaped region with the 
 source at the vertex.<br>
 The edge of the cone forms a supersonic wave front with an unusually large
 amplitude called a "shock wave".<br>
 The shock wave is heard as a "sonic boom".<br>
 Unlike ordinary sound waves, the speed of a shock wave varies with its 
amplitude.<br>
 The speed of a shock wave is always greater than the speed of sound in
 the fluid and decreases as the amplitude of the wave decreases.<br>
 When the shock wave speed equals the normal speed, the shock wave is reduced
to an ordinary sound wave.<br>
 The ratio of the speed of a moving object, v, to the speed of sound, c, 
in a fluid is called the Mach number in honour of Ernst Mach, 
 1838-1916.<br>
 Mach 0.5 is half the speed of sound and Mach 2 is twice the speed of sound.<br>
 Subsonic speeds have a Mach number between zero and one.<br>
 Supersonic speeds have Mach numbers greater than one.<br>

<a href="../images/26.3.01.gif">See diagram 26.3.01</a>: Closed resonance tube.<br>
 Measure the diameter of the resonance tube.<br>
 Add water to the glass cylinder until 3 / 4 full.<br>
 Hold the resonance tube vertically in the cylinder with one end in the water so the water seals one end of the tube.<br>
 You can raise and lower the tube to vary the length of the air column in the tube.<br>
 Strike the tuning fork with a rubber bung.<br>
 Hold the vibrating tuning fork horizontally close to the open end of the tube.<br>
 Move the tube and tuning fork up and down until the sound is best reinforced.<br>
 If you find more than one position where reinforcement occurs move the tube up and down to find the shortest tube length that gives the  loudest sound.<br>
 Hold the tube in the position of best sound reinforcement and measure the distance L from the top of the resonance tube to the water.<br>
 The length of the air column must be increased by 0.4 × diameter of the  tube to correct for the air outside the top of the tube that  vibrates with the air column in the tube.<br>
 The corrected length of the air column = 0.4 × diameter + L.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="26.5.6H">26.5.6</a> Speed of sound with  a drum<br>
 The speed of sound in air at 20<sup>o</sup>C is about 334 m / s.<br>
 The speed of light is 299, 792, 458 m / s.<br>
 1. Use a large drum, a 1 metre circumference trundle wheel or long measuring  tape.<br>
 Arrange students, on a calm day, in a large open area, e.g. an oval or a quiet straight road.<br>
 Hit the drum every half second using a watch or borrow a metronome from the music department or use a 1 metre long pendulum.<br>
 Walk 50 metres away from the drummer then the drummer repeats the exercise.<br>
 Walk another 50 metres and repeat.<br>
 At about 170 metres from the drummer you can observe that the drummer is hitting the drum exactly as the sound is heard, but after  stopping one "extra" beat is heard.<br>
If the light reaching the observer travels "instantaneously" from the drummer, the distance travelled by sound in a half second about 170 metres, so the speed of sound is about 340 metres per second.<br>
 2. Compared with the speed of sound, the speed of light is infinity, in air sound waves travel uniformly, viz. the speed of sound is a  constant so it may be calculated applying the formula on reform motion.<br>
 Use a drum or a wasted metallic pail, a piece of tape measure, a metronome  or a single pendulum.<br>
 Do this experiment at a silent and open playground.<br>
 Beat the drum 2 times every seconds, 6 times in all.<br>
 It is better to use the metronome to control the beating rhythm to assure  the interval coincident and exact.<br>
 Discover the difference in time between beating the drum and hearing the drum.<br>
 When observe and hear around the drummer firstly, you may see beating drum and hear the drum at the same time, at 50 m far away  from the drummer.<br>
 Secondly, you may see beating drum before hear the drum at the same time, but the difference in time is not large, at 100 m far away  from the drummer.<br>
 Thirdly, you may see beating drum before hear the drum at the same time,  and the difference in time is obvious.<br>
 Continue to see and hear.<br>
At 170 m far away from the drummer, you do not hear the drum when you see the first beating, you hear the first drum at the same time you see the second beating, you hear the second drum when you see the third beating, you may hear a "extra" drum at 0.5 s after the drummer finishes his beating.<br>
 Put t = 0.5 s and s = 170 m into the formula v = s X t, then get v = 340  m, i.e. the approximation of the speed of sound.<br>
 At this experiment suppose that the speed of light is infinity, viz. the  action of beating seen and the action of practical beating happens  at the same time no matter how far away from the drummer.<br>
 It will cause some error, but very small.<br>
 So the speed of sound obtained with the approximate method processes is  true enough.<br>
If there are 2 cellular phones, one around the drummer, another being carried at the observer, their loudspeakers may receive the drum at the same time, because electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed as light.<br>
In a sailboat race, the contestants should all start as soon as they see the smoke from the starting gun, not wait to hear the sound of the gun.<br>

 Speed of sound with a tuning fork to resonate a pipe<br>

 <a href="../images/26.3.02.gif">See diagram 26.3.02</a>: Reservoir-resonance tube apparatus.<br>
 1. A tuning fork can make the closed air column form a standing wave.<br>
 Strike a tuning fork then hold it over the open end of a resonance tube  in which the inner cylinder can be raised until resonance is 
 heard.<br>
 Another method is to use a measuring cylinder to be filled with water until resonance occurs.<br>
 For the frequency range 360 to 512, corresponding to a 3/4 lambda mode with the open end being the antinode.<br>
 The antinodes (A) are displacement antinodes (pressure nodes) and the 
nodes (N) are displacement nodes (pressure antinodes).<br>
 If the frequency is fixed, as in the case of the tuning fork held over 
 the open end of a tube:<br>
 The resonance lengths are v/4f, 3v/4f, 5v/4f and so on for a tube closed at one end.<br>
 The resonance lengths are, and v/2f, 2v/2f, 3v/2f for a tube open at both ends.<br>
 At resonance exists, the displacement is a minimum, i.e. a node, at the
 bottom closed end, but the antinode is a small distance beyond 
 the open end, called the end correction, e.<br>
 A water reservoir-resonance tube apparatus 1m long, tuning forks frequency 500 Hz, allows three positions of resonance, 
 L1, L2, and L3.<br>
 So wavelength of the sound wave = 4(L1 + e), 4/3(L2 + e), 4/5(L3 + e).<br>
 So wavelength = 2(L2 - L1), 2(L3 - L2) (L3 - L1).<br>
 For a closed cylindrical tube 1 m long, inside diameter 2.80 +- 0.01 cm, 
tuning forks of 480 Hz (B4) and 512 Hz (C5), e = 1.28 +- 0.05 cm.<br>
 Speed of sound, v = frequency of the tuning fork × wavelength.<br>
Experiment<br>
 2. Fix the a U-tube on the stand.<br>
 Pour water into the two glass arms.<br>
 Lift the right tube so that the surface of water in the left tube is just
 under point A, at the end of the left tube.<br>
 Knock the highest frequency tuning fork with a rubber hammer to start 
its vibration.<br>
 Put this tuning fork above the left tube.<br>
 Lower the right tube to lower the surface of water at the left tube so 
that the air column between the end and surface of water in the left 
 tube is lengthened.<br>
 When the water surface goes down from point A to C, the sound reaches 
the maximum.<br>
 It resonates with the tuning fork. The fundamental of the air column is
 the same as the frequency of vibration of the tuning fork.<br>
 Measure and record the length l<sub>1</sub> of the air column AC here.<br>
 Lengthen the air column AC further until you hear the resonance sound 
of the air column.<br>
 Knock the tuning fork again to make it keep vibrating.<br>
 Find the position of the second resonance point.<br>
 Record the length l<sub>2</sub> of the air column AC.<br>
 Record the frequency of the tuning fork and the room temperature.<br>
 Calculate the speed of sound by: v = 2f (l<sub>2</sub> - l<sub>1</sub>).<br>
 Repeat the experiment using other tuning forks and calculate the speed 
of sound.<br>
 3. Calculate the average of speed of sound and record as m / s.<br>
 The point A at the open end is the antinode of the standing wave.<br>
 Point C on the water surface is analogous to a fixed end is the node.<br>
 The distance between the node and the antinode is odd number times of 
1 / 4 wavelength.<br>
 l<sub>1</sub> + e = w / 4, corresponding to the first resonance point<br>
 l<sub>2</sub> + E = 3w / 4, corresponding to the second resonance point,  where w is the wavelength of the tuning fork, E is the correction of length.<br>
 E is used to adjusted the value of the length, because there is a short  distance between the tuning fork and the end of left tube.<br>
 The length of the air column is slightly larger than the length of AC,  the first formula above minus the second minus may get rid of E and  get : (l<sub>2</sub> - l<sub>1</sub>) = w / 2, so w may be found.<br>
 As v = fw, the speed of sound may be found.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="26.5.8H">26.5.8</a> Speed of sound with  echoes<br>
 1. Clap your hands 100 m from a high wall.<br>
 Keep clapping steadily until each clap coincides with the echo of the last clap.<br>
 Use a stopwatch to record the time between these claps.<br>
 Measure the distance from the wall.<br>
 During the time between claps the sound travels twice the distance from the wall.<br>
 The speed of sound in air at 0<sup>o</sup>C is about 331 m / s.<br>
 2. You need two pieces of wood to make a clapping sound, open space and a vertical flat surface outdoors, e.g. wall of school  building.<br>
 Face the wall 20 meters from the wall, and move very slowly backwards while clapping with the two pieces of wood pieces.<br>
 When an echo of the clapping sound is heard, measure the distance.<br>
 The minimum time interval that the human ear can detect between two claps  is 0.1 second.<br>
 When this interval between the clap and the echo is shorter than 0.1 second,  no echo is heard, so you hear no echo when you stand too  close to the wall.<br>
 By moving slowly backwards away from the wall, an echo will be heard at  a certain moment.<br>
 At this moment, the echo came back within 0.1 second, the distance between  observer and the wall is measured (about 17 m), and the  speed can be calculated from:<br>
 distance sound travelled (2 × 17 m 9 34 m) divided by the time (0.1 sec) equals 340 m / sec.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="26.5.9H">26.5.9</a> Windshear and noise  level, noise of thunder<br>
 Windshear (wind shear, wind gradient), refers to the lower wind speed near the ground, because of friction with objects on the ground  and uneven ground.<br>
 The wind velocity gradient tends to bend sound waves downward when moving in the same direction of the wind and upwards when  moving against the wind.<br>
 If sound is moving faster at a height above the ground than at ground level, then the sound wave is bent towards the ground.<br>
 This refraction causes noise increase downwind and noise decrease upwind.<br>
 The noise of road traffic is greater if the wind is blowing in the direction of from the traffic towards you, and vice versa.<br>
 So the wind itself does not increase of decrease the speed of sound.<br>
 As acoustic waves moving in the direction of wind are refracted downwards,  audibility in the direction of the wind is increased.<br>
 A coastal foghorn may be heard a long way out to sea during offshore winds, but be heard only at a short distance during onshore  winds.<br>
 The noise of thunder may not be heard at a distance greater than 25 km causing "the calm before the storm".<br>
 However, another factor here is that the speed of sound is proportional  to the square root of temperature, so by Snell's law sound  waves are refracted upwards.<br>
 So given a typical lapse rate of 7.5 <sup>o</sup>K per km, from a height  of 4 km the maximum audibility is 25 km.<br>
 In aviation, windshear is a generic term referring to any rapidly changing  wind currents.<br>
 Local, short-lived downdrafts called "microbursts" radiate outward as they rush toward the ground from a cloud, creating an increasing  headwind over the wings of an aircraft.<br>
 This headwind causes a sudden leap in airspeed, so the aircraft lifts.<br>
 Inexperienced pilots are likely to react by reducing engine power.<br>
 However, as the plane passes through the shear, the wind quickly becomes  a downdraft and then a tailwind.<br>
 The extra lift and speed vanish so the aeroplane suddenly loses airspeed  and altitude, because it now flying on reduced power.<br>
 So the pilot must increase power to the engines to avoid a crash.<br>
 Many air accidents are caused by this phenomenon.<br>

 Place the large opening of the funnel over your heart or stomach and listen  in at the other end of the plastic tube.<br>
 See how many different body sounds you can identify from inside your body.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="26.6.13H">26.6.13</a> Sound waves travel through wood<br>
 To show that sound waves travel through wood, rest the ear against one end of a table top and gently tap the other end of the table  with a ruler or pencil.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="26.6.14H">26.6.14</a> Sound waves travels  along a wire fence<br>
 Divide into two groups and position yourselves as far apart as possible  along a wire fence so you can still see the other group.<br>
 Watch the other group strike the wire.<br>
 Time how long it takes for the sound to reach you in the air.<br>
 Now place you ear on the wire of the fence and listen and time it again.<br>
 If a long enough fence is not available listen to faint sounds travelling  through a table or other solid object.<br>
 You can hear sounds through the table that you may not hear through the  air since the sound is travelling faster and therefore does not  die out in as short a distance.<br>

<a href="../images/26.190.gif">See diagram 26.190</a>: Sound wave patterns.<br>
 The number of complete vibrations in one second is the frequency of a particular vibration.<br>
 The way in which different sound frequencies combine is analogous to water waves.<br>
 Ocean waves are longest, i.e. of low frequency.<br>
 Let a small motorboat pass over these waves.<br>
 The boat sends out its own waves, which have a higher frequency than ocean waves.<br>
 Wind will make tiny ripples across the surface of the motorboat waves.<br>
 The last ripples usually have an even higher frequency than the other two.<br>
 These three vibrations can combine to form a pattern.<br>

 Use hot wax to attach a piece of fine wire to the prong of a tuning fork.<br>
 Hold the fork rigidly by the handle and horizontally just above the table  top.<br>
 Use a candle to smoke a piece of glass.<br>
 Lay the smoked glass under the prong with the fine wire bent to touch the glass.<br>
 Start the tuning fork vibrations with the finger and move the glass along  the table fast enough to make a wavy line on it.<br>
 Repeat this experiment by moving the glass at different speeds and using  different tuning forks.<br>
 Note the markings on the tuning forks, e.g. "C", and compare the wave patterns.<br>

<a name="OscillationH">Oscillation</a><br>
 Oscillation is typically a swing to and fro in a regular rhythm, e.g. the swing of a pendulum, the "tick tock" of a clock, a part of a machine.<br>
 So during an oscillation a definite distance is covered by the movement about its equilibrium position.<br>
 However, "the oscillation" describes the movement of a body from its resting place to the maximum distance it can cover on one side to the maximum distance on the other side and back to its resting place.<br>
 That maximum distance is called the amplitude or maximum displacement.<br>
During oscillation the body takes a fixed time to complete one oscillation called periodic movement.<br>
The time taken to complete one oscillation is its frequency.<br>
 An oscillating electric current has periodic reversal of direction.<br>
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="VibrationH">Vibration</a><br>
Vibration of a body is the movement of the body about its mean position, as with oscillation, but the movement can be linear, circular, periodic or non periodic.<br>
So the movement of vibration can be in all directions, e.g. Vibration occurs when a string is plucked.<br>
Sound vibration is caused by a rapid alternation about an equilibrium position of the particles of an elastic body which is transmitted to air molecules.<br>
A vibration damper restricts or stops vibrations, e.g. in a piano, horn mute.<br>
Vibrating sources of sound produce a series of alternate compression and rarefaction that can travel as a longitudinal wave through a medium, e.g. air, water, wood, but not through a vacuum.<br>
The particles of the medium vibrate forwards and backwards in the same directions as the wave is travelling.<br>
For example, a loudspeaker cone vibrates forwards to produce a compression, "thicker air", and backwards to produce a rarefaction, "thinner air".<br>
<a name="SoundwaveH">Sound wave</a><br>
A sound wave is the mechanical wave motion when sound energy travels through a medium.<br>
Sound waves are compression waves in a material medium such as air, water, or steel.<br>
When the compression and rarefaction of the waves strike the eardrum, causing it to vibrate, which results in the sensation of sound, provided the frequency of the waves is between about 20 Hz and 20 000 Hz.<br>
 Waves with frequencies above 20 kHz are called ultrasonic waves.<br>
 Those with frequencies below 20 Hz are called infrasonic waves.<br>
 The word "sound" refers to the sensation when the eardrum reaction to vibrations.<br>
 Sound waves require vibration of the molecules or particles of their medium.<br>
 Sound is a longitudinal wave motion and will not pass through an evacuated space.<br>
 Sound travels as a wave in which motion the movement of the particles is transmitted, but not the physical particles themselves.<br>
 In a transverse wave the particles oscillate perpendicular to the direction  of the wave.<br>
 Sound waves are longitudinal waves so the particles oscillate parallel to the wave's direction of wave travel.<br>
Sound waves have a length, amplitude and frequency.<br>
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="WavelengtH">Wavelength</a><br>
Wavelength is the distance from one part of one wave to the same place on the next wave, e.g. the distance from the place of maximum compression to the next place of maximum compression.<br>
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="AmplitudeH"></a>Amplitude<br>
Amplitude is the difference between the pressure in the compression or the minimum pressure in the rarefaction and the pressure of the normal undisturbed air.<br>
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="FrequencyH"></a>Frequency<br>
Frequency refers to how often a rarefaction/compression pair pass a given point in a second, e.g. a tuning fork for the A above middle C vibrates 440 times every second or at 440 Hz.<br>
Frequency, f, is the number of compressions per second.<br>
The distance between compressions is the wavelength.<br>
Speed = frequency × wavelength.<br>
