<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="35.1.1H">35.1.1</a> Rocks<br>
 Rocks are any naturally occurring aggregate of one or more minerals and are classified by origin as follows:<br>
1. Igneous rock formed by volcanic activity,<br>
2. Sedimentary rock formed from sediments and,<br>
3. Metamorphic rock formed mainly by heat and pressure on original rock.<br>
Minerals were originally the substances obtained by mining, but, to a geologist, a mineral is a naturally occurring inorganic solid with a certain<br> 
chemical composition and physical properties, including an ordered internal structure.<br>
A mineral has a definite chemical composition and may have a characteristic shape.<br>
A rock is a composite of more than one mineral.<br>
Pieces of the same rock might be composed of different minerals.<br>
Some rocks are composed of elements, e.g. gold or silver, but most rocks are combinations of elements in minerals.<br>
For example, the mineral quartz is a combination of the elements silicon and oxygen, SiO2.<br>
Experiments<br> 
Use the following testing and descriptive techniques to identify minerals:<br>
Mineral classification<br>
| 1. Elements | 2. Sulfides (selenides, tellurides, arsenides, antimonides, bimuthides) | 3. Halides | 4. Oxides, hydroxides | 5. Nitrates, carbonates, borates<br>
 | 6. Sulfates (chromates, molybdates, wolframates) | 7. Phosphates, arsenates, vanadates | 8. Silicates | 9. Organic substances.<br>
Mineral origin:<br>
 | 1. Crystallization from magma, e.g. magnetite, mica, quartz | 2. Physical, chemical and biological changes caused by weathering, e.g. serpentine, malachite<br>
 | 3. Sedimentary and evaporation processes, e.g. rock salt, calcite | 4. Biological accumulation of salts, e.g. limestone, pyrite |.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="35.1.3H">35.1.3</a> Cleavage, fracture, twin crystals, crystal faces<br>
<a href="../images/35.9.0.gif">See diagram 35.9</a>: Cleavage.<br>
1. Cleavage is the tendency to split along certain definite planes.<br>
 It is a distinguishing property that reflects the crystalline structure of a mineral and which can be related to the packing together of its atomic constituents.<br>
Minerals may cleave in one, two, three or more directions with various degrees of perfection.<br>
A cleavage occurs when you can split a mineral in a plane parallel to a crystal face leaving a smooth flat surface along this planes.<br>
Some minerals have only one cleavage direction, e.g. mica, but other minerals may have two or more cleavages, e.g. galena has three cleavages.<br>
The direction of cleavage may be indicated by fine cleavage rifts running along the planes of cleavage.<br>
Some fine grain rocks have a cleavage, e.g. slate.<br>
2. Fracture is any breakage or rupture other than a cleavage.<br>
Some minerals break evenly, others have an uneven or jagged hackly fracture.<br>
The fracture may feel even, uneven, jagged and conchoidal.<br>
Conchoidal is the shell-like pattern seen on chipped glass.<br>
The fractures are curved as often in quartz.<br>
3. Twin crystals may occur in a regular way with internal angles consistently at more than 180 o , e.g. fluorite, gypsum, cassiterite.<br>
4. Crystal faces may have characteristic striations, e.g. pyrite, quartz, and tourmaline.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="35.1.4H">35.1.4</a> Colour of rocks and minerals<br>
The colour is an obvious physical property, but it varies too much to be a reliable property for identification.<br>
Rock colour charts are available, usually based on the "Munsell colour chart".<br>
The names of some colours come from the characteristic colour of minerals, e.g. emerald, ruby, azure, amethyst.<br>
Emerald, Be3Al2(SiO3)6, natural emerald<br>
Quartz, calcite and rock salt are colourless if they do not contain impurities.<br>
However, some pure minerals may have different colours, e.g. fluorspar, apatite and beryl.<br>
Colour of minerals may be changed by sunlight, artificial light, ultraviolet light, turning in the light, radioactivity, surface tarnish, heat, and dyes.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="35.1.5H">35.1.5</a> Crystal systems, crystal habit, crystal form<br>
<a href="../images/35.8.1.gif">See diagram 35.8.1</a>: Orthogonal axes.<br>
<a href="../images/35.8.2.gif">See diagram 35.8.2</a>: Non-orthogonal axes.<br>
<a href="../images/35.8.3.gif">See diagram 35.8.3</a>: Crystal habit.<br>
<a href="../images/35.8.4.gif">See diagram 35.8 4</a>: Crystal form of the seven crystal systems.<br>
Most minerals are crystalline, but some minerals are amorphous, non-crystalline.<br>
The patterns of the internal atomic structures result in a definite external shape.<br>
However, silica, SiO2, may occur as quartz crystals, irregular sand grain crystals, fine grain chalcedony aggregate, and amorphous opal deposit.<br>
Crystal habit<br>
Crystal habit refers to the relative width and length of the crystal faces, i.e. the development of the faces of a crystal.<br>
Crystal habits: | pyramidal habit, e.g. native sulfur | columnar habit, e.g. calcite, tourmaline, gypsum | tabular habit (flat slab), e.g. mica | acicular habit<br>
 (needle-like), e.g. malachite, gypsum, rutile | fibrous habit, e.g. asbestiform fibrous hydrated silicate minerals are hazardous in the air | lamellar habit<br>
 (plate-like), e.g. muscovite, biotite, chlorite | prismatic habit (elongated), e.g. most silicates, hornblende |.<br>
A similar term, "crystal form", refers to the geometric shape of the crystal.<br>
When looking at a crystal:<br>
| "axis a" is "front to back" | "axis b" is "right to left", and | "axis c" is "top to bottom"|.<br>
 Orthogonal axes are mutually at right angles, i.e. the cubic, tetragonal, and orthorhombic (rhombic) crystal systems.<br>
 Non-orthogonal axes have one or more axes not at right angles to the others, i.e. the monoclinic and triclinic crystal systems.<br>
 The hexagonal and trigonal crystal systems have three horizontal axes mutually at 120 o and at right angles to the vertical, axis c.<br>
 Let α = angle between axis b and axis c, β = angle between axis a and axis c, and γ = angle between axis a and axis b.<br>
The seven crystal systems and examples of crystal form, (geometric shape of the crystal):<br>
1. Cubic (isometric): a = b = c, and α = β = γ = 90 o , e.g. galena, garnet, halite, fluorite, magnetite, pyrite, sphalerite, uraninite<br>
2. Tetragonal: a = b not = c, and α = β = γ = 90 o , e.g. cassiterite, chalcopyrite, rutile, scheelite, zircon<br>
3. Orthorhombic: a not = b not = c, and α = β = γ = 90 o , e.g. barytes, marcasite, olivine, stibnite, sulfur<br>
4. Monoclinic: a not = b not = c, and α = γ = 90 o not = beta, e.g. augite, gypsum, hornblende, micas, orthoclase feldspar, serpentine, talc<br>
5. Triclinic: a = b = c, and α not = β not = γ e.g. axinite, plagioclase feldspar, rhodonite<br>
6. Hexagonal: a = b not = c, and α = β = γ = 90 o , e.g. apatite, beryl<br>
7. Trigonal: a = b not = c, and α = β = γ not = 90 o , e.g. ilmenite, tourmaline.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="35.1.6H">35.1.6</a> Feel and conductivity<br>
Experienced handlers of minerals, e.g. gemstone workers, claim to be able to recognize minerals from the feel against the fingers or the cheek.<br>
For example talc and graphite may feel smooth and greasy, while, (China clay), and chalk feel rough and dry.<br>
Copper feels colder than amber against the cheek, because copper is a better conductor of heat.<br>
Similarly, real gemstones can be distinguished from glass imitations by feel against the cheek.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="35.1.7H">35.1.7</a> Grain size and roundness<br>
Measure size and roundness with a sand gauge.<br>
Size classification systems include the logarithmic "Wentworth scale" and the "USCS scale" (United Soil Classification System).<br>
Grain sizes:<br>
| boulder &gt; 256 mm | cobble 64 to 256 mm | pebble 4 to 64 mm | gravel (granule) 2 to 4 mm | sand 1/16 to 2 mm | silt 1/256 to 1/16 mm | clay &lt; 1/256 mm |.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="35.1.8H">35.1.8</a> Hydrochloric acid test, effervescence test<br>
Cold, dilute hydrochloric acid causes bubbles, effervescence, with sedimentary rocks containing carbonates, i.e. limestone.<br>
For example. calcite CaCO3, dolomite Ca(CO3).Mg(CO3), witherite BaCO3, malachite CuCO3Cu(OH)2.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="35.1.9H">35.1.9</a> Lustre (metallic lustre, non-metallic lustre)<br>
The lustre is the appearance of the surface of a mineral in reflected light, depending on the reflection and refraction of light.<br>
The lustre often distinguishes minerals from one another.<br>
Minerals are divided into two great groups on the basis of their lustre.<br>
One group is opaque and has a metallic lustre like that of a metal.<br>
The other group may be opaque or transparent, but does not have a metallic lustre.<br>
Most of the ore minerals have a metallic or a sub-metallic lustre, but others may be vitreous or glassy; resinous (like resin), pearly or silky.<br>
Minerals may be:<br>
1. opaque and with a metallic lustre, like a metal, e.g. pyrite, galena,<br>
2. opaque or transparent, but without a metallic lustre.<br>
Subdivided as: | adamantine (diamond-like) lustre | vitreous (glassy) lustre | greasy (oily) lustre | dull lustre | silky lustre, e.g. asbestos | pearly lustre (layered) |.<br>
A gem with changeable lustre, chatoyancy, is called a cat's eye, e.g. chrysoberyl, a form of quartz.<br>
The lustre of a diamond used in jewellery is called its "water", so jewellers call the best diamonds "the diamonds of the first water".<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="35.1.10H">35.1.10</a> Magnetism test<br>
Note whether the powdered mineral is strongly or weakly attracted to a magnet, e.g. magnetite Fe3O4, attracts iron dust.<br>
Haematite becomes magnetic when heated.<br>
Palaeomagnetism is the study of the magnetic record in ancient rocks, e.g. changes and reversals in ancient magnetic fields of the Earth.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="35.1.11H">35.1.11</a> Odour and taste<br>
Some minerals have a characteristic odour when rubbed, e.g. arsenopyrite FeAsS, fluorite.<br>
Sulfur has a distinctive odour, clay minerals have an "earthy" smell.<br>
Minerals soluble in water have a characteristic taste.<br>
Some people claim that the amalgam fillings in their teeth allow them to taste certain minerals.<br>
A "metallic taste" in the mouth may be caused by antibiotics, drugs, oral diseases and even mercury poisoning.<br>
Usually the metallic taste disappears within days.<br>
Some common examples of odour and taste include the following:
Chalcanthite, sweet metallic taste and slightly poisonous, CuSO4.5H2O, it is a water-soluble sulfate,<br>
Epsomite, Epsom salts, bitter taste, MgSO4.7H2O, hydrated magnesium sulfate,<br>
Glauberite, bitter and salty taste, Na2Ca(SO4)2, sodium calcium sulfate,<br>
Halite, rock salt, saline taste, NaCl,<br>
Hanksite, salty taste, Na22K(SO4)9(CO3)2, sodium potassium sulfate carbonate.<br>
Melanterite, sweet, astringent and metallic taste, FeSO4.7H2O, hydrated iron sulfate.<br>
Sylvite (sylvine) bitter taste, KCl.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="35.1.12H">35.1.12</a> Relative density, minerals, RD (formerly S.G. )<br>
The relative density, RD, of a mineral is a number that expresses the ratio between its mass and the mass of an equal volume of water at 4 o C.<br>
If a mineral has a relative density of 2, it means that a given specimen of that mineral has twice as much mass as the same volume of water.<br>
Most common minerals have a relative density of 2.5 to 4.0.<br>
The following substances have their densities expressed in g / cm 3 : | sulfur 2.0 | quartz 2.6 | calcite 2.7 | copper 8.9 | lead: 11.35 |.<br>
Some ores are not uniform in density, because they contain variable quantities of quartz, feldspar and other minerals, e.g. malachite, cassiterite and cerussite.<br>
Minerals less than 2.5, feel "light" and those more than 3.0, feel "heavy" for their relative size.<br>
The relative density of a mineral of fixed composition is constant and its determination is frequently an important aid in identification of the mineral.<br>
To find the relative density of a mineral, it must be pure and compact, with no cracks or cavities where bubbles or films of air can exist.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="35.1.13H">35.1.13</a> Shape or form<br>
Minerals may be found in a number of different shapes.<br>
They may be crystals, parts of crystals or groups of crystals, which may be just massive or grouped haphazardly or in a particular way.<br>
If the crystals radiate from a point we may call them radiating.<br>
They may form networks or be reticulated.<br>
Tree-like or moss-like shapes are described as mossy or dentritic.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="35.1.14H">35.1.14</a> Streak<br>
The streak refers to the colour of the ground or powdered mineral and is sometimes a reliable test.<br>
To see the streak, rub the mineral on a ceramic streak plate or building tile or unglazed porcelain to leave a coloured scratch.<br>
Porcelain has Mohs scale hardness 6-6.5, so harder minerals will only leave a streak of white porcelain powder.<br>
Grind the harder minerals to see the streak colour.<br>
The colour of the streak may be different from the colour of the gross mineral in the ground.<br>
Colourless and white minerals always have white streak.<br>
Minerals with metallic lustre show the difference between true colour of the mineral and streak colour, e.g. black haematite gives a red streak powder.<br>
A mineral usually has a constant streak colour, even if the colour of the mineral varies.<br>
So streak is much more reliable quality than colour of the mineral.<br>
The iron mineral haematite gives a brick red streak and limonite gives a yellow streak.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="35.1.15H">35.1.15</a> Tenacity<br>
Most minerals are brittle.<br>
Minerals may be as follows:<br>
| sectile (cut easily with a knife),<br>
| malleable (be flattened out under a hammer),<br>
| flexible (be bent without breaking,<br>
| elastic (natural shape after expansion, contraction or distortion) |.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="35.1.16H">35.1.16</a> Touchstone, gold streak<br>
Touchstone is a schist, used to assay gold by comparing the streak of the sample to the streak of "touch needles" with known gold content.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="35.1.17H">35.1.17</a> Transparency (transparent, translucent, opaque, refraction)<br>
Transparent minerals allow passage of light without much deviation or absorption, like window glass.<br>
You can read through a transparent mineral, e.g. quartz (rock crystal), rock salt, topaz.<br>
Each transparent mineral has a characteristic refractive index.<br>
Translucent minerals allow passage of some light, but not images, e.g. frosted glass used in bathrooms.<br>
Translucent minerals may be a transparent mineral containing impurities or finely granular transparent minerals.<br>
The minerals gypsum and mica may be translucent or opaque if finely granular, but transparent if big crystals.<br>
Opaque minerals allow no passage of light in thin section and have a metallic or dull lustre, e.g. pyrite.<br>
An anisotrtopic crystal may split incident light to produce double refraction, e.g. calcite crystal.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="35.2.1H">35.2.1</a> Actinolite<br>
Actinolite, Ca2(Mg Fe)Si8O22(OH)2 is a similar mineral to Hornblende.<br>

 A rare gemstone, found in Alberta and on slopes of Rocky Mountains, composed of fossilized shells of ammonites, aragonite crystals as in nacreous pearl shell.<br>
Pearly flashes of red, green and blue iridescence from polished ammolite is caused by interference of light rebounding through layers of aragonite.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="35.2.4H">35.2.4</a> Asbestos<br>
1. Asbestos is a group of fibrous silicate minerals, compact and hard, resembled petrified root of a tree, so called "mountain flax" or "salamander's wool".<br>
asbestos (Greek <i>amiantos</i> incombustible)<br>
Colours range from brown to yellow to green.<br>
It usually occurs mixed with serpentine rock or mica schist.<br>
Tiger's Eye and Hawk's Eye, used for men's cufflinks, are altered varieties of asbestos with wavy bands of light that glow and ripple as you move them.<br>
 Asbestos is a fireproof substance and formerly was widely used as a heat insulator, for packing and for fireproof garments and fabrics.<br>
The main asbestos mineral is white asbestos or chrysotile, hydrous magnesium silicate, Mg3Si2O5(OH)4, in the serpentine mineral group.<br>
Blue asbestos, crocidolite, is the most lethal to humans.<br>
2. Inhalation of the short asbestos fibres can cause the lung disorder asbestosis, mesothelioma lung cancer and bronchiogenic cancer.<br>
The manufacture and use of white chrysotile asbestos products, is banned in Australia in 2003, and since then is banned in many countries.<br>
<a name="FibroH"><i>Fibro</i></a>, abbreviation for “fibrous cement sheet”, a fibrous material, commonly containing asbestos to reinforce thin cement sheets.<br>
The most common types of fibro are flat sheets used for ceilings and walls, and corrugated sheets used for ceilings.<br>
In Australia, the use of asbestos in fibro was phased out during the 1980s, and stopped entirely by 1987.<br> 
"Fibro" is a type of “bonded” asbestos, so there is no danger of asbestos fibres being released into the atmosphere.<br>
However, general weathering, hail damage, fire damage, drilled fibro can make the asbestos “friable”, i.e. it can be breathed in.<br>
Asbestos fibres may cause severe respiratory illnesses, mesothelioma, and lung cancer.<br>
In Australia, asbestos can be tested and removed only by a licensed asbestos removal contractor.<br>
Do not cut old "fibro" sheets or pieces of asbestos, but replace the whole sheets with non-asbestos sheets.<br>
3. Asbestos is extremely toxic if inhaled into the lungs and causes two cancers, bronchiogenic carcinoma and mesothelioma.<br>
It is safe to touch, but do not inhale the fibres.<br>
Other forms of asbestos (amosite, anthophyllite, tremolite, actinolite and chrysotile) are not as dangerous by inhalation as crocidolite, but treat them similarly.<br>
Specimens of ash should be stored in a sealed container until collection by a licensed waste contractor.<br>
Correctly embedded asbestos, as in geology teaching sample sets, does not pose a threat to health, provided that the embedding material remains intact.<br>
4. In Queensland, Australia, asbestos samples sealed in plastic bags were in school minerals sets, but students opened the plastic bags and handled the asbestos.<br>
The Queensland Government was forced to take out the asbestos samples from the school mineral sets.<br>
Crocidolite asbestos is Not permitted in schools, so store demonstration specimens in sealed containers or embedded in plastic.<br>
5. Classification of asbestos<br>
Chrysotile, Mg3Si2O5(OH)4, white asbestos, most common use, in roofs, ceilings, walls, floors of homes, automobile brake linings, pipe insulation.<br>
Amosite, (Mg,Fe)7(OH,Si4O11), brown asbestos, used in cement sheets, pipe insulation, insulating board, ceiling tiles.<br>
Crocidolite, Na2Fe3Fe2[(OH, F)Si4O11]2, blue asbestos, tiger's eye, cat's eye, most lethal to humans, used to insulate steam engines, spray-on coatings.<br>
Anthophyllite, (Mg,Fe)7(OH, Si4,O11)2, used for insulation products and construction materials, contaminant in chrysotile asbestos, vermiculite and talc.<br>
Tremolite, Ca2Mg5(OH, F)2(Si4,O11)2, not used commercially, contaminants in chrysotile asbestos, vermiculite and talc.<br>
Actinolite, Ca2(Mg, Fe2)5(Si8,O22)(OH,F)2, not used commercially, powdered mineral herbal medicine.<br>

Feldspars occur as aluminosilicates of alkali metals and alkaline earths, have pink colour, but red-green or yellow colour if impure and some are white.<br> 
For example, albite, NaAlSi3O8, Mohs scale of hardness 6, white streak, glassy lustre, good cleavage in two directions, conchoidal fracture, SG 2.55-2.76.<br>
Aluminosilicates are the most common rock forming silicate in igneous rocks and some sedimentary rocks.<br>
Feldspars are used in the interior of buildings as an ornamental veneer.<br>
Feldspars have dull surfaces, unless light strikes at just the right angle.<br>
Feldspars in rocks may cause flashes of light, because of reflection from two directions of cleavage at right angles to each other.<br>
Feldspars are used in glazes and the manufacture of glass, enamels, polishes, and roofing material.<br>
Feldspars are divided into two groups:<br>

 Halite has a characteristic sharp taste.<br>
 The inland salt trade was once important for many places, e.g. Salzburg.<br>
 Table salt is always snowy white, but natural salt has many different colours, because of impurities.<br>
 A red colour is caused by ferric oxide (iron oxide), grey is caused by clay, and brown is caused by plant matter.<br>
 Used as table salt, road salt and glass manufacture.<br>
 In the Bible, Matthew 5: 13, "Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted?<br>
 It is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men."<br>
 Although pure sodium chloride cannot lose its saltiness, the rock salt used in biblical times often contained impurities.<br>
 If the sodium chloride content was leached away or lost by evaporation in very hot countries, the "salt" could indeed lose its salty taste.<br>
 Fine grain salt may taste saltier than coarse grain salt because of greater surface to volume ratio, so that more salt dissolve in saliva to reach the taste receptors<br>
 The evaporates from sea water salt pans are not pure sodium chloride.<br>
 They may contain over 10% magnesium chloride which acts as a desiccating agent and assists food preservation.<br>

 Fragments of magnetite will be attracted to a magnet or will affect a suspended magnetic needle.<br>
 Magnetite has about 73% iron, but it may also contain magnesium, chromium and titanium.<br>
 Magnetite is widely distributed in igneous rocks and volcanic ashes so it is an important iron ore used in smelting.<br>
 Magnetite is a folk medicine for liver function and a sedative.<br>
Magnetism<br>
The magnetism of metals and other materials are determined by the orbital and spin motions of the unpaired electrons.<br>
Ferromagnetic - spins are aligned parallel in magnetic domains - strong magnetism.<br>
Ferrimagnetic - spinss are aligned antiparallel, but do not cancel - weak magnetism.<br>
