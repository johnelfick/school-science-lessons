<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.146H"></a>4.146 Balance with a metre stick, 
stationary meeting point, centre of mass, centre of gravity<br>
<a href="../images/8.146.gif">See diagram 8.146</a>: Stationary meeting point.<br>
<a href="../images/4.146.gif">See diagram 4.146</a>: Uniform rod.<br>
<a href="../images/4.146.1.gif">See diagram 4.146.1</a>: Metre stick.<br>
 A body acts as if its mass is concentrated at a single point, the centre 
 of mass.<br>
 Gravity acts through the same point, the centre of gravity.<br>
 If a vertical line through the centre of gravity of an object does not 
pass through its base, the object falls over.<br>
 An object, e.g. a motor car, will not roll over easily if it has a low 
centre of gravity and a wide base.<br>
 The centre of gravity of a metre stick or uniform rod is in the centre.<br>
If two fingers support the rod and one finger moves towards the centre of gravity the rod begins to tip towards that finger to increase the weight and increase the force of friction.<br>
 The other finger feels less weight and has less friction so the rod easily
slides above it.<br>
Experiments<br>
1. Support a metre stick or uniform rod over your
 two index fingers so that each finger is exactly 1 cm from the end.<br>
 The weight on the fingers feels exactly the same.<br>
 Keep the left finger in place, but slowly move the right finger towards 
the centre until it is half way between the centre and the end.<br>
 The metre stick feels heavier on the right finger than on the left finger.<br>
 Move the fingers together while keeping the metre stick balanced.<br>
 As your left finger moves towards the right finger, the metre stick feels
heavier on it.<br>
 The weight on each finger feels about the same when the two fingers move
together to be just each side of the centre of gravity.<br>
2. Repeat the experiment by moving one finger quickly
 and the other finger slowly.<br>
 Maintain the ruler in balance while moving the fingers.<br>
 If the metre stick remains horizontal, the two fingers always meet at 
the centre of the metre stick.<br>
3. Repeat the experiment using two round smooth
 pencils on a level table instead of fingers.<br>
 Move the right pencil towards the middle of the rod while holding the 
left pencil in place.<br>
 As the right pencil approaches the middle of the rod the pencils have 
the same distance to the ends of the rod.<br>
4. Repeat the experiment by hanging your hat on one end of the metre stick.<br>
Note the new position of the centre of gravity.<br>
5. Repeat the experiment with a broom to find its centre of gravity.<br>
6. Slide two kitchen scales under a loaded beam.<br>
 Note the scale readings of the moving and stationary scales change in 
the same way that your fingers feel change in weight under the 
 metre stick.<br>
7. Put an empty drink-can on a rough wooden board.<br>
 Raise one end of the board until the drink-can falls over.<br>
 At that angle, a vertical line through the centre of gravity of the drink-can
passes outside its base.<br>
8. Stand still then raise your right arm sideways.<br>
 Nothing happens.<br>
 Raise your right leg sideways.<br>
 If your upper body moves to the left, your centre of gravity remains 
over your left foot so you remain stable.<br>
 If you keep your upper body rigid, your centre of gravity moves to the 
right and is no longer over your left foot, so you fall over.<br>

If the angle of an inclined plane = a, then the component of the weight perpendicular to the inclined plane = W cos a, is balanced by the normal reaction of the plane.<br>
 The component of the weight that would cause the object to accelerate 
down the inclined plane, if no friction = W sin a, or (W sin a - force of friction).<br>

Taking the "support" board away from the suspended block reveals a force 
vector equilibrium.<br>
 The sides of the triangle are in the ration of 3: 4: 5.<br>
 The 1500g block rests on a stop which can be removed after the force parallel

<a href="../images/18.4.2.0.gif">See diagram 18.4.2.0</a>: Moments.<br>
1. The moment of a force about a point = force × perpendicular distance from the point to the line of action of the force.<br>
The moment of a force about an axis = component of the force in a plane at right angles to the axis × perpendicular distance to the axis from the line of action of the component.<br>
2. The size and direction of the resultant, R, for two like parallel forces, P and Q = P + Q, passing through point O between P and Q, where P × AO = Q × OB.<br>
3. The size and direction of the resultant, R, for two unlike parallel forces, P and Q = P - Q, passing in the direction of the greater of the forces through point O beyond the greater force where P × AO = Q ×OB.<br>
4. A couple refers to the application of two equal and opposite forces to cause rotation, e.g. pushing on the handle bars of a bicycle to change its direction.<br>
The moment of a couple, i.e. the torque = the product of one of the forces and the perpendicular distance between the line of action of the forces.<br>

<a href="../images/18.4.2.01m.gif">See diagram 18.4.2.01</a>: Torque beam 2.<br>
 A torque is a twisting or rotating force, the moment of a system of forces
causing rotation or changing the speed of rotation.<br>
 A torque wrench is a tool for setting and adjusting the tension of nut 
and bolts so that they are not too loose and not too tight.<br>
 A torque converter in the automatic transmission system in a motor vehicle 
 changes the torque in the engine.<br>
A couple consist of two equal and opposite parallel forces that have a turning effect, moment, called a torque = one of the forces × perpendicular distance between their lines of action.<br>
 The turning effect is about an axis that is normal to the plane of the 
forces.<br>
 The SI unit for the torque of the couple is newton metre.<br>
 (A torque converter in an automatic transmission system of a motor vehicle 
 varies or multiplies torque.)<br>
 1. Different combinations of mass at different distances from the pivot 
 can be used to show torques in equilibrium.<br>
 Distances from the pivot are integer multiples: r, 2r, 3r, 4r. Individual 
 masses are identical.<br>
 2. To show different torque in equilibrium, use different combinations 
of masses at different distances from a pivot.<br>
3. A uniform rod mass 500g and length 120 cm is supported horizontally by two vertical strings, T1 at one end A, and T2 at 30 cm from the other end B.<br>
What is the tensions in the strings when a mass of 200 g hangs from end B? (see diagram).<br>
 4. Use a torque wrench to break aluminium and steel bolts.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="18.4.2.1H"></a>18.4.2.1 Beam balance, moments, parallel forces in equilibrium<br>
<a href="../images/16.13.gif">See diagram: 16.13</a>: Beam balance.<br>
 The moment of a force is a measure of the turning effect, or torque, produced by the force acting on an object.<br>
 It is equal to the product of the force and the perpendicular distance from its line of action to the point, or pivot, about which the object will turn.<br>
Its SI unit is the newton metre (Nm) If the magnitude of the force is F newton and the perpendicular distance is d metres then the moment is given by: moment = Fd.<br>

<a href="../images/4.145x.gif">See diagram 4.145</a>: Balance with a see-saw.<br>
M1 moments anticlockwise, M2 moments clockwise.<br>
 1. Use a strong board 3 m long and a saw horse to make a see-saw, or use
a playground see-saw.<br>
 Select two students of similar weight.<br>
 Tell them to sit at either end of the board so that they balance and the
see-saw is horizontal.<br>
 Measure the distance from the balance point, the fulcrum, to each student.<br>
 They are similar distances from the fulcrum.<br>
 For each student, calculate the moment by multiplying the distance rom 
the fulcrum by the student's weight.<br>
 The moments clockwise should equal the moments anticlockwise.<br>
 Select a heavier student and a lighter student and repeat the experiment.<br>
 Tell them to sit on the board so that they balance.<br>
 Measure the distance from the balance point to each student.<br>
 Multiply the distance by the student's weight to calculate the moments 
clockwise and moments anticlockwise.<br>
 For objects in equilibrium the moment in one direction is equal to the 
moment in the opposite direction.<br>
 2.1 Make a see-saw with 3 m board and a sawhorse for a fulcrum.<br>
 Use two students of equal weight.<br>
 Sit at either end of the board so that they balance.<br>
 Measure the distance from the fulcrum, balance point, to each student.<br>
 Multiply the distance by the weight of the student.<br>
 2.2 Select a heavier student and a lighter student.<br>
 Tell them to sit on the board so that they balance.<br>
 Measure the distance from the fulcrum to each student.<br>
 Multiply the distance by the student's weight.<br>
 2.3 Select a heavier student, weight m<sub>1</sub>, and a lighter student, 
 weight m<sub>2</sub>.<br>
 Sit on the board so that they balance.<br>
 Measure the distance from the fulcrum to each student, d<sub>1</sub> 
and d<sub>2</sub>.<br>
 Multiply the distance by the student's weight.<br>
 You will discover that m<sub>1</sub>d<sub>1 </sub>= m<sub>2</sub>d<sub>2</sub>.<br>
 2.4 Select a heavier student, weight m<sub>1</sub>, and two lighter students, 
weight m<sub>2 </sub>and m<sub>2</sub>.br>
 Sit on the board so that they balance.<br>
 Measure the distance from the fulcrum to each student.<br>
 Multiply the distance by the student's weight.<br>
 Add the products for the two lighter students.<br>
 m<sub>1</sub>d<sub>1</sub> = m<sub>2</sub>d<sub>2. </sub>m<sub>1</sub>d<sub>1</sub> 
 = m<sub>2</sub>d<sub>2</sub> + m<sub>3</sub>d<sub>3</sub>.<br>

 2. Use a metre stick suspended at the centre as a torque balance.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="18.4.2.7H"></a>18.4.2.7 Tightrope walking<br>
 Compare how much easier it is to balance a metre stick over the finger
 compare to a 10 cm ruler.<br>
 The reason is the difference in inertia of the two rules.<br>
 A tightrope walker may carry a long stick, often with a weight attached 
 to each end to increase inertia.<br>
 Moment of inertia, I = mr<sup>2</sup>, where m = mass and r = distance.<br>
 The masses further away from the centre are harder to move.<br>
 So any deviations from the balanced equilibrium position happen slowly
 and give the tightrope walker ample time for correction.<br>

If two spheres have same diameter and mass, but different densities of their material such that one sphere is solid and the other sphere is hollow, the hollow sphere rolls more slowly down a slope, because all of its mass is at a distance from the centre of the sphere.<br>

 rotational motion<br>
 Rotational motion refers to a situation when a rigid body is rotating 
about a fixed axis.<br>
 The average angular velocity of the body, ω<sub>av</sub> = <font
 size="3" face="TimesH">θ</font>t radians per second, where <font
 size="3" face="TimesH">θ</font> is the angle turned, i.e. the angular displacement, 
 during the time t.<br>
 So for one revolution at constant angular velocity, ω, the angle turned 
 = 2<font size="3" face="TimesH">π</font> radians during the time period, T.<br>
 So angular velocity, ω = 2 <font size="3" face="TimesH">π</font>T radians 
 per second.<br>
 The average angular acceleration, <font size="3" face="TimesH">α<sub>av</sub></font> 
 = change in angular velocity.<br>
 Time taken = (ω<sub>f</sub> - ω<sub>i</sub>)t radians per second<sup>2</sup>, 
 where ω<sub>f</sub> = final angular velocity and ω<sub>i</sub> = initial 
 angular velocity.<br>

An ice skater can start a spin on one toe with one leg extended and both arms extended (I is large and ω is small), but when the ice skater brings both legs and both arms together (now I is small and ω is large), the moment of inertia decreases and speed of spin increases, the skater spins much faster due to conservation of angular momentum.<br>

 The speed of an object at the bottom of a slope depends on its moment

 The Watts centrifugal governor has two heavy balls connected via pinions

 Turn the handle to fling out the balls caused by centrifugal forces.<br>
 The balls are attached via linkage arms and a spring to a collar on the
rotating axle.<br>
 This collar is connected via some mechanism to the input of the engine 
controlling the rotation of the axle to constitute a feedback 
 control mechanism.<br>
 The governor can be used in the motor control gear for the lifts.<br>
 3. Engines supplying motive power usually have to run at a fairly constant 
 speed.<br>
 This is managed by means of a governor, which controls the supply of steam, 
gas, or oil, by opening or closing a valve.<br>
 The governor usually consists of two revolving balls mounted on two arms
attached to a shaft driven by the engine.<br>
 The balls move out to a larger radius of rotation if the speed increases, 
 and move inwards if the speed falls, and this movement controls 
 the supply valve.<br>
 The forces acting on one of the balls are its weight, W, the pull of the
arm, T, and centrifugal force, P.<br>
 If the ball is rotating at a steady speed it will keep at a constant radius
from the axis, and P, W and T will balance.<br>

Experiments<br>
 1. A body is free to rotate about three mutually perpendicular axes.<br>
 If when rotating about one axis (axis of spin) a torque is applied about 
 another axis (axis of torque), the body will rotate about the third axis (axis of precession).<br>
Use the right hand rule (thumb, first and second finger mutually at right angles), where first finger represents axis of spin, second finger represents axis of torque and thumb represents axis of precession.<br>
2. Angular velocity of precession from formula L = Ι, where L = torque about the axis of torque, Ι (upper case iota) = moment of inertia about the axis of spin (lower case omega) = angular velocity of spin (upper case omega) = angular velocity of precession.<br>
3. A bicycle wheel weighted with lead on its rim 
 is spun by a motorized wheel spinner and supported by a wire connected 
to a protruding axle.<br>
 The gravitational torque causes precession of the wheel.<br>
 Give the spinning bicycle wheel is handed to a student seated on a stool.<br>
 When the student raises the spinning wheel overhead, the student rotates 
 through 90<sup>o</sup>.<br>
 When the student lowers the wheel to its original position, the student 
 rotates in the other direction.<br>
4. An electrically driven gyroscope may be mounted 
 so that weights may be added to the protruding axles.<br>
 If equal weights are placed equidistant from the rotating mass, no precession 
 occurs.<br>
 When an unbalanced torque exists, the gyroscope rotates perpendicular 
to both the rotation axis and the couple axis.<br>
5. A car you are driving has a flywheel revolving 
 in an anticlockwise direction with reference to you.<br>
 When you turn a corner to your right you are applying a torque to turn 
the flywheel about a clockwise axis (looking down on the 
 flywheel).<br>
The axis of spin is away from you, the axis of torque is vertically up and the flywheel precesses, so that the axis of spin follows the axis of torque<br>
with the top of the flywheel tending to move towards you and the bottom of the flywheel tending to move away from you.<br>
 So during the right hand turn the axis of precession is anticlockwise 
to the left horizontally.<br>
6. A gyroscope is a spinning wheel or disc that spins around it axis where the direction of rotation remains the same and the direction of spin remains<br>
the same.<br>
 The gyroscope is mounted in two rings, gimbals that allow the axis of 
spin to remain opined in the same direction matter how the gyroscope is held.<br>
 The gyroscope will resist movement in direction of the input axis or output axis, but remain spinning at right angles to the spin axis.<br>
7. The pull of gravity on the gyroscope is countered by the force of precession, i.e. the tendency of spinning bodies to move at right angles to a force that tends to change its direction of rotation.<br>
8. A gyroscope can be used in navigation, because it resisted changes in its direction of rotation so it can show the direction of movement compared to the original direction of movement when first set spinning.<br>
So a gyro compass shows the direction of north not by using terrestrial magnetism, but because it was originally set to point true north before the start of the journey.<br>

<a href="../images/18.3.5.1.gif">See diagram 18.3.5.1</a>: Boomerang.<br>
 As the boomerang flies in the air, it does two movements, a spinning motion and a general forward motion.<br>
The spinning produces two effects, on one hand the angular momentum of spinning should be maintained unchanging, so the speed and plane of spinning are all unchanging; on the other hand spinning changes the direction of the flying boomerang, i.e. the boomerang does not fly in a straight line, but a curved line.<br>
 When the boomerang moves to the farthest point, its momentum has used up and it will drop acted by the gravity.<br>
 However, as the spinning of the boomerang, the line that the boomerang goes will also a curved line, return to the man who threw it at first.<br>
Experiments<br>
1. Draw a boomerang on the cardboard in the shape and cut it off.<br>
 Hold the centre of the boomerang.<br>
 Bend two wings gently to make wings slightly turn upward.<br>
Hold the edge in the centre of the boomerang between index finger and thumb of your left hand, flick it away with the middle finger of your right hand to make it fly inclined upward.<br>
The boomerang will fly along a arc line and return by itself.<br>
2. Look at the different types of boomerangs in terms of the forces acting on them and how they change the motion.<br>
Give each student a wooden craft-cut boomerang and sandpaper of different grades.<br>
Tell the students to alter the shape of the boomerang and test it to see if they can get it to return to them.<br>
If they add Blu Tak adhesive to the mix the students can observer at the effect of centre of mass.<br>
The students should do the throwing tests on a sports oval in a clearly-delineated launch area.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="18.3.5.2H"></a>18.3.5.2 Precession, spinning
 top, precessing ball, precession of the equinoxes<br>
 Precession is the rotation of the axis of a spinning body about another 
 axis, caused by a torque acting to change the direction of the first axis.<br>
 This motion is like the movement of the Earth's axis in the precession 
of the equinoxes.<br>
 The regular motion of the inclined axis of the spinning top around the 
vertical is an example of precession.<br>
 Spin a child's spinning toy top and note how the axis of the top gradually 
 moves in a circle, because of precession.<br>
 When the spinning of the top slows, the circle of the precession increases, 
 until the top wobbles and falls over.<br>
 Some children can whip a spinning top to increase the velocity of spin 
and decrease the circle of precession until the axis is almost 
 vertical.<br>
 A spinning top has gyroscopic inertia in that it stays spinning on its 
axis at the same angle, and so it is difficult to push it over.<br>

A gimbals mount is a bearing for supporting an object to keep a horizontal position allowing for rotation about 2 perpendicular axes, e.g. nautical compass, gyroscope, chronometer used on a ship.<br>
 A gyroscope in gimbals is deprived of one degree of freedom A slight change
of direction will cause a spin flip.<br>

 anti-roll stabilizers<br>
<a href="../images/18.3.5.6.gif">See diagram 18.3.5.6</a>: Ship with stabilizers.<br>
 Most ships, especially passenger ships, are fitted with two stabilizers 
 about 5 m long on each side of the ship.<br>
They are retractable and are normally housed in compartments below the hull when the ship is in narrow waters or in port, or when sea conditions are calm.<br>
 The stabilizers direct the flow of water to create lift in a similar manner
to aeroplanes.<br>
 The created lift can counteract 90% of the rolling motion of the ship.<br>
 The fin angle of the stabilizers is adjusted automatically by a system 
linked to a gyroscope to detect the motion of the ship.<br>
 The first ships stabilizers were fitted in the 1930s by the Denny-Brown 
 shipbuilding company.<br>
 However, although stabilizers can counteract roll, they can do little 
or nothing to counteract lift, the fore-aft motion of ships.<br>
So even the largest passenger ships in the world, e.g. Queen Mary II, will lift and drop when directed into a swell with little or no counteraction<br>
from the stabilizers.<br>
Some passengers have claimed that during a storm the captain of a passenger ship has retracted the ship's stabilizers to avoid damage from the stormy conditions.<br>
 Ships stabilizers, gyrostabilizers, in a passenger ship, are adjusted 
to make the ship float in a more upright position and counteract the 
 rolling motion.<br>
 They consist of fins mounted on each side of the ships and controlled 
by a motor-driven gyroscope.<br>
 The fins can be adjusted by a computer to produce maximum upward lift 
as with an aeroplane wing.<br>
 A toy gyroscope can remain balanced on any object and will remain in that
position in the original direction as long as the wheel keeps 
 spinning above a certain speed of rotation.<br>
 Ships stabilizers decrease side-to-side rolling motion, but have little 
or no effect on the up and down pitch, i.e. fore and aft, motion.<br>
 Princess Cruise Line<br>
Automatic stabilizers operated by gyroscopic control were incorporated in the design of large passenger ships following their introduction by the shipbuilding firm of Denny-Brown (UK), during the 1930s.<br>
Gyro-operated stabilizers in large ships are retractable into compartments inside the hull below the waterline and are thus stowed while the ship is in narrow water, in port, or when the sea conditions are calm.<br>
 A stabilizer has the form of a pivoted fin or horizontal rudder like those
used for effecting fore and aft trim in a submarine.<br>
As the vessel begins to roll and thus deviate from the fixed plane of the gyroscope, the stabilizing mechanism comes into play and the angle of the fin is made to vary against the ship's tendency to roll.<br>

<a href="18.3.6.png">See diagram 18.3.6</a>: Magnus effect.<br>
When a rapid spinning sphere or cylinder is moving through a fluid in a direction at an angle to its axis of spin, it experiences a sideways force at right angles both to the direction of motion and the axis of spin.<br>
 A student on top of the Hoover Dam dropped a basketball and it fell almost
 vertically to the ground.<br>
However, when the basketball spinning inwards was dropped the basketball at first fell vertically, but as it gained speed downwards it moved away from the dam wall.<br>
 The axis of spin was from one student's hand to the other.<br>
 The direction of motion was down.<br>
 The sideways force was away from the Hoover dam.<br>
 When a tennis ball is hit with topspin, the axis of spin is at right angles to the direction of movement of the ball, the ball is rotating forwards, the sideways force is down, i.e. in addition to the downwards force of gravity on the ball.<br>

of water, tides simulation<br>
 1. Put a drinking glass of water on the centre of a hand-rotated circular 
 table, 
 e.g. "Lazy Susan", round table at centre of Chinese restaurants.<br>
 Spin the table and observe that the water level in the glass does not 
change.<br>
 Move the glass away from the centre of rotation and spin the table again.<br>
 The water in the glass heaves up against the side of the glass away from the centre in a parabolic shape, i.e. on a line joining the centre of the drinking glass to the axis of rotation.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">2. Extend a line passing through the axis of rotation
 and the centre of the glass to the edge of the table opposite to the drinking 
 glass.<br>
 Near this edge place a round ball of modelling clay (Plasticine) to represent
the Moon.<br>
 Rotate the table and note that the ball and heaped up water stay on the
same line.<br>
 When the round table is rotating with constant velocity the heaped up 
water just stays where it is and does not move to the left or right 
 or heap up more or less.<br>
 The heaped up water represents a high tide on the opposite side of the 
Earth to the Moon.<br>
 So there are two simultaneous high tides twelve hours apart.<br>
The high tide nearest the Moon caused by the gravitational attraction between the Moon and the ocean and the high tide on the opposite side of the Earth to the Moon.<br>
 The Earth rotates in the direction as the Moon's orbit around the Earth.<br>
High tide is at 40 minutes after the Moon reaches the highest point in the sky, i.e. about 10<sup>o</sup> west of the meridian, the high tide bulge is dragged ahead by friction between the water bulge and the Earth.<br>
