 <a href="./images/4.10x.gif">See diagram 4.10</a>: Liquid naphthalene solidifies.<br>
Experiments<br>
 Put crushed naphthalene or ethanamide (acetamide) in a test-tube in 
a container of water.<br>
 Heat gently until all the substance has melted.<br>
 Remove the test-tube from the container and fix a thermometer with its bulb in the
 melted substance.<br>
 Stir the substance with a thermometer while the substance cools and 
record the temperature every 30 seconds for 6 minutes.<br>
 Plot a graph of temperature against time.<br>
 At first the temperature drops while the substance remains liquid.<br>
 Then the temperature remains the same while the substance changes from
 liquid to solid.<br>
 When all the substance is solid, the temperature starts to drop again.<br>
 The melting point, MP, is the temperature when a solid changes to 
a liquid.<br>
The specific latent heat of fusion of a substance, L, is the quantity of heat required to change one kilogram of the substance from solid to liquid without change in temperature.<br>
 The unit is joule / kg, J kg<sup>-1</sup>.<br>
 The specific latent heat of fusion of ice = 3.34 X 10<sup>5</sup> joule
 / kg, 334 kJ kg<sup>-1</sup>.<br>

Heat energy to change liquid to vapour, boiling point, latent heat of vaporization<br>
<a href="./images/4.11x.gif">See diagram 4.11</a>: Heat required to vaporize a liquid.<br>
Experiments<br>
1. Weigh a container, add 50 mL water and weigh again.<br>
 Heat the container and water.<br>
 Put a thermometer in the water and record the rise in temperature every
 30 seconds.<br>
 Plot a temperature against time graph.<br>
 Draw the line of best fit and calculate the average temperature increase per minute.<br>
 Assume that all the heat goes into the liquid and the heat absorbed 
by the flask is small.<br>
Calculate the heat absorbed by the liquid per minute by multiplying the mass of the liquid by its specific heat and by temperature increase per minute.<br>
2. Weigh a container, add 50 mL water and weigh
 again.<br>
 Heat the container and water and allow to boil for 10 minutes.<br>
 Leave to cool then weigh the container and water.<br>
 Calculate the mass of water lost by evaporation.<br>
 This will be the heat of vaporization of the liquid.<br>
3. Put a known mass of water in a boiling flask
 and a known mass of water in a container.<br>
 Record the temperature of the water.<br>
 Heat the boiling flask and pass all the steam into the water in the 
container so that all the steam condenses to water.<br>
 When most of the water in the flask has evaporated, stop heating and
 record the temperature of the water in the container.<br>
 Leave the apparatus to cool to room temperature, weigh the water remaining
 in the flask and the water in the container.<br>
The condensing steam loses latent heat of fusion when it condenses nd loses heat when its temperature (100<sup>o</sup>C) falls to the temperature of water in the container.<br>
 The specific latent heat of vaporization of water is 2.26 MJ kg<sup>-1</sup>.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="24.12H">24.12 Atomizers<br>
See: <a href="https://www.teaching.com.au/search?action=search&q=atomizer+capH">Atomizer cap</a> (Modern Teaching Aids).<br>
Atomizer is a term used in industry for a heating element that can vaporize a liquid in the mouthpiece of a device so that the vapour it can be inhaled.<br>
Atomizers are sold separately, so need separate cartridges or drip tips containing the inhalant, which must be replaced every few weeks.<br>
Atomizers are used for fly-sprayers, perfumes and for electronic cigarettes (E-cigarettes).<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="24.0.0H"></a>24.0.0 Change of state and solutions<br>
See: <a href="Commercial.html#Models">Ice models</a> (Commercial).<br>
State of matter, solid (s), liquid (l), gas (g), aqueous solution (dissolved
 in water) (aq)<br>
Change of State, melting point and freezing point, boiling point and air pressure, evaporation and condensation, cooling by evaporation of
PVT Surfaces (for an ideal gas, the pressure, volume, temperature 3-dimensional plot on a graph, 3-dimensional models)<br>
 Change of state<br>
 The three states of matter are solid, liquid and gas.<br>
 When a substance changes from one state of matter to another, it has
 undergone a change of state (change of phase).<br>
 Change of state always occurs with a change of heat energy that flows 
 into or out of the material, but no change of temperature occurs.<br>
 During change of liquid to solid, freezing, heat leaves the liquid
as it freezes.<br>
 During change of liquid to gas, vaporization (boiling and evaporation), 
 heat goes into the liquid as it vaporizes.<br>
 During change of gas to liquid, condensation, heat leaves the gas as
 it condenses.<br>
 During change of solid to gas, sublimation, heat goes into the solid
 as it sublimates.<br>
 The heat energy exchanges during a change of state are changes in potential
 energy, not kinetic energy.<br>
 The heat energy that comes into ice during a phase change breaks the
 bonds between the molecules of water.<br>
The molecules are now at a higher potential energy state, but not, on average, moving any faster, so their average kinetic energy remains the same, and temperature remains the same.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="24.1.01H"></a>24.1.01 Phase changes, liquid / solid, M P and F P.<br>
 Change of state, melting point and freezing point<br>
 The melting point is the temperature at which a substance changes from
 solid form to liquid form.<br>
 A pure substance under standard conditions of pressure has a definite 
 melting point.<br>
 If you supply heat to a solid at its melting point, the temperature 
does not change until the melting process is complete.<br>
 The melting point of ice is 0<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 Boiling is rapid conversion of a liquid into vapour that takes place
 when the liquid reaches a certain temperature.<br>
 It involves the formation of vapour bubbles within the body of a liquid, 
 whereas evaporation occurs only at the surface.<br>
Boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which the application of heat raises the temperature of the liquid no further, but converts it to vapour.<br>
 The boiling point of water under normal pressure is 100<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 The lower the pressure, the lower the boiling point and vice versa.<br>
 Freezing is the change of state from liquid to solid that occurs at 
the freezing point of a substance.<br>
 For a given substance, freezing occurs at a definite temperature, called
 its freezing point, which is invariable under similar conditions of 
 pressure.<br>
 The temperature remains at this point until all the liquid is frozen.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="24.1.20H"></a>24.1.20 Nucleation<br>
Nucleation refers to the start of processes, including crystallization, bubble formation in a saturate liquid, liquid droplets in a saturated vapour.<br>
Nucleation sites are where nucleation occurs, e.g. suspended particles, dust, cracks in a container, iodine crystals cloud seeding, spaces in materials.<br>
Such nucleation is called heterogeneous nucleation, but if no nucleation sites it is called homogeneous nucleation, e.g. in supercooled liquids.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="24.1.02H"></a>24.1.02 Vapour pressure of water and non-volatile solvents<br>
<a href="./images/24.1.02.gif">See diagram 24.1.02</a>: Vapour Pressure.<br>
<a href="./images/24.1.03.gif">See diagram 24.1.03</a>: Vapour pressure of a liquid.<br>
Experiments<br>
1. Put a beaker of deionized water under a strong container, e.g. a bell jar, and evacuate the air with a strong pump.<br>
Measure the pressure in the container with an aneroid barometer.<br>
At 25<sup>o</sup>C, the air pressure falls from atmospheric pressure to the vapour pressure of pure water, 23.8 mm Hg (3.169 kPa) as water<br>
 molecules evaporate.<br>
2. Repeat the experiment with a 1 molal solution in water of ethylene glycol (ethane-1,2-diol, antifreeze).<br>
This lowering of vapour pressure is a colligative property, i.e. a property that depends on the relative number of particles and not their chemical properties.<br>
Colligative properties include relative lowering of vapour pressure, elevation of boiling point, depression of freezing point and osmotic pressure.<br>
The colligative properties of a dilute aqueous solution of a non-ionized solute, e.g. glucose, urea are used to measure their relative molecular masses.<br>
The colligative properties of ionized solutes are used to measure the percentage ionization.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="24.1.03H"></a>24.1.03 Raoult's law<br>
The vapour pressure of a solvent above a solution, P1 = X<sub>solvent</sub> × P1<sup>o</sup>, where X<sub>solvent</sub> =<br>
 the mole fraction of the solvent in the solution and P1<sup>o</sup> = the vapour pressure of the pure solvent.<br>
 X<sub>solvent</sub> = number of moles of solvent / total number of moles.<br>
For example, if 0.1 moles of sugar are dissolved in 10 moles of water, X<sub>solvent</sub> = 10 / 10.1 = 0.99. Raoult's law is colligative, because the solute added must not react with the solvent so the solution should behave as an ideal solution.<br>
In general, Raoult's law only applies to very dilute solutions, and is based on the principle that when a solute is added to a solvent there is a decrease in the relative number of solvent molecules at the surface of the liquid to evaporate.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="24.1.04H"></a>24.1.04 Freezing point depression and boiling point elevation<br>
<a href="./images/24.1.04.gif">See diagram 24.1.04</a>: Freezing point depression and boiling point elevation<br>
<a href="./images/24.1.04.1.gif">See diagram 24.1.04.1</a>: Elevation of boiling point<br>
B P boiling point and F P freezing point<br>
The presence of a solute raises the boiling point and lowers the freezing point.<br>
This phase diagram shows that when a non-volatile solute is dissolved in a solvent, the solvent vapour pressure is lowered.<br>
The vapour pressure curve for the solution is lower than the vapour pressure curve for pure water, but not parallel to it.<br>
The vapour pressure curve of the solution intersects the sublimation pressure curve at a lower temperature than the vapour pressure curve.<br>
Triple point<br>
The freezing points curves for the solution and water begin at the triple points, the intersections of the sublimation pressure curve and the vapour pressure curve, where solid, liquid and gas phases can simultaneously exist.<br>
So the freezing point curve for the solution is at a lower temperature than freezing point curve for water.<br>
Freezing point depression can be used to calculate the molar mass of a substance.<br>
The freezing point depression is proportional to the sum of the concentrations of all the different dissolved particles, so it can be used to measure biological concentrations, e.g. urine.<br>
Azeotrope<br>
A solution has no boiling point, because the solvent tends to evaporate more than the solute, so the concentration of the solution increases.<br>
However, a constant boiling mixture (azeotrope) is an exception to Raoult's law where the composition of the vapour is the same as the composition of the boiling liquid, e.g. a mixture of 4% water and 96% ethanol.<br>
So a mixture of water and alcohol can never be converted to absolute alcohol by boiling.<br>
F P depression<br>
Freezing point depression, dT<sub>f</sub> = i × k<sub>f</sub> × m, where dT<sub>f</sub> = difference between freezing point of solvent and freezing point of solution, as a positive value, and kf = molal freezing point depression constant, e.g. water = 1.86<sup>o</sup>C kg / mole.<br>
B P elevation<br>
Boiling point elevation, dT<sub>b</sub> = i × k<sub>b</sub> × m, where dT<sub>b</sub> = difference between boiling point of solvent and boiling point of solution, as a positive value, and k<sub>b</sub> = molal boiling point elevation constant, e.g. water = 0.52 <sup>o</sup>C kg / mole<br>
m = molality (molal concentration) mol kg<sup>-1</sup>.<br>
(Molality = moles of solute / kg of solvent.)<br>
Solvents<br>
Each solvent has a specific value for kb and kf, e.g. for benzene, kb = 2.53<sup>o</sup>C kg / mole and kf = 5.10<sup>o</sup>C kg / mole.<br>
Colligative<br>
The colligative properties (binding together of molecules) of a solution include depression of freezing point, elevation of boiling point and osmosis.<br>
The effects of alcohols on the temperature range decrease with the increase of molecular weight, because the size of colligative properties depends on the number of particles.<br>
So if equal weights of methanol (32.04 g / mole) and 1-butanol (74.12 g / mole), methanol would have more particles.<br>
Boiling point elevation can be explained by decrease of relative number of solvent molecules to evaporate.<br>
However, freezing point depression cannot be explained by saying "solute particles get in the way of solvent particles", but by difference in chemical potential of solvent particles.<br>
Salting<br>
Depression of freezing point is used when salting ice for making ice cream at home and salting roads in cold climate winters.<br>
Antifreeze<br>
Elevation of boiling point is used when adding ethylene glycol ("antifreeze") to the water of car radiators when "winterizing" the car.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="24.1.05H"></a>24.1.05 Freezing point depression of carbonated water, cola<br>
 See: <a href="Commercial.html#Aprons">Aprons</a> rubberised, (Commercial).<br>
 Carbonic acid, soda water, H2CO3:<br>
Standard atmospheric pressure = 101.325 kPa.<br>
 Pressure of Coca Cola Classic = 380 kPa.<br>
 A leading cola company suggests it should be consumed at 2<sup>o</sup>-3<sup>o</sup>C, for optimal taste and best digestion.<br>
1. A young boy in China was badly injured when he opened a can of semi-frozen soft drink that exploded in his face.<br>
Any attempt to "speed-cool" a soda can may result in a busted aluminium drink can and a stick coat on the inside of the freezer.<br>
The boy would not have been hurt if the can had been filled with water alone.<br>
Once the carbon dioxide gas has been forced out of the water as the water crystallizes, the carbon dioxide accumulates in the remaining space in the drink can and its pressure increases rapidly.<br>
The expansion of water as it freezes is important to soda detonation, not because it puts pressure on the drink can, but because it puts pressure on an increasingly cramped reservoir of gaseous carbon dioxide.<br>
2. Soda pop drink cans may explode in the freezer, but only when ice begins to form.<br>
<br>
 The freezing point of a pure solvent will be lowered by the addition
 of a solute.<br>
 The temperature at which a liquid freezes decreases as the concentration
 of dissolved materials increases.<br>
 Dissolved gases, e.g. carbon dioxide, can act as a solute and its concentration
 is dependent on pressure.<br>
 Carbon dioxide dissolves as follows:<br>
 CO2 + H2O--> H<sup>+</sup> + HCO3<sup>-</sup><br>
 The dissolved HCO3<sup>-</sup> in solution changes the freezing  point.<br>
Experiment<br>
 Do the following experiment away from students behind a safety screen.<br>
 Wear chemical splash goggles, chemical-resistant gloves, and a chemical-resistant
 apron.<br>
 Remove the label from the plastic soda water bottle and cool it in
a refrigerator overnight.<br>
 Prepare an ice salt mixture with rock salt sprinkled over crushed ice 
 in a beaker.<br>
 Put the cooled bottle of soda water in the beaker and cover it with 
layers of ice and rock salt.<br>
 Insert a thermometer into the ice salt mixture so that it touches the 
 plastic bottle.<br>
 Allow the temperature to drop to -8 C and stay there for about 10 minutes.<br>
 Do not allow the temperature to drop to below -10 C, because the plastic
 bottle may explode.<br>
 Carefully remove the plastic bottle from the ice water mixture, but 
do not shake it.<br>
 The soda water is still liquid.<br>
 The liquid soda water turns to instant ice when the bottle is opened.<br>
3. The concentration of carbon dioxide in soft drinks remains constant only as long as the drink can or bottle is kept sealed.<br>
When the containers are opened, the carbon dioxide fizzes out of the container, so the concentration of solutes in the water decreases and the freezing point rises, so the soft drink will freeze more quickly.<br>
Another explanation for the fizzing is that the soft drink is a supercooled solution ready for freezing.<br>
The carbon dioxide bubbles that form when the container is opened provide sites for the nucleation of the ice crystals.<br>
Tapping the chilled container without opening it may allow some carbon dioxide bubbles to form, followed by freezing within the unopened container.<br>

 Critical temperature is the temperature above which a gas cannot be 
liquefied by pressure.<br>
 For water, the upper limit of the vaporization curve is at 374<sup>o</sup>C 
 and 218 atm, called the critical point.<br>
 Above the critical temperature, a gas cannot exist in the liquid state
 no matter what pressure is applied.<br>
 Helium has the lowest critical temperature, -268<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 The critical point for carbon dioxide is 31<sup>o</sup>C and 73 atm.<br>
 At the critical point the liquid and gas phases have the same density.<br>
 At the critical point the physical properties of the liquid and gaseous
 phases are the same.<br>
 At the critical point (critical stat<b>e)</b> the liquid state of the 
 matter ceases to exist.<br>
When a liquid is heated, its density decreases and the pressure and density of its vapour increases, until the critical temperature is reached where the two densities are equal and the phase boundary between liquid and gas disappears.<br>
 The heat of vaporization becomes zero.<br>
 The critical point of water is at 647K (374C) and 22.064 MPa (3200
PSIA or 218 atmospheres, atm.).<br>

 If particles of 3 ions, i = 3, e.g. MgCl2.).<br>
 If particles associate in solution, i &lt;1. e.g. ethanoic acid in

 If particles neither associate nor dissociate, i =1, e.g. glucose in

See: <a href="Commercial.html#Models">Ice models</a> (Commercial).<br>
<a href="./images/24.2.7.gif">See diagram 24.2.7</a>: Lift ice cube with salt.<br>
Experiments<br>
 1. Ice melts and freezes again by the action of salt.<br>
 Put an ice cube in a full cup of cold water so that it floats.<br>
 Let a thread lie on the ice cube and sprinkle salt on it, see the diagram.<br>
 The aim of sprinkling salt is to wet the thread by melting the ice
near the thread.<br>
 Wait until the melted ice near the thread condenses again.<br>
 Lift one end of the thread to check if water on it has frozen completely.<br>
 If it is, lift two ends of the thread to hold the ice cube from the 
water.<br>
 Salt lowers the freezing temperature of water so some ice at the top
 of the ice cube melts to form salty water that is absorbed by the 
 dry string.<br>
The melting water washes aside the salt, so the concentration of salt water near the string drops and the freezing point raises again, allowing the water at the top of the ice cube to freeze again and trap the string.<br>
2. Float an ice cube in water.<br>
 Put a matchstick on the ice.<br>
 Sprinkle a very small amount of salt on to the ice at each side of
the matchstick.<br>
 After one minute, lift the ice cube by lifting the matchstick.<br>
 Salt water has a lower melting point or freezing point than pure water.<br>
 The salt sprinkled on the ice dissolves in the ice lowering its freezing
 point.<br>
 The ice around the matchstick melts and the matchstick floats in it.<br>
Some of the water may fall off the ice cube, but the salt keeps dissolving in the ice so lowering the concentration of salt around the matchstick, and raising the freezing point back towards 0<sup>o</sup>C, when it freezes again trapping the matchstick in the ice.<br>
The layer of water between the matchstick and the ice cube is now frozen, so the matchstick sticks to the ice.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="24.1.4H"></a>24.1.4 Latent heat, change 
 of state, melting and boiling<br>
 1. A change in the physical state (solid, liquid, or gas) of a material
 is called a change of state, e.g. melting, boiling, evaporation, 
 solidification and condensation.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">2. Latent heat of fusion<br>
The amount of heat per unit mass that has to be removed to freeze a substance is a constant for any given substance, called the latent heat of fusion.<br>
 When a pure substance changes from solid to liquid the temperature
does not rise, but remains at the melting point until all the solid has 
 melted.<br>
 The heat required to melt one kilogram of the substance is called the 
 latent heat of fusion,<br>
 Water = 3.33 × 10<sup>5 </sup>joule / kg.<br>
The high latent heat of fusion of water, 333 kj kg<sup>-1</sup>, prevents water temperature from changing quickly at temperatures near 0<sup>o</sup>C above or below, because of the extra energy needed to freeze or melt water.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">3. Latent heat of vaporization<br>
The heat required to evaporate one kilogram of the substance is called the latent heat of vaporization, e.g. Water = 22.6 × 10<sup>5</sup> joule / kg.<br>
When a pure substance changes from liquid to vapour, the temperature does not rise, but remains at the boiling point until all the liquid has boiled away.<br>
 A pure substances absorbs heat energy to change from solid to liquid
 at the constant temperature of the melting point.<br>
 The heat required to melt 1 kilogram of the substance is called the 
latent heat of fusion (l<sub>f</sub>).<br>
 The l<sub>f</sub> of water = 3.33 × 10<sup>5</sup> joule / kg.<br>
 A pure substances absorbs heat energy to change from liquid to vapour 
 at the constant temperature of the boiling point.<br>
 The heat required to evaporate 1 kilogram of the substance is called
 the latent heat of vaporization (l<sub>v</sub>).<br>
 The l<sub>v</sub> of water = 22.6 × 10<sup>5</sup> joule / kg.<br>
 The latent heat of evaporation of water is the highest of all substances, 
 2260 kj kg<sup>-1</sup>, which reduces water loss and heat loss to the 
 atmosphere.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">4. Phase change<br>
The assembled state of molecules or atoms in matter is called phase.<br>
 The transformation of the matter from a state to another is called
phase change.<br>
 The amount of heat absorbed or emitted by an object of unit mass in 
the process of phase change is called latent heat in phase change.<br>
 The heat of vaporization, the heat of solution and the heat of sublimation
 are all latent heat in phase change.<br>
Under the same pressure, the same kind of matters are transformed from liquid state to steam state, the heat of vaporization needed is equal to that from steam state back to liquid state.<br>
If the three phases solid, liquid and steam, exist together, the heat of sublimation = the heat of solution + the heat of vaporization.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="24.1.5H"></a>24.1.5 Latent heat of fusion of ice to water<br>
Experiments<br>
 1. Weigh a 500 mL beaker.<br>
 Half fill with crushed ice and weigh again.<br>
 Record the temperature of the ice.<br>
 Heat the beaker and ice for a minute and again note its temperature.<br>
 Repeat until all the ice has been melted for several minutes.<br>
 Record your observations as: State of matter, Time in minutes, Temperature
 in "C.<br>
 Draw a graph of your results by plotting temperature against time and 
 note the shape of the graph.<br>
 When there is no ice, but only ice water, weigh the container and contents.<br>
 There should be no noticeable change in mass, because few particles from the original ice or water have escaped.<br>
2. Continue as in the last experiment heating more
 strongly and note the temperature every minute until the water boils.<br>
 Again there would be no noticeable change in mass until a considerable
 number of molecules have been lost as steam.<br>
 Again record your results and make a graph of temperature against time.<br>
 Note the rise in temperature as heat is supplied.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="24.1.6H"></a>24.1.6 Bitumen foaming and bitumen decay<br>
 The behaviour of bitumen during foaming is primarily due to physical
 processes although chemistry does also play a role.<br>
When a cold water droplet at ambient temperature makes contact with the bitumen at 170<sup>o</sup>C to 180<sup>o</sup>̊C, this chain of events occurs:<br>
* The bitumen exchanges energy with the surface of the water droplet 
 heating the droplet to a temperature of 100̊C and cooling the 
 bitumen.<br>
* The transferred energy of the bitumen exceeds the latent heat of 
steam resulting in explosive expansion and the generation of steam.<br>
* Steam bubbles are forced into the continuous phase of bitumen under
 pressure.<br>
* With emission from the bitumen spray nozzle the encapsulated steam expands until a thin film of slightly cooler bitumen holds the bubble intact through its surface tension.<br>
* During expansion, the surface tension of the bitumen film counteracts
 the ever diminishing steam pressure until a state of equilibrium 
 is reached.<br>
 Due to the low thermal conductivity of bitumen and water, the bubble
 can remain stable for a few seconds.<br>
* So many bitumen bubbles form to together produce foamed bitumen.<br>
* As the colloidal mass cools to ambient temperature, the steam in 
the bubbles condenses causing bubbles to collapse and the 
 bitumen foam to "decay".<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="24.1.7H"></a>24.1.7 Heat of crystallization of sodium thiosulfate<br>
Experiments<br>
 1. Put 2 cm of sodium thiosulfate crystals in a test-tube, put the test-tube in a beaker of water and slowly heat the beaker with a Bunsen burner.<br>
When the crystals have melted, take out the test-tube, dry it with a cloth and drop in a small crystal of sodium thiosulfate.<br>
Crystals form in all directions from the small crystal and the liquid becomes completely solid with crystals.<br>
You can feel the rise in temperature in the test-tube, showing that the formation of crystals is an exothermic process.<br>
2. Heat a half-filled test-tube of sodium thiosulfate 
 crystals (sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate, Na2S2O3.5H2O) 
 in a beaker of hot water.<br>
 Gently heat the beaker so that the sodium thiosulfate dissolves in
its own water of crystallization.<br>
 So heat gently otherwise you will drive off all the water of crystallization
 to form anhydrous sodium hyposulfite (hypo).<br>
When the crystals have all melted, cover the test-tube and leave to cool in an insulated beaker containing tap water at the height of the melted crystals in the test-tube.<br>
 Put one thermometer in the melted crystals and fix another thermometer 
 in the tap water in the beaker.<br>
If the temperature of the solution is below the melting point, it is a supercooled solution that will form crystals if a crystal of sodium thiosulfate is added to the solution, or if the solution is stirred.<br>
Stir the melted crystals with the thermometer very carefully, so that you do not break the thermometer when crystals form.<br>
 Record the temperatures in the two thermometers as the sodium thiosulfate
 solidifies to form crystals again.<br>
 Let all the crystals form around the thermometer and later remove the 
 thermometer by dissolving the crystals in running tap water.<br>
 The temperature of the sodium thiosulfate remains constant as the crystals form, and only then does the temperature fall, because the room temperature is lower than the melting point of sodium thiosulfate, 48.3<sup>o</sup> C.<br>
However, the temperature of the tap water in the beaker rises as the sodium thiosulfate cools and continues to rise as the sodium thiosulfate crystals form, because the reaction is exothermic.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="24.1.8H"></a>24.1.8 Heat of crystallization of sodium acetate<br>
 Heat of crystallization is defined as the increase in enthalpy when 1 mole of a substance is transformed into its crystalline state at constant pressure.<br>
Experiments<br>
1. Prepare a supersaturated solution of sodium acetate and drop in a crystal to trigger crystallization.<br>
 A thermocouple will show the change in temperature.<br>
 Observe the change in temperature when a flask of supercooled sodium
 acetate crystallizes.<br>
2. Gently heat sodium acetate trihydrate crystals 
 to 54<sup>o</sup>C so that they dissolve in their own water of crystallization.<br>
 Keep heating the solution up to 100<sup>o</sup>C, then leave to cool.<br>
 This supersaturated solution can be cooled to room temperature without
 forming crystals so it is used in a sodium acetate self-heating 
 pack.<br>
 These heat packs are used for medical purposes to provide heat externally
 to parts of the body.<br>
 The heat pack sold in pharmacies consists of a sodium acetate solution and
a copper disc sealed in a plastic envelope.<br>
The patient can bend the disc by squeezing it through the heat pack to cause friction between the disc and the sodium acetate to change the liquid solution to become solid in an exothermic reaction.<br>
The reaction generates heat in seconds up to 54<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
The crystals in the pack can be returned to the liquid state by immersing the pack in boiling water for about 10 minutes so the sodium acetate heat pack is very handy, because the change is reversible and the heat pack can be used again and again.<br>
 The latent heat of fusion of sodium acetate is about 264289 kJ / kg.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="24.1.9H"></a>24.1.9 Heat of crystallization of sodium sulfate, heat of fusion<br>
 Sodium sulfate decahydrate crystals, Na2SO4.10H2O, (Glauber's salt), melt at a conveniently low temperature of 32<sup>o</sup>C, but they do not store as much heat as sodium acetate crystals.<br>
 The heat of fusion of sodium sulfate decahydrate is 25.53 kJ / mol.<br>
The term "heat of fusion" is used to describe the energy required to change an amount of a substance from solid to liquid without changing its temperature.<br>
Heat of fusion (standard enthalpy of fusion), (specific melting heat), describes the change in heat energy required for a substance to change its state from solid to liquid or vice versa at the melting point of the substance.<br>
 The specific heat of fusion refers to heat of fusion referenced to
a unit of mass.<br>
 The molar heat of fusion refers to the heat of fusion referenced to 
the enthalpy change per amount of substance in moles.<br>
Substances with high heat of fusion are called PCMs, (phase change materials), or LHS units, (latent heat storage units).<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="24.1.13H"></a>24.1.13 Hot water freezes faster than cold water, the Mpemba effect<br>
 Hot water, e.g. 90<sup>o</sup>C does appear to freeze faster than the 
 same amount of cold water, e.g. 18<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
This phenomenon was observer by Aristotle 4th century BC and is named after Erasto Mpemba, a schoolboy in Tanzania, who drew attention to it.<br>
The initially hot water has less of the apparently frozen ice solid, because it contains trapped liquid water.<br>
The initially cold water freezes at a lower temperature to a solid ice with less included liquid water.<br>
The initial lower temperature causes intensive nucleation and a faster crystal growth rate.<br>
At a freezing temperature of -6<sup>o</sup> C, the initially hot water apparently freezes first, but eventually the initially cold water completely freezes before the initially hot water.<br>
Initially cold water will have the maximum concentration of such 20-face clusterings that do not easily allow the rearrangement of water molecules<br>
for formation of hexagonal ice crystals.<br>
Initially, hot water has lost its ordered clustering, so if the cooling time is short, clustering will not occur fully before freezing.<br>

<a href="./images/24.239.gif">See diagram 24.239</a>: Pressure affects boiling point of water: A Steam, B Boiling tube, C Water.<br>
 Boiling depends on bubbles of water vapour forming within the liquid being heated.<br>
 A liquid boils when its saturation vapour pressure = external pressure.<br>
 The pressure inside a bubble near the surface of a liquid = pressure of the gas in the bubble, Pa + saturation vapour pressure of the liquid, Pv.<br>
 If P = pressure acting on the surface of the liquid, i.e. atmospheric pressure, and 2S / r = pressure in the bubble caused by surface tension, P + 2S / r = Pa + Pv.<br>
 When temperature increases, Pv increases and Pa decreases, because P is constant, so the bubble expands.<br>
 At the temperature when P = Pv and Pa approximately = 0, 2S / r is negligible, the volume of the bubble expands greatly and the water boils.<br>
 The liquid boils when the saturation pressure = the external pressure, so increase of external pressure raises the boiling point and vice versa.<br>
 The boiling point, BP, of water at standard atmospheric pressure, 760 mmHg, 101 325 Pa, is 100<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 Boiling point changes about 1<sup><sub>o</sub></sup>C for each 28 mmHg change in pressure.<br>
 At sea level water boils at 100<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 Height above sea level and boiling point: 600 m (98<sup>o</sup>C), 500 m (95<sup>o</sup>C), 2000 m (93<sup>o</sup>C), 3000 m (90<sup>o</sup>C).<br>
At 3658 m on a mountain in the Himalayas, the boiling point of water was 88<sup>o</sup>C, but in a home pressure cooker the boiling point reaches <sup>o</sup>C,<br>so the food cooks faster.<br>
 Motor vehicle radiators have a pressure cap to keep water in a liquid state at temperatures over 100<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
Water boils faster with a lid completely or partially on a container, not because of increased pressure, but because steam can condense on the bottom surface of the lid instead of escaping and taking away some heat.<br>
Experiments<br>
<a href="./images/3.8x.gif">See diagram 3.8</a>: Decreasing the pressure on boiling water<br>
 1. Put water in a sidearm test-tube or in a round bottom flask with 
a one-hole stopper.<br>
 Push a thermometer through a hole in the stopper so that the bulb of
 thermometer reaches, but does not touch, the bottom of the 
 test-tube or flask.<br>
 Add boiling chips to prevent bumping.<br>
 Boil the water and read the temperature.<br>
 Stop heating.<br>
 Connect a water pump to the sidearm or to the second hole of the 2-hole
 stopper.<br>
 When the water stops boiling, turn on the water pump to reduce the
pressure.<br>
 Read the temperature, heat to boiling and read the temperature again.<br>
2. Go to a high mountain and put a raw egg in an
 open cooking pot containing cold water.<br>
 Heat the water in the pot and note the boiling point.<br>
 The water boils and evaporates at a low temperature so you cannot cook
 the egg!<br>
 People who climb Mount Everest complain that they cannot get a good 
cup of tea, because the water boils at too low a temperature!<br>
 Put a potato in a pressure cooker containing cold water.<br>
 Be sure that the valve on the lid is in the open position.<br>
 Heat the water until it boils and steam comes through the valve.<br>
 Close the valve.<br>
 The potato cooks very quickly in the high temperature and pressure.<br>
3. This method does not allow you to measure the
 pressure or the temperature inside the flask, but it is the safest method.<br>
 Boil water in half full round bottom flask.<br>
 Stop heating and insert a tight one-hole stopper fitted with a thermometer.<br>
 Support the inverted flask on a ring stand, thermometer pointing down.<br>
 Pour cold water on the bottom of the flask.<br>
 As the steam condenses, the pressure on the water lowers and the water
 boils again at a lower temperature.<br>
 Pour more cold water on the bottom of the flask.<br>
 The water boils again at a still lower temperature.<br>
4. Fit a 3-hole stopper with a thermometer, an
open manometer, and an outlet tube for steam.<br>
 Put plenty of grease around the stopper then insert it firmly, but not 
 tightly into a flask that is half full of water.<br>
 Heat the flask slowly.<br>
Note the bubbles of air and later the larger bubbles of steam that form at the bottom of the flask, rise to the top, and condense on leaving the outlet tube and striking the air.<br>
 Observe the temperature rise to 100<sup>o</sup>C and then remain steady.<br>
 Carefully apply a screw clamp and partly close the outlet valve.<br>
 <b>Be careful! Do not close completely or an explosion
 can result!</b><br>
 With the outlet partly closed the steam cannot escape as quickly so 
the manometer show an increase of pressure inside the flask.<br>
 The temperature of the water rises and the bubbling stops, because the temperature that water boils at which water boils depends on 
 the pressure.<br>
 Motor car radiators have a pressure cap to keep water in a liquid state
 at temperatures over 100<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 Remove the Bunsen burner so that the water begins to cool.<br>
 Connect an aspirator to the outlet tube to reduce the pressure in the 
 flask.<br>
 With reduced pressure the water begins to boil again at a lower temperature.<br>
5. Food cooks quickly in a pressure cooker, because the pressure of the steam above the water in the cooker can be twice the atmospheric pressure with the water boiling at about 120<sup>o</sup>C, so food can be cooked more quickly.<br>
6. Half fill a round bottom flask with water and
 insert a two-hole stopper fitted with a thermometer and a glass outlet
 tube.<br>
 Support the flask in a ring stand.<br>
 The bulb of the thermometer should be in the water.<br>
 Do not heat the flask.<br>
 Use rubber tubing to connect an exhaust pump to the glass outlet.<br>
 Record the temperature.<br>
 Start pumping air, and water vapour, out of the flask.<br>
 Students can see the air bubbles rise first and can then watch the
water boil at room temperature.<br>
7. Fit a 3-hole stopper with a thermometer, an 
open manometer, and an outlet tube for steam.<br>
 Put plenty of grease around the stopper then insert it firmly, but not 
 tightly into a flask that is half full of water.<br>
 Heat the flask slowly.<br>
 Bubbles of air, and later larger bubbles of steam, form at the bottom 
 of the flask then rise to the top.<br>
 The steam condenses on leaving the outlet tube and striking the air.<br>
 Note the temperature rise to 100<sup>o</sup>C and then remains steady.<br>
 Carefully apply a screw clamp and partly close the outlet valve.<br>
 <b> Be careful!</b> Do not close the flask completely or an explosion 
 can result.<br>
 With the outlet partly closed, the steam cannot escape as quickly so
 the manometer shows an increase of pressure inside the flask.<br>
 The temperature of the water rises and the bubbling stops, because the 
 temperature that water boils at which water boils depends on 
 the pressure.<br>
 Remove the Bunsen burner so that the water begins to cool.<br>
 Connect an aspirator to the outlet tube to reduce the pressure in the 
 flask.<br>
 With reduced pressure the water begins to boil again at a lower temperature.<br>
8. Use a thermometer which measuring range is over
 100<sup>o</sup>C, a pressure cooker and a aluminium cooker with a lid
on which there is 
 hole.<br>
 Add water in both cookers.<br>
 Cover the pressure cooker, take off the valve used to reduce the pressure.<br>
 Cover the aluminium cooker, tighten the lid by several clips.<br>
 Heat the two cookers over a roaring fire until water in two cookers 
boils violent.<br>
Wear a pair of gloves, hold the top of the thermometer, put the measuring bulb of thermometer into the steam outlet on pressure cooker first, then into the hole on the lid of aluminium cooker.<br>
 The thermometer stays in steam until the liquid column in thermometer 
 does not rise up.<br>
 Record from the thermometer in two cases.<br>
The readings you have read may have difference from boiling point of water in the cooker, but the difference between two readings shows the difference of temperatures caused by pressure in the cooker.<br>
 Pour flask with half full of water, cover a stopper which is inserted 
 with a thermometer.<br>
 Put it on a frame, heat it over an alcohol burner until the water boils, 
 record the temperature at the moment.<br>
 Then remove the flask from the heat source by using a test-tube clip.<br>
 Place the flask over an empty container.<br>
Wait for a while, as the readings in thermometer begins to drop (do not open the lid), pour cold water on the flask, observe that the water in the flask boils again.<br>
 Record the temperature again.<br>
 As the steam condenses while it becomes cold, the pressure in the flask
 reduces, so water boils again.<br>
 Pour a flask with half full of water, insert a stopper with two holes.<br>
 One hole is for inserting thermometer, the other is for inserting a 
tube used for conducting out.<br>
 Insert a thermometer into water in the flask.<br>
 Insert a short glass tube, the end downward must be far from the surface
 of water, connect the upper end of it a pump apparatus with 
 a rubber tube.<br>
 Fix the flask stable with a pad, then begin to pump air out.<br>
 Observe that with the pressure in the flask decreases, first you observe
 some air bulbs rise up from water, then water begins to boil.<br>
 Record the temperature of water in the flask.<br>
 If temperature of water is very high, pump only by using a large syringe.<br>
 This time, to consider the second pumping, add a rubber tube screw
clamping apparatus on rubber tube as shown in the diagram.<br>
 After pump screw the clamping tightly, then take out the syringe from 
 rubber tube.<br>
 Push out air inside the syringe (i.e. push the inner cylinder to the
 bottom of the outer one), connect the rubber tube again.<br>
 Unscrew the clamping, pump secondly.<br>
 If temperature of water is merely that in the room, or to avoid the 
trouble of pumping secondly, the pump apparatus is better to be the 
 pump or air pump.<br>

Experiments<br>
<b>Be careful!</b> Do this experiment behind a safety screen!<br>
 This experiment can be very dangerous because the glass flask could explode!<br>
 Heat the flask with the pinch clip open.<br>
 When boiling commences at 100<sup>o</sup>C, close the clip just long enough to see the temperature start to rise, then open the clip and turn off the gas.<br>
 Temperature of boiling water or rather the temperature of the steam above water boiling under pressure is greater than in the normal atmosphere.<br>
 The steam is not allowed to escape and the thermometer reading rises.<br>
 In a pressure cooker, the pressure of the steam above the boiling water can be twice normal atmospheric pressure and the boiling point can be 120<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 The high pressure cooks the food more quickly.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="24.3.03H"></a>24.3.03 Cooling by evaporation, sweat glands<br>
 During evaporation the faster particles escape from the surface of
the liquid so the net kinetic energy of all the particles in the liquid 
 is lowered.<br>
 So evaporation has a cooling effect.<br>
We feel cooler when evaporation of liquids from our sweat glands occur, but when the humidity is high we feel uncomfortable, because evaporation does not occur easily.<br>
 Evaporation is the process in which a liquid turns to a vapour without
 its temperature reaching boiling point.<br>
At any time, a proportion of its molecules will be fast enough (have enough kinetic energy) to escape from the attractive intermolecular forces at the liquid surface and into the atmosphere.<br>
 As the mean kinetic energy of the molecules of the liquid rises, the
 number of the molecules of the liquid possessing enough energy to 
 escape rises.<br>
 So the rate of evaporation rises with increased temperature.<br>
 Condensation is the conversion of a vapour to a liquid as it loses
heat.<br>
 This is frequently achieved by letting the vapour come into contact 
with a cold surface.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="24.3.02H"></a>24.3.02 Sublimation<br>
Sublimation is the change of state from solid to vapour, or from vapour to solid, which occurs without passing through an intermediate liquid state.<br>
Under normal temperature and pressure, only ice, dry ice, camphor, sulfur, phosphor may sublimate.<br>
In the formation of white frost, for example, water vapour in the atmosphere passes directly from the vapour state to the solid crystals of ice that make up frost.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="24.3.01H"></a>24.3.01 Evaporation<br>
Evaporation occurs when water particles have enough kinetic energy (latent heat) to change from the liquid phase to the vapour phase.<br>
The speed of evaporation depends on atmospheric pressure, relative humidity, speed of air flow, level of solar radiation (especially infrared radiation), water purity, water surface area, water temperature.<br>

<a href="./images/24.3.7photo.jpg">See photo</a> Drinking bird.<br>
Experiments<br>
<a href="./images/24.3.7.gif">See diagram 24.3.7</a>: Drinking bird.<br>
 1. The drinking bird is a small heat engine that converts a temperature 
 difference into cyclical motion.<br>
 It is not a toy, and may be adjusted to work properly by moving the 
sleeve up or down the connecting tube.<br>
 However, it contains toxic and hazardous liquids, so only the teacher, 
 not the students, should make any adjustments to it.<br>
 Some toy product versions of drinking bird do not work well below a
room temperature of 25<sup>o</sup>C!<br>
2. The drinking bird consists of two glass bulbs for head and body connected by a glass connecting tube that dips down into a volatile liquid in the body, usually methylene chloride (dichloromethane, CH2Cl2, "methylene chloride").<br>
 Methylene chloride is an organic solvent, in paint strippers, and has 
 a low boiling point of 39.6<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 Previously ether, Freon and other volatile liquids were used.<br>
 A sleeve attached to a pivot, fulcrum, clasps the glass tube.<br>
 Each end of the pivot is inserted into holes at the top of the legs.<br>
 The head bulb contains vapour and is covered with absorbent material, 
 e.g. felt, to form a head covering and a beak.<br>
3. Put a container full of cold water in front of
the drinking duck such that the height of the sides of the container are
 just lower than the 
 height of the pivot.<br>
 Hold your warm fingers around the body bulb to increase the vapour
pressure and force liquid up the connecting tube into the head bulb.<br>
 The centre of gravity lowers so the head tips forward.<br>
 The beak and head becomes immersed in the water which the absorbent 
material absorbs.<br>
 The lower end of the connecting tube rises above the level of
liquid in the body.<br>
 Bubbles of vapour pass up through the connecting tube to equalize the 
 vapour pressure in the head bulb and body bulb.<br>
 Liquid is displaced down the connecting tube to re-enter the body.<br>
 The centre of gravity rises and the head of the drinking bird rises 
again.<br>
 The body bulb + liquid is heavier than the head bulb.<br>
4. Cooling by evaporation.<br>
 As the water in the absorbent material evaporates, vapour in the head 
 loses latent heat of vaporization, becomes cooler, and condenses.<br>
 The vapour pressure in the head bulb decreases relative to the vapour 
 pressure in the body bulb.<br>
 Liquid rises up the connecting tube and enters the head bulb.<br>
 The head becomes heavier than the body.<br>
 The drinking duck tips down and the absorbent material in the beak
absorbs water from the container.<br>
 Water starts to evaporate from the wet absorbent material and the cycle
 starts again.<br>

 safe<br>
Experiments<br>
 People living in the bush keep water in a canvass water bag hung under
 a tree in the shade or attached to the bumper car of a vehicle.<br>
 Water seeps through the canvass and evaporates from its outside surface
 to keep the water cool.<br>
Water evaporates from the bag, latent heat is required to change the water from liquid to vapour state, this heat is taken from the water in the bag, and its temperature falls, a steady state being reached when the quantity of heat taken from the water to evaporate part of it is equal to the heat received from the surroundings on account of the temperature difference between the water in the bag and the surroundings.<br>
 The more rapidly the water evaporates, the greater the temperature
difference between the water and the surroundings.<br>
 So the bag should be placed in a current of air in the shade.<br>
 On a hot, muggy day the relative humidity is high, therefore evaporation 
 is slow, and the water will be only slightly cooler than the 
 surroundings.<br>
 On a hot, dry day the relative humidity is low, evaporation is rapid, 
 and the water will be considerably cooler than the surroundings.<br>

Supersaturation in the atmosphere refers to a vapour that has a higher pressure or partial pressure than the vapour pressure of that compound.<br>
When perfectly clean air is slightly cooled below its dew point temperature, the air becomes supersaturated, but no droplets form, because saturation vapour pressure is greater over a curved surface than over a plane surface.<br>
The smaller the radius of curvature the greater the effect such that if a small drop does form it immediately evaporate again.<br>
In supersaturated air, water droplets may precipitate upon being disturbed as in a cloud chamber or by increasing the rate of supersaturation to a four-fold value and more so that precipitation occurs, first on negative ions, later on positive ions and later on the water molecules themselves.<br>
 However, particles of dust provide condensation nuclei on which condensation may occur, because the radius of the dust particles are large enough to make the curved surface effect negligible.<br>

 1. Refrigerator<br>
 In a refrigerator, food loses heat by conduction, convection and radiation
 to the air, shelves and inner cabinet.<br>
 Volatile refrigerant fluids in a coil around the freezer evaporate
and so take in latent heat to cause cooling.<br>
The vapour from this evaporation is removed by an electric pump to the black heat exchanger coil with cooling fins behind the refrigerator. which radiates heat to the surrounding air.<br>
When the electric pump removes vapour from the coil around the freezer, it also reduces the pressure in the coil and lowers the boiling point and induces more evaporation.<br>
 In the heat exchanger coil the vapour compresses, loses latent heat 
of vaporization, and is returned as a liquid to the coil around the 
 freezer.<br>
 The electric pump can be adjusted to switch on and off to control the 
 temperature of the refrigerator.<br>

 Hero's engine (Hero of Alexandria, 10-70 AD), a radial steam engine, 
 is a sphere or cylinder metal container with oppositely curving nozzles.<br>
When water in the container is heated, the steam leaves through the nozzles in opposite directions to cause opposite thrust, torque, and rotate the container.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="24.8.0H"></a>24.8.0 Heat loss by the human body<br>
The human body loses heat in raising the temperature from room temperature to body temperature of the surrounding air and objects, e.g. a chair, clothes, food and drink entering the body, cold air inhaled after the warm air has been exhaled.<br>
 The amount of heat lost is the sum of ms(t2-t1), where m = mass of
objects or air, s = specific heat of objects or air, t2-t1 = change in 
 temperature.<br>
 Also, the human body loses heat in evaporating water as perspiration
 from the skin body and as vapour in the breath.<br>
 The amount of heat lost is the sum of mL, where m = mass of water vaporized
 and L= latent heat.<br>
 The human body loses heat by conduction, convection and radiation, 
and evaporation of moisture.<br>
In cold climates, the loss of heat can be reduced by suitable clothing made of bad conducting material, e.g. wool or fur so that the air does not contact the skin except at the face, and so reduce convection currents.<br>
 Also, evaporation into the atmosphere occurs only from the uncovered
 portions of the body.<br>
 Evaporation from other parts of the body occurs into a closed air spaces
 that ceases when the spaces becomes saturated.<br>
 Loss of heat by radiation is reduced by wearing bad radiators, e.g. 
white, or shiny surfaces for the outer garment, unless in direct 
 sunlight.<br>
 In hot climates, the gain of heat can be reduced by suitable clothing 
 that absorb little direct radiation as possible, e.g. white clothes.<br>
 Clothes should be loose so that the air can move freely round the body, 
 and so increase the loss of heat by evaporation.<br>
 If the air temperature is lower than the body temperature, clothes should be good conductors to conduct heat away from the body and as loose or scanty to facilitate cooling by convection and evaporation.<br>
If the air temperature is higher than the body temperature, cooling depends on evaporation into air with free access to the body and in circulation to increase evaporation.<br>
On a cold still day, heat radiated from the body raises the temperature of the air in contact with the body, so that the temperature of the local surroundings is higher than the actual air temperature.<br>
 On a windy day the air in contact with the body is continually being
 removed, and so has approximately the true air temperature.<br>
 Also, on a windy day evaporation occurs more rapidly than on a similar
 still day, so that the loss of heat by evaporation is also increased.<br>

Newton's law of cooling states that the rate of loss of heat from a body both by radiation and convection is proportional to the difference between the temperature of the body and the temperature of the surroundings.<br>
 It applies only to small ranges in temperature.<br>
Experiments<br>
 Test whether a hot cup of coffee cools faster than a warm cup of coffee.<br>
 Record the room temperature, e.g. 17.5<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 Use identical coffee cups.<br>
 Put the same volume of hot coffee or warm coffee in the coffee cups.<br>
 Insert a thermometer and use it to keep stirring gently.<br>
 Record the temperature every two minutes for twenty minutes while still
 stirring.<br>
 In the second column, record the temperature of the cooling water every
 two minutes.<br>
 In column D, record the difference between the temperatures every two 
 minutes and the room temperature.<br>
 Calculate F / D for each two minute interval.<br>
 The mass of coffee in the coffee cup is constant so the rate of heat
 loss of the coffee is proportional to the fall in temperature.<br>
 The rate of fall of temperature is proportional to the mean difference
 of temperature between the coffee and the surroundings.<br>
 So the fall in temperature during time interval / mean difference in
 temperature between the coffee and surroundings = constant.<br>
As the temperature of the body is higher and the temperature of surroundings is lower, the difference of the two temperatures is greater, so the rate of heat loss of the body is faster.<br>

<a name="24.23H"></a> 24.23 Moving air affects the rate of evaporation<br>
Experiments<br>
 With a moist sponge or cloth, wet two areas of equal size some distance
 apart on a cool blackboard surface.<br>
 Fan one area with a piece of cardboard and leave the other to evaporate
 without fanning.<br>
 The wind difference causes the difference in rate of evaporation.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="24.24H"></a> 24.24 Moisture in the air affects
the rate of evaporation<br>
Experiments<br>
 Half fill two identical dishes with water.<br>
 Suspend a wet cloth over one dish.<br>
 Note the different rates of evaporation in the two dishes.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="24.29H"></a> 24.29 Cloud in a bottle<br>
<a href="./images/37.135.gif">See diagram 37.135</a>: Cloud in a bottle.<br>
Experiments<br>
 1. Add a small amount of water to a plastic drink bottle.<br>
 Light a match, blow it out and drop the smoking match stick into the
 bottle.<br>
 Immediately screw on the lid and start squeezing the bottle.<br>
 The cloud in the bottle from the burning match stick smoke disappears 
 when you squeeze the bottle.<br>
 Inside the bottle water vapour condenses on the smoke particles that
 act as nucleation sites.<br>
 When you squeeze the bottle the temperature of the air inside it increases
 and the condensed water vapour on the smoke particles 
 evaporates.<br>
 2. Pour a little water into a jar wider than your 
 fist.<br>
 Screw on the lid tightly and leave for half an hour.<br>
 Put a stick of white blackboard chalk in a plastic bag and use a hammer
 to crush it to a fine powder.<br>
 Cut the neck off a party balloon.<br>
 Open the jar and put in the chalk powder and immediately stretch the
 balloon over the opening of the jar until the rubber is horizontal 
 over the opening.<br>
 Fix a rubber band around the neck of the jar to keep the balloon stretched
 tight.<br>
 Push the balloon down with your fist and hold it down for one minute.<br>
 Raise your fist and take off the balloon to see a cloud formed in the 
 jar.<br>
 Your fist compressed the air in the jar to warm it and absorb more
water vapour.<br>
 When you remove the balloon cover, the air cools and some of the water
 vapour condenses on the chalk dust to form cloud.<br>
3. Use a big bottle with a one-hole stopper fixed 
 with a 10 cm length of glass tubing.<br>
 Put 3 cm of warm water in the bottle and drop chalk dust into the air 
 inside the bottle.<br>
 Connect the end of the glass tubing to a bicycle pump with rubber tubing.<br>
 Hold the stopper tight in the bottle and pump air in.<br>
 When the air becomes compressed inside the bottle, close the rubber 
tubing with a strong clamp and remove the bicycle pump.<br>
 Keep a tight hold on the stopper and open the clamp to let air blow 
out through the glass tubing.<br>
 A cloud forms in the bottle.<br>
 When the air comes out of the bottle, the air left in the bottle expands
 and cools, reducing the temperature in the bottle below the dew 
 point.<br>
 The moisture then condenses and forms a cloud.<br>
 Similarly, when warm air rises above the Earth the air pressure is
reduced.<br>
 The air expands and cools, and clouds form when the cooling goes below
 the dew point.<br>
4. Make a better cloud by using smoke instead of 
 chalk dust or by dropping a lighted match into the bottle.<br>
The smoke or lighted match provides small particles of the carbon that float in the air and act as condensation cores as steam sticks to them and condenses to water.<br>
5. Pour several mL water in a bottle, cover the 
 bottle tightly with a rubber stopper on which a hole is punched.<br>
Insert a short glass tube into the stopper, then connect the pump used to pump the bike with the glass tube on the stopper by a piece of rubber tube and short glass tube.<br>
 The mouth in the pump should be removed first.<br>
 Pump air to the bottle and let the students observe the phenomenon
in the bottle, especially at the moment that the stopper jumps up 
 suddenly.<br>
 If it is not easy to observe clearly, you may throw a lighted piece 
of match in the bottle, then a little fog appears in the bottle.<br>
 Repeat the step, much fog will appear.<br>
When the stopper jumps up suddenly, the volume of the air in the bottle increase suddenly leading to reduce the pressure in the bottle, and the temperature decreases with it.<br>
 This results in the evaporation of water and cool condensation later.<br>
 The reason that the burning match can make the process of condensation
 faster is due to the burning match provided the small 
 particles of the carbon.<br>
 It is these small solid particles floating in the air that acted as 
a condensation core to cause the water steam sticks to them and 
 condenses.<br>
 The experiment shows why it is easy to produce fog and rain in the
areas contaminated.<br>
 For example, in those cities of heavy industry there are more fog days
 than the non-industrial cities.<br>
