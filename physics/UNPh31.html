<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="31.1.02H"></a>31.1.02 Triboelectric series, electrostatic series, ranking of insulators<br>
 Produce static charge by rubbing or touching, contact charging.<br>
 The triboelectric series is a list of items sorted according to polarity of charge produced by rubbing.<br>
 Rub together any two of the substances in the triboelectric series.<br>
 The substance higher in the list will lose electrons to become positively charged.<br>
 The substance lower on the list will gain electrons and become negatively charged.<br>
 For example, if rub glass (6) with silk (14), glass becomes positive and silk becomes negative.<br>
 If rub ebonite (25) with wool (9), ebonite becomes negative and wool becomes positive.<br>
 If rub Perspex (23) with wool (9), Perspex becomes negative and wool becomes positive.<br>
 The further apart the materials the greater the charge produced.<br>
 The relative polarity depends on the specimen's molecular structure and the nature of the surface of that specimen.<br>
 The list below is a composite list from several authorities with no two lists in complete agreement.<br>
 If substances are touched instead of being vigorously rubbed, the sequence may change.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="31.1.03H">31.1.03</a> Electrostatics and humidity<br>
Detecting electrostatic charge, sand bath drying oven<br>
Electrostatics experiments may not work if the equipment is damp or stored in a damp place or if the humidity is high.<br>
In some countries electrostatics experiments may not work at all during the humid summer months, so teach electrostatics in the winter months when humidity is low is best.<br>
Some equipment, e.g. electrophorus, works better if first dried in front of a radiator.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="31.1.1H">31.1.1</a> Electrostatics, static electricity<br>
1. Thales of Miletus, 636-546 BC, Greece, observed that amber rubbed with wood attracts pieces of fluff and fragments of straw.<br>
The amber had become electrically charged.<br>
electricity, (Greek <i>ēlektron</i> amber)<br>
In 1600, William Gilbert, England, found that many substances rubbed together attract other substances.<br>
In 1733, Charles du Fay, France discovered two different "types" of electricity, which he called "vitreous electricity" when glass is rubbed with silk, and "resinous electricity', when amber is rubbed with fur.<br>
After observing and doing electricity experiments in 1746, Benjamin Franklin, America, renamed vitreous charge as positive charge and resinous electricity as negative charge.<br>
Why he used this positive and negative convention is not known, but since then it has never been changed.<br>
Nowadays, we say that when a glass rod is rubbed with a silk cloth, electrons are lost from the atoms in the glass and transferred to atoms in the silk cloth, leaving the glass rod with more positive than negative charge, and so a net positive charge.<br>
The convention is that a glass rod rubbed with silk has a net positive electrical charge.<br>
2. Electrostatics is the study of charges, mainly at rest, on non-conductors and the effects it creates.<br>
Electric charge can be either positive or negative and a neutral atom has equal quantities of positive and negative charge.<br>
 Like charges repel each other and opposite charges attract each other.<br>
Electrification is the process by which an object becomes electrically charged.<br>
The two forms of electrical charge are positive and negative.<br>
When two electrically charged objects are placed near each other, they exert a force on each other.<br>
If the objects have the same charge then they will repel and if they carry different charges, they will attract each other.<br>
So bodies with like charges repel each other and bodies with unlike charges attract each other.<br>
The nature of a static charge is due to an excess or shortage of electrons so the "natural unit" of electric charge should be the charge on an electron.<br>
 A negatively charged body contains more electrons than protons.<br>
 A positively charged body contains fewer electrons than protons.<br>
 Use simple electrostatic generation and testing equipment to show the nature of attraction, repulsion and induction laws.<br>
 Electrostatic charge refers to electric charge at rest on the surface of an insulator or insulated conductor.<br>
 Electrostatic charge has an associated electric field, E.<br>
3. An object becomes electrically charged when it either loses or gains electrons.<br>
 When most plastics are rubbed with wool, negative charge is taken off the wool.<br>
 So the wool loses electrons leaving it positively charged and the plastic gains electrons leaving it negatively charged.<br>
 However, when perspex is rubbed with wool, negative charge is taken of the perspex.<br>
 So the perspex loses electrons, leaving it positively charged and the wool gains electrons, leaving it negatively charged.<br>
4. An object is electrically charged when there is a difference between the number of positive and negative charges, so there is a net charge on the object.<br>
 An object with ten positive charges and eight negative charges carries a net positive charge.<br>
 An object can never lose or gain positive charges, because only negatively charged electrons can be transferred between objects.<br>
 Conservation of charge refers to the fact that in a closed system the charge always remains the same and the charge in the universe always remains the same.<br>
5. Conductor allow charges to move over them or through them, e.g. metals.<br>
 Insulators do not allow charges to move over them or through, e.g. plastics.<br>
 Experiment<br>
 Use antistatic paper to stop static cling on television screens, sewing thread, panty hose, Venetian blinds and to collect cat hair.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="31.1.2H">31.1.2</a> Aluminium balls on gramophone record<br>
Experiment<br>
 1. Use aluminium foil or "silver paper" to cut out the shape of a soccer player and make a soccer ball.<br>
 Attach it to the edge of an old 78 rpm gramophone record.<br>
 Rub the record with wool cloth and put it on an inverted drinking glass.<br>
 Put a tin sheet from a jam tin in front of the player.<br>
 Attach a thread to the aluminium foil soccer ball.<br>
 Hold the thread so that the ball is suspended near the foot of the player.<br>
 The extra electrons on the record spread into the player and attract the ball that has no charge.<br>
 The ball touches the foot of the player, receives extra electrons, then is forced away from the player, because player and ball are now negatively charged.<br>
 The ball hits the tin sheet, loses its electrons and becomes attracted to the player again.<br>
2. Rub an old gramophone record with wool and put it on glass.<br>
 Drop small aluminium foil balls onto the gramophone record.<br>
 They jump from the gramophone record in all directions.<br>
 Static electricity produced by rubbing is irregular.<br>
 The aluminium balls take up the negative charges and are repelled, but they are attracted to positive charges still on the gramophone record.<br>
3. Use aluminium foil or "silver paper" to make little balls to represent grasshoppers.<br>
 Rub an old 78 rpm gramophone record with wool and sprinkle the little aluminium balls onto the record.<br>
 The grasshoppers will they will jump away from each other, because they have the same charge.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="31.1.3H"></a>31.1.3 Aluminium foil precipitator<br>
<a href="../images/31.9.29.gif">See diagram 31.9.29</a>: Electrostatic precipitator.<br>
 In an electrostatic precipitator smoke and other particles become charged when they pass by sharp pointed electrodes inside the chimney.<br>
 The charged particles are removed by charged plates near the mouth of the chimney.<br>
Experiment<br>
 Build a simulation experiment to show the action of an electrostatic precipitator.<br>
 The outer electrode is a cylinder of aluminium foil inside the walls of the jar.<br>
 Turn on the aquarium pump.<br>
 Air passes hydrogen chloride gas from the hydrochloric acid to react with the concentrated ammonia solution from the next test-tube to form a smoke of ammonium chloride.<br>
 Notice the amount of smoke from the chimney.<br>
 Gradually increase the flow of air from the pump then turn on the induction coil to supply the high voltage.<br>
 Note any change in the smoke from the chimney.<br>
 Adjust the air flow by constricting the tube from the air pump.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="31.1.4H">31.1.4</a> Attract water to a comb<br>
Experiment<br>
1. Attract water to a comb.<br>
 Adjust a tap so that a very thin stream of water flows from it.<br>
 Give a comb a charge by running it through the hair several times.<br>
 Hold the comb 2 cm from the stream of water.<br>
 The water is strongly attracted by the electrical charge on the comb.<br>
2. Turn on a tap so that a thin continuous stream of water flows.<br>
 Charge a comb by combing your hair several times.<br>
 The friction between you hair and the comb cause excess electrons on the comb so it becomes negatively charged.<br>
 Hold the comb near the stream of water where it comes out of the tap.<br>
 The comb attracts the water, because of the negative electrical charges 
on the comb attract positive charges in the water molecules.<br>
The charges on the water molecules inside the water stream neutralize each other, but the charges on the surface of the stream opposite the comb cannot be neutralized, so the side of the stream opposite the comb is attracted to the comb pulling the rest of the stream along with it.<br>
3. Repeat the experiment using "Golden Syrup" or treacle or thin honey instead of water.<br>
4. Bend water with static electricity<br>
Turn on the faucet and slowly turn down the water until a very thin stream of water flows.<br>
Brush a plastic comb through your hair ten times.<br>
Slowly bring the comb close the flowing water, without touching the water.<br>
The stream of water bend towards the comb.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="31.1.5H">31.1.5</a> Balloon charge<br>
<a href="../images/31.2.3.1.gif">See diagram 31.2.3.1</a>: Balloon charge.<br>
Experiment<br>
 1. Suspend two equally charged balloons by triangular suspension.<br>
 The forces on one balloon are as follows: F electric force, T tension in string, mg weight of a balloon.<br>
 Measure the distance d to the vertical and then weigh a balloon mg.<br>
 F / mg = d / sqrt (s<sup>2</sup> - d<sup>2</sup>).<br>
2. Fill a toy balloon with air and tie the necks tightly.<br>
 Rub the balloon with wool.<br>
 Attach the rubbed part to a wooden door.<br>
 The balloon will still stay there.<br>
 Rub the balloon against a woollen sweater then attach the rubbed part to a student's face.<br>
 The air balloon will also stay there.<br>
 Some electrons have been rubbed from the wool onto the balloon to give it a negative charge.<br>
 These electrons repel the electrons nearby on the wooden door or student's face and these charges are then attracted to the positive charges left on the door.<br>
 The balloon will stick to any uncharged surface, but the charge will gradually leave the balloon especially if the humidity is high or if placed under running water.<br>
 The balloons filled with air will stick to the ceiling for hours, because they are attracted to the uncharged ceiling.<br>
 After some time the extra electrons on the balloons pass to the ceiling so the balloons no longer kiss the ceiling.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="31.1.6H">31.1.6</a> Balloon stays in place<br>
Experiment<br>
 Blow up a toy balloon and rub it with a piece of fur.<br>
 Place it against the wall and note that it stays where you place it.<br>
 Repeat the experiment by rubbing the balloon on your hair.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="31.1.7H">31.1.7</a> Body sparks, rug scuffing<br>
Experiment<br>
 1. Separating charge in common ways to separate charges, e.g. scuff a rug and then discharge through a neon bulb.<br>
 Identify charges with an electroscope charged with known sign to test other charged objects.<br>
2. Walk on a carpet or rug made of synthetic fibres while wearing rubber shoes.<br>
 Electrons are attracted from the carpet and spread across the body.<br>
 When a metal rail or a door handle is touched, some electrons will jump away from the fingers as a small spark.<br>
 Touch the metal again.<br>
 Nothing happens, because the fingers are no longer charged.<br>
3. Hold a fluorescent lamp tube while rubbing the shoes strongly on the carpet.<br>
 Keep hold of the tube and touch the other end on a metal railing.<br>
 The fluorescent tube produces a brief flash of light.<br>
4. Comb the hair vigorously on a day when the humidity is low.<br>
 Your hair may stand on end!<br>
5. Pull off a woolly jumper over a silk shirt.<br>
 On a very dry day listen for a crackling sound!<br>
6. Motor car tyres can pick up extra electrons
form the ground that spread through the car and cover the body.<br>
 On a cold dry day, drivers may get out of the car and experience a slight electric shock when the extra electrons jump back to earth.<br>
 The car builds up an electrical charge and "earths", i.e. flows through the driver, when the driver steps onto the ground.<br>
 The driver act as an electrical conductor and so gets an electrical shock.<br>
 Some vehicles, e.g. petrol tankers, have a chain or a metalled strip always touching the ground to get rid of extra electrons picked up by the tyres from the road.<br>
 The vehicles are always "earthed".<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="31.1.8H">31.1.8</a> Coin stays on the cupboard door<br>
Experiment<br>
 This experiment can work on unpainted wood, but it works best on waxed surfaces.<br>
 Rub a coin up and down on the cupboard door with a brisk action.<br>
 Remove you hand and the coin stays on the vertical door.<br>
 The rubbing action causes increased pressure and friction so that the air under the coin becomes hotter and expands.<br>
 Some of this hotter air leaks out from under the coin as it moves across the surface of the cupboard door.<br>
 When you stop rubbing, the remaining air under the coin cools and contracts causing a partial vacuum.<br>
 So the atmospheric pressure on the outside of the coin is greater than the pressure of air under the coin and the coin stays pressed against the cupboard door.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="31.1.9H">31.1.9</a> Comb attracts and repels, bent water stream, air cleaner<br>
Experiment<br>
 1. Pull a sheet of tissue paper, e.g. toilet tissue, Kleenex, into very small pieces and let them fall onto a sheet of plastic.<br>
 Rub a comb very vigorously with the sleeve of a woollen jumper.<br>
 Bring the charged comb close to the paper.<br>
 The comb attracts the light paper.<br>
 A charged comb causes bits of light paper to become polarized such that the sides nearest the comb get a charge opposite the charge on the comb.<br>
 So an attractive interaction between the comb and the bits of paper occurs.<br>
 The bits of tissue paper at first stick to the comb, but later they fall off or shoot off the comb as the charge on the comb is distributed around the surface of the bits of paper.<br>
2. Rub a comb or plastic ruler vigorously with wool.<br>
 Bring it near a ping-pong ball on a smooth table.<br>
 The charged comb attracts the uncharged ping-pong ball.<br>
 Let the comb touch the ping-pong ball.<br>
4. Bring the charged comb to a bowl of puffed wheat or puffed rice.<br>
 They are at first attracted to the comb then shoot off.<br>
5. Adjust the water tap to give a thin stream of water.<br>
 Comb the hair or rub the comb with wool.<br>
 Bring the comb close to the thin stream of water.<br>
 The water stream bends towards the comb as the negatively charged comb attracts the neutral water.<br>
 Let the water touch the comb.<br>
 The comb loses its charge to the water and can no longer attract a water stream.<br>
6. To show deflection of a water stream, rub a plastic spoon with wool, turn the tap on gently and hold the spoon near the fine stream.<br>
 The falling water is pulled towards the spoon.<br>
 The plastic spoon becomes negatively charged, because electrons are rubbed off the wool.<br>
 The plastic spoon attracts the uncharged water particles.<br>
 When the water touches the spoon it can no longer attract a water stream, because the extra electrons flow onto the water surface from the spoon.<br>
7. Use a comb as an air cleaner.<br>
 Rub a comb with wool.<br>
 Wave the comb through the air then look at the teeth of the comb with a magnifier.<br>
 See the dust from the air now attracted to the comb.<br>
 This method is used to clean smoke in chimneys by "scrubbers", which attract dust by electrostatic attraction.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="31.1.10H">31.1.10</a> Comb on a turntable<br>
Experiment<br>
 Make a turntable for electrostatic experiments to study the two kinds of static charge.<br>
 Put the top of an inverted test-tube into the centre hole of a big cork or a rubber stopper.<br>
 Hammer four pins symmetrically into the cork's upper plane without destroying the balance of the cork.<br>
 A swivel can be used in many static electricity experiments.<br>
 Use it to show that like charges repel each other.<br>
 Put a plastic comb, after being rubbed against a piece of pelt, on the swivel table and make the comb's centre of gravity coincide with the centre of the cork.<br>
 Then observe the rotation of the comb on the swivel table when another comb, after being rubbed against a piece of pelt, close up the comb on the swivel table.<br>

 See: <a href="Commercial3.html#Electrostatics">Ebonite rod</a>, (Commercial).<br>
 See: <a href="Commercial3.html#Faraday">Glass Rod</a>, (Commercial).<br>
Experiment<br>
 1. Ebonite rod rubbed with wool becomes negative, because electrons leave the wool and stick on the surface of the ebonite.<br>
 Rub two ebonite rods with wool.<br>
 Suspend one rod.<br>
 Bring the other rod near it.<br>
 Note the repulsion.<br>
2. Glass rod rubbed with silk becomes positive because electrons leave the glass and stick to the surface of the silk.<br>
 Note that glass rods dried in the flame of a Bunsen burner may become negative when rubbed with silk.<br>
 However, glass rods dried in a sand oven always become positive when rubbed with silk.<br>
 Lead glass may charge better than soda glass.<br>
 Use glass rods dried in a sand bath oven.<br>
 Rub the ends of glass rods with silk.<br>
 Suspend one rod so that it hangs horizontally.<br>
 Bring the rubbed end other rod near it.<br>
 Note the repulsion as the suspended rod moves away.<br>
 Note the force of attraction between the rubbed ends of both glass rods and the silk.<br>
 With one charged rod on a pivot use another of the same or opposite charge to show attraction or repulsion.<br>
3. Suspend a charged ebonite rod.<br>
 Bring a charged glass rod near it.<br>
 Note the repulsion.<br>
 Suspend a charged ebonite rod.<br>
 Pass another charged rod gently through the hand then bring it near the suspended rod.<br>
 Note there is no repulsion.<br>
 Rub this uncharged rod on the back of the hand.<br>
 Bring it near the suspended rod.<br>
 Note the repulsion.<br>
 Rubbing on the skin has recharged the rod.<br>
 Pass the charged rod quickly through a Bunsen burner flame.<br>
 Bring it near the suspended rod and note its loss of charge.<br>
4. Fit a brass or other metal tube over the end of an uncharged ebonite rod.<br>
 Rub the brass tube only with fur.<br>
 Bring it near a suspended charged rod of ebonite.<br>
 Note the repulsion.<br>
 The brass is also negatively charged.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="31.1.16H">31.1.16</a> Electric charge, conventions from effects of friction between substances<br>
 By convention, a rubber rod rubbed with fur has negative electrical charge.<br>
 A glass rod rubbed with silk has a positive electrical charge.<br>
 An uncharged body has equal amounts of positive charge and negative charge.<br>
Experiment<br>
 1. Rub a rubber rod with fur.<br>
 Suspend two pith balls so that they hang parallel and vertically.<br>
 Touch separately the two suspended pith balls with the rubbed rubber rod.<br>
 Bring the two pith balls together.<br>
 They swing apart, so a repulsive force now exists between them.<br>
 Rub the wool felt cloth on a PVC rod to produce negative charge on the rod.<br>
 Rub the cellophane on an acrylic rod to produce positive charge on the rod.<br>
2. Rub a glass rod with a silk cloth.<br>
 Suspend two pith balls so that they hang parallel and vertically.<br>
 Touch separately the two suspended pith balls with the glass rod.<br>
 Bring the two pith balls together.<br>
 They swing apart, so a repulsive force now exists between them.<br>
 Bring together one of each pair of pith balls.<br>
 They swing together, so an attractive force now exists between them.<br>
3. Rub a glass rod with a silk cloth then bring it near an insulated conductor.<br>
The silk is now negatively charged and the glass is positively charged, so the side of the insulated conductor nearest the glass rod is negatively charged and the side of the insulated conductor away from the glass rod is positively charged.<br>
 The total charge on the insulated conductor is unaltered.<br>
 If the original charge on the insulated conductor was zero then it is still zero.<br>
 Verify these charges with a proof plane, an aluminum-covered conductive disc attached to an insulated handle.<br>
 It is used to sample the charge density on charged conductive surfaces.<br>
 By touching the insulated conductor at different points, it will be the same potential as that point and this can be verified with an electroscope.<br>
4. Inflate a party balloon and tie it shut very tightly.<br>
 Rub the balloon vigorously on the head of a person with dry, non-oily hair.<br>
 Touch the balloon on a fluorescent light bulb.<br>
 The bulb gives off a "ghostly" glow when electrons from the balloon flow into it to excite the phosphorus coating and produce light.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="31.1.17H">31.1.17</a> Electric charge movement, charging by induction<br>
<a href="../images/31.5.13.gif">See diagram 31.5.13</a>: Charging by induction.<br>
 1. An electric current is a flow of electrons.<br>
 An electron carries one negative basic charge and a proton carries one positive basic charge.<br>
 The original positive charge is the charge on a glass rod when rubbed with silk.<br>
 Taking away electrons forms a positive charge on an object.<br>
 Adding electrons forms a negative charge on an object.<br>
2. A flow of electric charge is associated with the following:<br>
Heating effects,<br>
Lighting effects,<br>
Resistance, conductors and insulators,<br>
The motor effect,<br>
The electrolysis process,<br>
Magnetic effects,<br>
Currents in nerve tissue.<br>
3. Electric charge can be either positive or negative, and a neutral atom has equal quantities of positive and negative charge.<br>
 Like charges repel each other.<br>
 Unlike charges attract each other.<br>
 Rubbing a plastic bag with wool takes electrons from the wool to leave the plastic bag negatively charged and wool positively charged.<br>
4. Insulators do not allow charges to move over their surface or through them, so any charge remains on the surface.<br>
 Conductors allow charges to move over their surface or through them.<br>
5. Bring a charged object near a metal conductor.<br>
 The like charge is repelled along the metal conductor to the far end, and the end near the charged object is left with opposite charge.<br>
 Charges separated in this way are called induced charges.<br>
6. The testing for type of charge is repulsion by a like charge.<br>
 If an isolated conductor has charges induced on it, the charge that is repelled can be made to go to earth by touching the conductor briefly with a finger.<br>
 The opposite charge will be left on the conductor.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="31.1.19H">31.1.19</a> Faraday's ice pail experiment<br>
 See: <a href="Commercial3.html#Faraday">Faraday pail</a>, (Commercial).<br>
<a href="31.1.4.png">See diagram 31.1.4</a>: Faraday's ice pail experiment, (Wikipedia).<br>
The experiment shows how charge is distributed over a metal conductor and how electrostatic induction occurs.<br>
A metal sphere, C, is given a net negative charge.<br>
An ice pail, A (metal ice bucket), on an insulated stand, B, is electrically neutral, having charges evenly distributed over its inner and outer surfaces.<br>
The metal sphere is lowered completely into the ice pail so as not to touch the sides.<br>
The negative charges on the surface of the metal sphere repel the free electrons from the inside to the outside of the ice pail, where the excess electrons move down a wire connected to a gold leaf electroscope, E.<br>
So now the inside of the ice pail has a net positive charge and the leaves of the gold leaf electroscope are displaced.<br>
The induced charge on the electroscope is the same size as the inducing charge on the metal sphere.<br>
If the metal sphere touches the inside of the ice pail, charges move between them and the metal sphere and inside of the ice pail become electrically neutral.<br>
However, when the metal sphere is then removed from inside the ice pail, the leaves of the gold leaf electroscope remain displaced, because the outside of the ice pail keeps the same charge.<br>
Experiment<br>
1. To show the equality of charges, rub a rubber rod against a similar rod covered with wool and insert them separately and together in the ice pail.<br>
2. Charge the sphere several times by rubbing a charged rod on its surface.<br>
 Touch the proof plane to the outside of the sphere and then to the electroscope.<br>
 The electroscope charges, indicating there is a charge on the outside of the sphere.<br>
 Repeat the same test on the inside of the sphere.<br>
 The electroscope does not charge.<br>
