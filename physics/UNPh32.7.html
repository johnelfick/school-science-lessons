Instructions<br>
Be careful! Never short-circuit an automotive battery.<br>
Excessive current demand may cause battery acid to boil out.<br>
1. Keep the battery case clean.<br>
Use hot soapy water then make it perfectly dry.<br>
Clean the battery terminals at vehicle service.<br>
2. Remove filler caps and check the electrolyte 
level each month.<br>
Fill the battery with deionized water or distilled water to just
 above the battery plates.<br>
Do not overfill.<br>
Mop and dry any spillage of water.<br>
3. The battery must be secure in its cradle.<br>
Vibrations of the battery can damage the battery plates.<br>
Loose or corrodes battery terminals may cause breakdowns.<br>
4. The battery will run down without regular use.<br>
It runs down quicker if use is infrequent or used only for short
 runs.<br>
To avoid problems make sure that the battery is regularly recharged 
 and tested.<br>
5. If battery is drained, because of leaving lights 
on revive it with a slow charge.<br>
Under-charging and over-charging will shorten battery life.<br>
6. Poor engine condition will shorten the life of
a battery.<br>
7. When working on a battery, do not smoke or have 
a naked flame nearby, because batteries produce hydrogen gas.<br>
8. Before trying to jump start by pushing the car 
or using jump start cables, make sure that you understand the electrical 
design of that 
 particular make of car.<br>
 Do not try to jump start a car fitted with electronic systems, but get expert assistance.<br>

<a href="./images/32.5.3.2.gif">See diagram 32.5.3.2</a>: Lead-acid battery secondary cell.<br>
 Lead acid battery<br>
 The lead acid battery is a group of two or more electric cells
 connected in series.<br>
 A 12 volt battery has six 2 volts cells.<br>
 A 6 volt battery has three 2 volt cells.<br>
 Secondary cells, which can be recharged many times, are also called 
 storage cells or accumulators.<br>
 The chemical action can be reversed by passing a current through
 the cell in the direction opposite to the discharge current until the 
 chemicals have been changed back to their original form, the cell 
 is charged again.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">6 volt battery<br>
 The 6 volt battery has three identical lead-acid cells connected in 
series, so their voltage is added.<br>
 The current is the same in all cells.<br>
 Charging or discharging current must pass through all the cells 
in the battery.<br>
 The positive and negative plates correspond to the positive and 
negative electrodes of a primary cell.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Battery plates<br>
 These thin plates expose a large surface to the action of the electrolyte.<br>
 The plates are constructed from a lead-antimony grid filled with
 lead (IV) oxide, PbO, in the positive plate and a spongy form of pure 
 grey lead (Pb) in the negative plate.<br>
 Separators are insulators to prevent contact between the plates 
and allow circulation of the electrolyte, a dilute solution of sulfuric 
acid 
 in water.<br>
 The order of plates within the cell is negative plate, separator, 
 positive plate, separator with the final plate in the series a negative 
 plate.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Voltage<br>
 The voltage (emf ) of a lead-acid cell varies from 2.3 volts when the 
 cell is fully charged to 1.9 volts, when the cell is fully discharged.<br>
 A voltmeter connected to the battery terminals of a discarded battery 
 containing some liquid will still show some reading.<br>
 When a lead cell accumulator is fully charged, the concentration
 of sulfuric acid is at maximum.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Electrolyte<br>
 When the accumulator is fully discharged, "flat battery", the concentration 
 of sulfuric acid is at a minimum.<br>
 A battery hydrometer is used to read the relative density (specific 
 gravity) of the sulfuric acid in the electrolyte and check the charge of 
 the battery.<br>
 The density varies from about 1.28 in a fully charged battery to
 1.15 in a discharged battery.<br>
 The density of sulfuric acid purchased for use in accumulators
is about 1.25 at 20<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="32.7.10H">32.7.10</a> Discharging and 
 charging a battery<br>
 Discharging ---&gt;<br>
 PbO + 2H2SO4 + Pb ---&gt; 2PbSO4 + 2H2O<br>
 &lt;--- Charging<br>
 Lead (IV) oxide + sulfuric acid + lead ---&gt; lead sulfate + water<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Discharging<br>
 When the battery is discharging, lead (IV) oxide in the positive
 plate combines with sulfuric acid (sulfuric acid) in the electrolyte
to form 
 lead sulfate (lead sulfate) and water.<br>
 Lead in the negative plate combines with sulfuric acid to form
lead sulfate and water.<br>
 How much lead sulfate is produced is directly proportional to how 
 much current flows.<br>
 The electrolyte not only takes part in the conversion of the stored 
 chemical energy to an electric current, but also provides a low 
 resistance path for the current through the cell.<br>
 The battery is discharged when not enough sulfuric acid is left 
in the electrolyte for effective chemical action and most of the active 
 materials, lead (IV) oxide and lead, in both sets of plates have
 been converted into lead sulfate.<br>
 During discharge the electrolyte becomes weaker as the acid combines
 with the plates.<br>
 The lead sulfate that has formed fills the pores of the plates
so circulation of the electrolyte decreases and the voltage of the battery 
 drops.<br>
 The battery is fully discharged when the electrolyte cannot reach 
 the remaining active material of the plates and react with it fast enough 
 to maintain the working voltage and produce an effective current.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Charging<br>
 When the battery is charging, current passes through the battery
 in the reverse direction to the flow on discharge to reverse the 
 chemical reactions and reform the dark brown lead (IV) oxide on 
the positive plates and spongy lead on the negative plates.<br>
 When the battery is fully charged, the specific gravity of the
electrolyte is restored to its original value.<br>
 If electricity is passed through the battery after it is fully
charged then more electrical energy is being supplied to the battery
than can be 
 converted to chemical energy.<br>
 The excess electricity decomposes the water in the electrolyte
to form hydrogen gas and oxygen, called "gassing".<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="32.7.6H">32.7.6</a> Cell connections 
 of a lead cell battery<br>
<a href="./images/32.5.3.4.gif">See diagram 32.5.3.4</a> Cell connections
 of 6 volt batteries.<br>
 The lead-acid cell has a voltage of two volts when in average working 
 condition.<br>
 Each cell has two terminals, the positive terminal and the negative 
 terminal.<br>
 Inside the cell, the positive terminal is connected to the positive 
 plates and the negative terminal to the negative plates.<br>
 The direction of conventional current flow is from the positive 
terminal to the negative terminal in the circuit outside the cell.<br>
 The movement of current carrying particles, i.e. electrons, is
in the opposite direction.<br>
 In most of the electrical devices on motor vehicles it does not 
matter which way the current flows.<br>
 In most motor vehicles the negative terminal of the battery is
connected to earth, so the current flows from the insulated live side
of the 
 circuit down through the appliance to earth.<br>
 However, in motor vehicles using alternators and rectifiers a wrong 
 connection can cause damage.<br>
 A 6 volt battery has three 2 volt cells connected in series.<br>
 To simplify connection, the centre cell is placed in the container
 the opposite way round to the end cells.<br>
 Two complete 6 volt batteries form a 12 volt battery.<br>
 Two batteries may be connected in parallel for heavy duty operation.<br>
 Two identical batteries connected in parallel give the voltage
of only one battery, but their capacity is double the capacity of each.<br>
 An extra battery may be connected in parallel with the battery
in a vehicle to start the engine.<br>
 If a battery is put on charge with its negative terminal connected
 to the positive terminal of the charger, the battery may be badly 
 damaged by reversal of the polarity of the plates.<br>
 If the name plate is facing the observer, the positive terminal 
will be at the front right hand corner.<br>
 Reverse assembly, the positive terminal will be at the front left 
 hand corner.<br>
 The polarity of each individual cell can be found with a moving 
coil permanent magnet voltmeter with its terminals marked.<br>
 The positive post may be painted red, or becomes a dark chocolate 
 colour after a very short period of use.<br>
 The negative terminal always looks cleaner and remains light grey 
 in colour.<br>
 Each inter cell connector becomes discoloured in the same way, 
one end dark brown and the other end light grey.<br>
 The dark brown end is connected to the positive terminal of a cell, 
 and the light grey end is connected to the negative terminal of the 
 adjacent cell.<br>
 A lead-acid battery may self-discharge at the rate of 1% of its 
capacity per day.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="32.7.15H">32.7.15</a> State of charge of a motor vehicle battery<br>
<a href="./images/32.5.3.5.gif">See diagram 32.5.3.5</a>: Battery hydrometer.<br>
 There is no direct method to measure a battery's state of charge.
 Static voltage<br>
 Measure its static voltage and compare it to a standardized chart.<br>
 This is the least accurate method, but it only involves an inexpensive
 digital meter.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Amp-hour meter<br>
 Measure with an amp-hour meter which monitors all power moving in and 
out of the battery by time, and the state of charge is 
 determined by comparing flow rates.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Electrolyte density<br>
 Measure the density, specific gravity, of the sulfuric acid electrolyte
 with a battery hydrometer.<br>
 This is the most accurate test, but yet it is only applicable to flooded
 lead-acid batteries.<br>
 Electrolyte density is lower when the battery is discharged and 
higher as the cells are charged.<br>
 The battery's chemical reactions affect the density of the electrolyte
 at a constant rate that is predictable enough to get a good 
 indication of the cell's state of charge.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2">Maintenance free batteries<br>
 They are supplied to some modern motor vehicles under normal operation 
conditions will not need water addition within its average 
 battery life.<br>
 The vent caps remain sealed and the electrolyte cannot be tested
 as explained below.<br>
 However, the vent caps are accessible for inspection of fluid level 
 in the battery if required when using the battery under abnormal 
 operating conditions.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Battery hydrometer<br>
 For battery testing, the hydrometer floats in a syringe.<br>
 The electrolyte is drawn into a glass tube so that level can be 
observed in relation to the scale marked on the narrow stem of the 
 hydrometer.<br>
 Always take readings at eye level, i.e. your line of sight must 
be horizontal.<br>
 The battery hydrometer indicates the state of charge of each cell.<br>
 The electrolyte expands when heated and contracts when cooled so
 a reference temperature standard is needed.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">State of charge<br>
 The specific gravity, SG, of the electrolyte in each cell of a battery 
 shows the battery's state of charge:<br>
 Fully charged, SG = 1.280. Three quarter charged, SG = 1.240, Half
 charged, SG = 1.200, Quarter charged, SG = 1.160,<br>
 Discharged, SG = 1.120.<br>
 The state of charge of a battery is not a true indication of its internal 
 condition if the battery has any bulging, cracking, leakage of 
 electrolyte, or lifting of the cell covers at the positive post 
end.<br>
 Check that you have enough electrolyte above the plates to make 
a hydrometer test then read the specific gravity of the electrolyte in 
 each cell.<br>
 If any reading is below 1.225, the battery has been recharged following 
 the manufacturer's instructions.<br>
 A low reading in one or more cells after the battery has been recharged 
 indicates internal trouble.<br>
 Test the ability of the battery to do the work required of it by
 drawing the normal starter motor current and measuring the voltage of
 the 
 individual cells while they are discharging at a high rate with 
an accurate voltmeter.<br>
 No cell should read less than 1.5 volts.<br>
 As the cells of a battery are connected in series, each receives
 the same charging current and the same amount of current also flows 
 through each on discharge.<br>
 If the cell voltages do not fall below 1.5 volts while the starter
 is being operated and the specific gravity readings are at least 1.250, 
 the 
 battery is in good condition.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="32.7.13H">32.7.13</a> Prepare lead-acid 
 battery electrolyte, accumulator electrolyte<br>
 1. Prepare electrolyte for a lead cell accumulator<br>
 <b>Be careful!</b> Use safety glasses and nitrile chemical-resistant
 gloves!<br>
 Follow the recommendations of the manufacturers for filling 
and initial charging that is usually printed on the battery.<br>
 The relative densities of the sulfuric acid in the battery
are as follows:<br>
 Fully-charged 1.28, Half-charged 1.21, Discharged 1.15.
 To make a solution of sulfuric acid, relative density 1.28, slowly
 add concentrated sulfuric acid to a strong beaker two-thirds full of 
 demineralized water, until the solution is almost boiling.<br>
 Leave to cool and add more acid until the solution almost boils.<br>
 Leave to cool to room temperature.<br>
 Adjust the relative density by adding more acid or more water, 
according to the hydrometer reading.<br>
 When the cell is not in use, use a jar with a cover to prevent
drying by evaporation.<br>
 Use safety glasses and nitrile chemical-resistant gloves!<br>
 Slowly add concentrated sulfuric acid, with stirring, to a beaker 
 two thirds full of distilled water, until the solution is almost boils.<br>
 Leave to cool and add more acid until the solution almost boils.<br>
 After cooling to room temperature, adjust the relative density
with more acid or more water, according to a hydrometer reading.<br>
 Sulfuric acid is highly corrosive and if spilt on the skin must 
be washed off immediately with plenty of water from a running tap.<br>
 Apply baking soda solution to the affected area then wash off with
 water.<br>
 Keep a labelled jar of baking soda solution near by in case of
spills on the skin.<br>
 
2. The electrolyte used in lead-acid batteries
is a solution of chemically pure sulfuric acid in deionized water.<br>
 The efficiency and ultimate life of a battery depends on the purity 
 of the electrolyte.<br>
 Always use deionized water or, demineralized water or rainwater 
to maintain the level of electrolyte in the cells, topping up.<br>
 Do not add tap water or water that has been in contact with metals, 
 especially iron, because impurities cause secondary chemical 
 reactions and the battery can self-discharge.<br>
 Do not fill above an electrolyte marker or the top of the splash
 guards, just fill to cover the separators that extend upwards above
the 
 top edges of the plates.<br>
 The electrolyte should be able to expand and rise when warmed without 
 spilling out through the vent holes in the filler plugs.<br>
 <b>BE CAREFUL! REMEMBER: ACID TO WATER, NEVER
 WATER TO ACID!</b><br>
 
3. Charge the battery at the normal rate until
the specific gravity stops rising and the cells are gassing.<br>
 If the SG is too high, draw off some electrolyte with the battery 
 hydrometer syringe and replace it with deionized water or demineralized 
 water or rain water.<br>
 If the SG is too low, draw off some electrolyte and replace it
with 1.300 specific gravity acid.<br>
 Charge the battery for a further two hours after any replacement
 to mix the electrolyte thoroughly before taking another reading.<br>
 Use a clean glass container for mixing the electrolyte.<br>
 Put the water required into the container first then pour the acid
 slowly into the water while stirring.<br>
 Let the electrolyte cool to room temperature before taking the
final specific gravity reading.<br>
 Keep the battery and its surrounding parts clean and dry to avoid 
 corrosion of metal parts.<br>
 Overcharging may cause loosening and shedding of the active material
 from the plate grids.<br>
 The hot electrolyte may attack the separators and the life of the 
 battery will be very short.<br>
 
4. A battery is left for a long time in a partially
 discharged state is harder to recharge to its original capacity, because 
 the fine crystalline 
 lead sulfate may harden and become more dense, the battery becomes
 "sulfated".<br>
 To avoid sulfation, the generator must run long enough to restore 
 the chemical energy used to start the engine and operate the lights and 
 accessories while the engine is idle.<br>
 The internal resistance of the battery is higher when cold, and 
a short run may not raise the electrolyte temperature sufficiently to 
lower 
 its resistance, so the voltage regulator operates earlier in the
 charging cycle, and at a lower specific gravity than it would do normally.<br>
 Do not allow the electrolyte level to become too low to expose
the plates to the air, because oxygen in the air will combine with the 
 spongy lead of the negative plate to form a layer of lead (IV)
oxide.<br>
 
5. Always take great care when handling concentrated 
 acid.<br>
 Wear protective glasses and clothing.<br>
 To make a solution of sulfuric acid, relative density 1.28, slowly add concentrated
sulfuric acid to a strong beaker two-thirds full of 
 demineralized water, until the solution is almost boiling.<br>
 Allow the solution to cool, then add more acid until the solution is again
almost boiling.<br>
 Leave to cool to room temperature.<br>
 Adjust the relative density by the adding more acid or more water, according 
to the hydrometer reading.<br>
 When the cell is not in use, use a jar with a cover to prevent drying by
evaporation.<br>
 
6. Fix two lead foil strips in a beaker and add
 200 mL of 1 mol per litre sulfuric acid.
 Connect the lead electrodes to a power pack set at 2 V and switch it on
for two minutes.
 The lead strip connected to the positive terminal becomes covered with brown
lead dioxide.
 Disconnect the power pack and connect the lead strips to a torch battery.
 The battery glows, but the brown leads dioxide on the positive terminal does
not disappear.
 Repeat the experiment with increasing charging times.
 The time the battery glows increases with charging time up to 30 seconds 
then hardly changes.
 Repeat the experiment with different charging voltages.
 Different charging voltage makes hardly any difference in the time the battery
glows.
However, at high charging voltages hydrogen is produced at the negative electrode and oxygen at the positive electrode.
Charging<br>
At the positive electrode: Pb(s) + 2H2O(l) --&gt; PbO2(s) + 4H<sup>+</sup>(aq) + 4e<sup>-</sup><br>
At the negative electrode: 2H<sup>+</sup>(aq) + 2e<sup>-</sup> --&gt; H2(g)<br>
Also, lead reacts with the sulfuric acid to produce lead sulfate<br>
At the positive electrode: PbSO4(s) + 2H2O(l) --&gt; PbO2(s) + 4H<sup>+</sup>(aq) + SO4<sup>2-</sup> + 2e<sup>-</sup><br>
At the negative electrode: PbSO4(s) + 2e<sup>-</sup> --&gt; Pb(s) + SO4<sup>2-</sup>(aq)<br>
So sulfuric acid is produced during charging and is consumed during discharging. 
As sulfuric acid has about twice the density of water, the density of the electrolyte shows the state of charge of the battery.
 
7. When the battery is fully charged, the specific
 gravity = 1.280, electrode A is lead and electrode, B is lead dioxide.<br>
 When the battery is discharging, electrode A changes from lead to lead sulfate, 
electrode, B changes from lead dioxide to lead sulfate, 
 and the concentration of sulfuric acid decreases.<br>
 When the battery is being charged, these processes are reversed.<br>
 The concentration of sulfuric acid suggests the state of charge of the battery
so this concentration can be measured with a battery 
 hydrometer.<br>
 Electrode A: Pb + SO4<sup>2-</sup> --&gt; PbSO4 + 2e<sup>-</sup><br>
 Electrode B: PbO2 + 4H3O<sup>+</sup> + SO4<sup>2-</sup> + 2e<sup>-</sup> --&gt; PbSO4 + 6H2O<br>
 In a motor car battery, the electrodes have a coat of lead (II) oxide (PbO) and lead powder (Pb).<br>
 In the electrolyte, electric current converts the PbO to Pb on the negative plate, and the PbO to lead (IV) oxide (lead peroxide) PbO2 on the positive plate.<br>
 Discharging --&gt;<br>
 PbO2 + 2H2SO4 + Pb &lt; = &gt; 2PbSO4 + 2H2O<br>
 &lt;-- Charging<br>
 If you pass electricity through the battery after it is fully charged, "gassing"
occurs, i.e. water is decomposed into hydrogen and oxygen 
 gas.<br>
 Never smoke or allow a naked flame near a charging battery.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="32.7.4H">32.7.4</a> Battery capacity,  Ampere-hour (Ah)<br>
 1. Capacity of a battery refers to the quantity of electricity
it can deliver.<br>
 The ampere-hour (Ah), is the quantity of electricity equivalent
 to a current of one ampere flowing for one hour.<br>
 The milliampere-hour is one-thousandth of an ampere-hour.<br>
 (1 Ah = 3 600 coulombs of charge, 1 amp = 1 coulomb per second.)<br>
 Capacity in ampere-hours = current in amperes × time in hours.<br>
 A battery with a capacity of 50 ampere-hours can deliver a current
 of 5 amperes for 10 hours, or 10 amperes for five hours, after 
 being fully charged at the beginning and completely discharging 
at the end.<br>
 However, the capacity of a battery is not the same for different
 rates of discharge if the battery has already discharged within the rated 
 time.<br>
 Amp-hour capacity for a battery, it is specified at either a given
 current, given time, or assumed to be rated for a time period, e.g. 8 hours or 10 hours.<br>
 Automobile batteries can be rated by measuring the ability to supply
 sufficient current to operate the starter, or operate the lighting 
 system.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Amp-hour capacity<br>
The approximate amp-hour capacities of some common batteries:<br>
1. Typical automotive battery: 70 amp-hours at 3.5 A (secondary cell)<br>
2. D-size carbon-zinc battery: 4.5 amp-hours at 100 mA (primary cell)<br>
3. 9 volt carbon-zinc battery: 400 milliamp-hours at 8 mA (primary cell)<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">10-hour rating<br>
 For automobile batteries, a common standard rating is the 10-hour rating.
 It is the steady discharge current, in amperes, to reduce the cell
 voltage to 1.8 in 10 hours at 15<sup>o</sup>C, with specific gravity
of the 
 electrolyte 1.120 when fully discharged.<br>
 The full theoretical capacity of a battery cannot be used, because 
 the discharge current that must diffuse into the plates fast enough to 
 replace the electrolyte used in the production of an electric current.<br>
 Lead sulfate clogs the pores of the plates and restricts the movement 
 of the electrolyte so that chemical action is reduced, the voltage 
 generated by the cell is lowered, and the useful current is reduced.<br>
 Also, the resistance of the materials on the plates increases as
 the cells are discharged and the resistance of the electrolyte increases
 as 
 the battery discharges and the acid content of the electrolyte
falls.<br>
 Both a 6 volt 50 ampere-hour battery and a 12 volt 50 ampere-hour 
 battery will deliver a current of 5 amperes for 10 hours, so the 
 stated capacity of 5 × 10 = 50 ampere-hours.<br>
 The advantage of the 12 volt automobile battery is that it has 
twice the watt-hour capacity of the 6 volt battery, i.e. it stores twice 
the 
 amount of electrical energy.<br>
 The 6 volt battery delivers its 5 amperes at 6 volts, but the 12 
volt battery delivers the same current for the same length of time at 12 
 volts.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Watt-hour capacity<br>
 Power from 6 volt battery, W = V × I = 6 × 5 = 30 watts.<br>
 Energy capacity of 6 volt battery = power × time = watts × hours
 = 30 × 10 = 300 watt hours.<br>
 Power from 12 volt battery, W = V × I = 12 × 5 = 60 watts.<br>
 Energy capacity of 12 volt battery = power × time = watts × hours 
 = 60 × 10 = 600 watt hours.<br>
 Thus, watt hours = ampere-hours × voltage.<br>
 These calculations show that the watt hour capacity is equal to 
the ampere-hour capacity multiplied by the battery voltage.<br>
 Watt hour capacity = ampere-hour capacity × battery voltage.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="32.7.5H">32.7.5</a> Battery storage capacity<br>
 The storage capacity is the amount of energy a battery can store.<br>
 The storage capacity of a battery is the current that can be delivered
 × time, so the storage capacity of a battery in watt-hours = 
 ampere-hour capacity × battery voltage.<br>
 The storage capacity of a battery will have a maximum value as
"maximum deliverable current" or a minimum as "shelf life" in a 
 supermarket.<br>
 Battery life / battery longevity may be expressed as Reserve Capacity, 
 (RC), and ampere-hours, Amp Hours (Ah or AH).<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Battery capacity<br>
 Amp hours is the most common unit for battery capacity.<br>
 Amp hours = current X time.<br>
 Batteries used in photovoltaic systems are rated in Ampere Hours, 
 (AH).<br>
 So a 100 AH battery can supply 1 amp for 100 hours, or 100 amps 
for one hour.<br>
 Small cells have storage capacity up to 200 milliamperes, nAH.<br>
 Large lead-acid batteries have storage capacity more than 100 AH.<br>
 If a battery is rated 10 AH at 12 volts DC, Power, P in watts = 
VI, volts × amps, multiply both sides by t, Watt-hours, Pt = VIt = 
 12 × 10 = 120 watt-hours.<br>
 The Ampere hour rating, Ah, is the current available when discharged
 evenly over a 20-hour period, the standard time length for rating 
 batteries.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Reserve capacity<br>
 Reserve capacity is the number of minutes that a battery can supply a 
 useful voltage (10.5 volts or more), under a 25 amp discharge 
 rate.<br>
 Reserve capacity is used for batteries that run heavy loads.<br>
 For example, a battery specification "RC@ 25A = 160 minutes" means
 that at 80<sup>o</sup>F (about 27<sup>o</sup>C), the battery can supply
 25 amps 
 of current at a usable voltage for 160 minutes.<br>
 Reserve capacity is often a truer test of battery life than amp 
hours, depending on how the battery is used.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Shelf life<br>
 The "shelf life" is the length of time a battery can remain in storage, (not connected to a load), without losing its energy capacity.<br>
 However, the metal plates eventually leak and react with each other, even though the battery is not in use.<br>
Some people store their flashlight / torch batteries in a refrigerator, because they think this will extend the shelf life of the batteries.<br>
 Maximum deliverable current is the largest current a battery can push through a load without drop in its output voltage.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="32.7.9H">32.7.9</a> Deep-cycle battery<br>
 A deep-cycle battery should discharge at least 50% of its capacity, 
 for the best life span versus cost.<br>
 It may be capable of withstanding repeated substantial discharges 
 of up to 80% capacity.<br>
 The depth of discharge of the battery is related to the battery 
life, i.e. the number of charge and discharge cycles it can perform.<br>
 Deep-cycle batteries are used in sweepers, scrubbers, jacks, lifts, 
 electric golf carts, boats, cathodic protection, uninterruptible power 
 supplies for computers, and off-grid solar and wind power systems.<br>
 All deep-cycle batteries are classified and rated in amp-hours.<br>
 Amp-hours is the term used to describe a standardized rate of discharge 
 measuring current relative to time.<br>
 It is calculated by multiplying amps and hours.<br>
 The generally accepted rating time period for most manufacturers
 is 20 hours.<br>
 Heavy duty deep-cycle batteries may rate up to 260 AH.<br>
 Deep-cycle batteries are generally rated in amp-hours at a C/20 
discharge rate, which means 1/20 of the battery capacity for 20 hours 
 until the battery reaches 1.75 volts per cell.<br>
 A battery rated at 100 amp-hours will maintain a 5 amp load continuously 
 for 20 hours.<br>
 Actual capacity will vary with temperature, the size of the load
 and the rate of discharge.<br>
 Deep-cycle batteries used in UPS and telecommunication applications 
 are rated in reserve capacity, which is the number of minutes the 
 battery will maintain a constant 25A load at 80<sup>o</sup>F until
 voltage drops to 1.75 volts per cell.<br>
 To provide an approximate conversion to amp-hours, multiply reserve 
 capacity by 0.6.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="32.7.16H">32.7.16</a> VRLA sealed battery<br>
 A sealed VRLA battery (Valve Regulated Lead Acid), is maintenance
 free, produces negligible gas when charging, easier to transport, 
 because, unlike wet "flooded"' batteries, they are not classified 
 as "hazardous cargo".<br>
 The three sub-types are, wet, AGM, Gel.<br>
 The sealed wet type is primarily designed for the leisure and marine
 markets, some of which claim to be able to complete around 400 
 to 500 discharge cycles (to 80% depth of discharge).<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="32.7.14H">32.7.14</a> Starter battery, car battery<br>
 A starting battery (starter battery), used in most motor cars
provides short, high current bursts for cranking the engine.<br>
 So it frequently discharges only a small percentage of its capacity.<br>
 Engine starting batteries are rated in cold cranking amps, CCA.<br>
 Engine starting batteries are designed to provide a heavy surge 
current of as much as 200 amps for a period of 5-10 seconds.<br>
 There is no direct correlation between CCA and amp-hours, because 
 starting batteries are not designed for slow periods of deep 
 discharge.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="32.7.11H">32.7.11</a> Starting the engine with jump leads<br>
 Procedure before jump starting the engine<br>
 1. Ensure that the ignition switch is in the OFF position.<br>
 2. Turn off the lights and power draining functions to help ease
 the strain off the donor battery.<br>
 3. Ensure that the donor battery is the same voltage as the flat
 battery.<br>
 4. Ensure that the two vehicles are not touching in anyway.<br>
 5. Make sure that the vehicles are in either Neutral (Manual) or Park (Auto).<br>
 6. Remove the vent caps from non maintenance free batteries.<br>
 Be careful! Battery acid is corrosive!<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Procedure for jump starting the engine<br>
 1. Connect the red coloured jumper lead to the (+) positive terminal
 of the booster battery and the other end of the red jumper lead to 
 the (+) positive terminal of the flat battery.<br>
 2.<br>Connect the black jumper lead to the (-) negative terminal of
 the booster battery and the other end of the black jumper lead to a 
 good earth point on the disabled vehicle.<br>
 The engine block is typically the best place for a good earth point.<br>
 3. Start the engine of the disabled vehicle.<br>
 4. With the engine speed at idle, disconnect the jumper leads in
 the reverse order of connection.<br>
 5. The car has now been started and after any caps and covers have been 
 replaced it is ready to drive.<br>
 The cause of the flat battery should be identified and rectified
 as soon as possible.<br>
 6. Late model cars are generally more dependent on complex electronics 
 to function and any voltage spike can damage the delicate 
 electronic circuitry.<br>
 To avoid this problem, use jumper leads fitted with a "spike guards", 
 (surge protectors).<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="32.7.2H">32.7.2</a> Lead accumulator cell<br>
 The lead cell accumulator has emf about 2 volts and very low internal 
 resistance.<br>
 It is a secondary cell.<br>
 The terminals are usually marked + (red) and - (black).<br>
 Since the internal resistance is very low, great care must be taken 
 to avoid "short circuiting " the cell, i.e. there must always be a 
 resistance of at least 1 ohm in the external circuit connecting 
the terminals.<br>
(1.) Use a 250 mL beaker or jar with a cover to prevent 
drying by evaporation when the cell is not in use.<br>
 You need 2 sheets of 40 × 10 cm thin lead foil and 2 lead strips 2 × 14 cm as terminals.<br>
 These lead pieces require thorough cleaning by means of wire wool.<br>
 Fold the long sheets of lead tightly to the shorter strips so that
 they make good electrical contact.<br>
 The projecting ends will serve as terminals.<br>
 A blotting paper B lead c terminals A sandwich is made of alternating 
 strips of lead foil and blotting paper.<br>
 When the sandwich is ready it is rolled up quite tightly, secured 
 round the outside with one or two elastic bands, and placed with 
 terminals at the top, in the cup or jar.<br>
 Mark one terminal positive, and the other negative.<br>
 The roll is covered with a solution of sodium sulfate made by dissolving 
 40 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate crystals in 200 mL water.<br>
 The cell is now ready to charge with electricity.<br>
 This can be done with a 6 volt battery charger, or with any low voltage direct current
 supply giving up to 10 amps.<br>
 Connect positive on the charger to positive on the cell.<br>
 After only a few minutes charging, the cell will light a 1.5 volt 
 bulb.<br>
 Provided that the cell is always connected to the charger in the
 same way, as described above, the more times it is charged and 
 discharged, the more efficient it becomes.<br>
 There will be enough current to make a small 1 volt electric motor
 spin round.<br>
 The cell will remain serviceable for several months if the cover
 is put on when not in use.<br>
(2.) Charge a simple lead-acid battery with two electrodes, 
lead plates, in a sulfuric acid solution for a short time and then discharge 
 through a doorbell.<br>
 Charge two lead plates in 30% sulfuric acid and discharge through 
 a flashlight bulb.<br>
(3.) Internal resistance of batteries, weak and good battery.<br>
 Measure similar no load voltage on identical looking batteries
and then apply a load to each and show the difference in voltage 
 between a good and weak battery.<br>

<a href="./images/3.2.87ch.gif">See diagram 3.2.87: </a> Lead cell accumulator.<br>
(1.) Lead-acid batteries are one of the more common secondary cell battery types.<br>
They are rugged and inexpensive per watt hour.<br>
Flooded or wet batteries are the most cost efficient and the most widely used batteries in photovoltaic applications.<br>
They require regular maintenance and need to be used in a vented location, and are extremely well suited for renewable energy applications.<br>
(2.) 12 volt battery<br>
The most common motor car battery, the 12 volt battery, contains six cells connected in series, each of which produces 2 volts.<br>
Charged positive plate: lead (IV) oxide, Discharged positive plate: lead (II) sulfate<br>
Charged negative plate: lead, discharged negative plate: lead (II) sulfate<br>
Electrolyte: sulfuric acid<br>
(3.) Construction of a lead-acid battery<br>
Use a 250 mL jar or beaker with a cover to prevent evaporation when not in use.<br>
Prepare two sheets of lead foil 40 cm X 10 cm and two lead strips 2 cm X 14 cm for terminals.<br>
Clean the lead thoroughly with steel wool and degrease them by soaking in 0.5 M sodium hydroxide solution for 15 minutes, then wash in deionized water.<br>
Fold the long sheets of lead tightly around the shorter strips to make good electrical contact.<br>
The projecting ends serve as terminals.<br>
Make a sandwich of alternating strips of lead foil and absorbent paper.<br>
Roll up the sandwich tightly and put two elastic bands around it, and put it in the jar with the terminals at the top.<br>
Mark one terminal positive and the other negative.<br>
Cover the roll of lead with a sodium sulfate solution made by dissolving 40 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate crystals in 200 mL of water.<br>
(4.) Charging a lead-acid battery<br>
Use a 6 V battery charger or with any low voltage direct current supply giving up to 10 amps.<br>
Connect the positive terminal on the charger to the positive terminal on the cell.<br>
After charging for some minutes the cell lights a 1.5 V light bulb.<br>
When charging at the negative terminal electrode, the concentration of sulfuric acid increases.<br>
Pb(s) + SO4<sup>2-</sup>(aq) --&gt; PbSO4(aq) + 2e<sup>-</sup><br>
The more times the accumulator is charged and discharged, the more efficient it becomes.<br>
(5.) Discharging a lead-acid battery<br>
When discharging at the negative terminal electrode, the electrons move through the circuit.<br>
When discharging at the positive terminal electrode, the concentration of sulfuric acid decreases.<br>
When charging at the positive terminal electrode, the electrons move through the circuit.<br>
 PbO2 (s) + 4H3O<sup>+</sup> (aq) + SO4<sup>2-</sup> (aq) + 2e<sup>-</sup> --&gt; PbSO4 (aq) + 6H2O (l)<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Sulfuric acid<br>
 When a lead cell accumulator is fully charged, the concentration
 of sulfuric acid is at maximum.<br>
 When the accumulator is fully discharged, "flat battery", 
 the concentration of sulfuric acid is at minimum.<br>
 Use a battery hydrometer to read the relative density 
(specific gravity) of sulfuric acid in the electrolyte and check 
how charged the 
 battery is.<br>
 The density varies from about 1.28 in a fully charged 
battery to 1.15 in a discharged battery.<br>
 The density of sulfuric acid purchased for use in accumulators
 is about 1.25 at 20<sup>o</sup>C.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="32.7.8H">32.7.8</a> Construct a lead cell accumulator<br>
 Fix two lead foil strips in a beaker and add 200 mL of 1 mol per litre sulfuric acid.<br>
 Connect the lead electrodes to a power pack set at 2 V and switch it on for two minutes.<br>
 The lead strip connected to the positive terminal becomes covered with brown lead dioxide.<br>
 Disconnect the power pack and connect the lead strips to a torch battery.<br>
 The battery glows, but the brown leads dioxide on the positive terminal does not disappear.<br>
 Repeat the experiment with increasing charging times.<br>
 The time the battery glows increases with charging time up to 30 seconds then hardly changes.<br>
 Repeat the experiment with different charging voltages.<br>
 Different charging voltage makes hardly any difference in the time the battery glows.<br>
 However, at high charging voltages hydrogen is produced at the negative electrode and oxygen at the positive electrode.<br>
 Charging<br>
 At the positive electrode: Pb (s) + 2H2O (l) --&gt; PbO2 (s) + 4H<sup>+</sup> (aq) + 4e<sup>-</sup><br>
 At the negative electrode: 2H<sup>+</sup> (aq) + 2e<sup>-</sup> --&gt; H2 (g)<br>
 Also, lead reacts with the sulfuric acid to produce lead sulfate<br>
 At the positive electrode: PbSO4 (s) + 2H2O (l) --&gt; PbO2 (s) + 4H<sup>+</sup> (aq) + SO4<sup>2-</sup> + 2e<sup>-</sup><br>
 At the negative electrode: PbSO4 (s) + 2e<sup>-</sup> --&gt; Pb (s) + SO4<sup>2-</sup> (aq)<br>
 So sulfuric acid is produced during charging and is consumed during discharging.<br>
 As sulfuric acid has about twice the density of water, the density of the electrolyte shows the state of charge of the battery.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="32.7.7H">32.7.7</a> Charging the battery<br>
When the battery is fully charged, the specific gravity (relative density) = 1.280, electrode A is lead and electrode, B is lead dioxide.<br>
When the battery is discharging, electrode A changes from lead to lead sulfate, electrode, B changes from lead dioxide to lead sulfate, and the concentration of sulfuric acid decreases.<br>
When the battery is being charged, these processes are reversed.<br>
The concentration of sulfuric acid suggests the state of charge of the battery so this concentration can be measured with a battery hydrometer.<br>
 Electrode A: Pb + SO4<sup>2-</sup> --&gt; PbSO4 + 2e<sup>-</sup><br>
 Electrode B: PbO2 + 4H3O<sup>+</sup> + SO4<sup>2-</sup> + 2e<sup>-</sup> --&gt; PbSO4 + 6H2O<br>
 In a motor car battery, the electrodes have a coat of lead (II) oxide (PbO) and lead powder (Pb).<br>
 In the electrolyte, electric current converts the PbO to Pb on the negative plate, and the PbO to lead (IV) oxide (lead peroxide) PbO2 on the positive plate.<br>
 Discharging --&gt:<br>
 PbO2 + 2H2SO4 + Pb &lt; = &gt; 2PbSO4 + 2H2O<br>
 &lt;-- Charging<br>
If you pass electricity through the battery after it is fully charged, "gassing" occurs, i.e. water is decomposed into hydrogen and oxygen gas.<br>
Never smoke or allow a naked flame near a charging battery, because it may produce the inflammable gas hydrogen.<br>
Also, the lead-acid battery is dangerous, because it can produce very high currents and contains sulfuric acid that may be spilt.<br>
 It is the only common wet battery.<br>

To discharge the cell connect a torch cell lamp, light globe.<br>
Note the time that the lamp remains lit.<br>
The cell is now discharged.<br>
Repeat the experiment by increasing the time of charge and noting the time until discharge.<br>
Draw a graph of the results with time charged (x axis) against time discharged (y axis).<br>
