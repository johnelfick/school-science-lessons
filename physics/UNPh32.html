 Electric current, heat and light from electricity, direct current and alternating current, effects of a current:<br.
 heat and light, magnetic, chemical, Q (coulombs) = I (amperes) × t (seconds), current, nature of electric current and DC / AC. EMF sources<br>
 Electric current is carried by discrete charge carriers; charge is conserved at all points in an electrical circuit.<br>
 Energy is conserved in the energy transfers and transformations that occur in an electrical circuit.<br>
 Current electricity, electric current, ampere or amp.<br>
 Current, I, of electricity exists when an electric charge is transported.<br>
 The directional movement of charges through a wire is called current, I, and it has the SI unit ampere or amp, symbol A.<br>
 The ampere is the current in two parallel conductors 1 m apart in a vacuum with a force between them of 2 × 10-7 newton per metre of conductor.<br>
 The direction of the current is the same as that of the movement of charges.<br>
 The size of the current, current intensity, equals the charge flowing through the cross-section of a conductor in unit time.<br>
 I = q / t, where I = current in amperes, q = the amount of charge that passes a point in the circuit, t = time interval.<br>
 Assume that the direction is in the direction of the flow of positive charge, so flow of electrons to the right means flow of current to the left.<br>
 When charge flows through a conductor, the rate of flow of charge through any section of the conductor is called the electric current.<br>
 1 amp = 1 coulomb per second.<br>
 In a copper plating tank, 1 amp carries 3.29 10-7 kg of copper across every second.<br>
<hr width="100%" size="2">Ampere<br>
 (André-Marie Ampère, 1775–1836, France)<br>
 The flow of electrons through a conductor is called electric current and is measured in amperes, with the symbol I amp.<br>
 One ampere represents the flow of 6.28 × 1018 electrons per second past a fixed point in a conductor.<br>
 The unit quantity of electricity when one ampere of current flows for one second is called the coulomb, symbol Q.<br>
 So, I (ampere) = Q (coulomb) / t (second), amps = coulombs per second.<br>
 A "current of 1 amp" means 1 coulomb of electricity, charge, moves past each point in the circuit per second.<br>
 1 amp is the current flowing in two parallel wires one metre apart to produce a force of 2 × 10-7 newton on each metre of wire.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="32.5.0H">32.5.0</a> Conventional current<br>
If "current" is the conventional positive current, in metal wires, the current is carried by electrons moving in the direction opposite to the current.<br>
In conventional current, the cathode of a battery is the terminal where current flows out and the anode is the terminal where current flows in.<br>
Conventional current passes from the positive terminal, through a circuit, to the negative terminal of the battery, from cathode to anode.<br>
In a discharging battery or a galvanic cell, the cathode is the positive terminal since that is where the conventional current flows out of the device.<br>
<a href="../images/32.4.6.1.gif">See diagram 32.4.6.1</a>: Cells in parallel.<br>
Connect two or three fresh dry cells or lead cell accumulators so that their positive terminals are joined and their negative terminals are joined.<br>
The cells are now connected in parallel.<br>
Set up a circuit on a circuit cardboard with the two, or three cells, in parallel.<br>
Disconnect one of the cells. The circuit is not broken and the brightness of the light does not change.<br>
The voltage drop in the circuit is the same if one, two or three cells are used.<br>
So the voltage is 1.5 volts.<br>
If cells are connected in parallel, the total voltage is no greater than a single cell, but the total current available is increased in proportion the number of cells.<br>
If four cells in the circuit, the total current is 0.125 × 4 = 0.5 amps.<br>

 <a href="../images/32.4.6.0.gif">See diagram 32.4.6.0</a>: Cells in series.<br>
< Cells connected in the same direction in series each add their own voltage, e.m.f., to the total voltage.<br>
 However, each cell has an internal resistance, R<sub>i</sub>.<br>
 If connect three cells of voltage V1, V2 and V3, and current through the cells is I amps, then total voltage =<br>
 (V1 +V2 + V3) - ( R<sub>i</sub>1 + R<sub>i</sub>2 + R<sub>i</sub>3).<br>
 Connect two dry cells or lead cell accumulators so that the negative terminal of one is in contact with the positive terminal of the other.<br>
 They are connected in series.<br>
 Put a light bulb in the circuit.<br>
 Close the circuit with one cell, two cells, three cells in series.<br>
 Record the changes in the brightness of the light bulb.<br>
 The brightness of the light depends on the number of cells connected in series.<br>
 When you connect cells in series, the total voltage is the sum of the individual voltages of the cells.<br>
 If you use 1.5 V cells, then two cells give 3 V, and three cells give 4.5 V, four cells give 6 V.<br>
 The current will change.<br>
	
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="32.1.3H">32.1.3</a> Cells in series and parallel, internal resistance<br>

 If the terminals of a voltmeter are places on each end of a carbon zinc AA torch battery, the open circuit reading is emf of 1.5 volts.<br>
 However, if the battery in place in a circuit containing a resistor, hen current is drawn from the battery, measure the voltage across the battery.<br>
 It is &lt; 1.5 volts, because of the internal resistance of the battery.<br>
 So each battery has its own internal resistance.<br>
 In a circuit, V = V<sub>0</sub> - R<sub>i</sub>, where V = voltage of battery in the circuit, V<sub>o</sub> = voltage of battery in an open circuit, I = current
 drawn from the battery and R = resistance of the circuit.<br>
 So in a circuit with resistance R, the more current drawn the greater the voltage drop.<br>
 Union Carbide Eveready 1.5 V (EP3) alkaline manganese cell has internal resistance, R<sub>i</sub> = 0.18 ohm at 21oC.<br>
 Lead-acid batteries have an internal resistance, R<sub>i</sub>, of about 0.02 ohms at 21oC.<br>
1. Cells connected in the same direction in series each add their own voltage, emf, to the total voltage.<br>
 However, each cell has an internal resistance, R<sub>i</sub>.<br>
So if connecting three cells of voltage V1, V2 and V3, if current through each of the cells is I amps, then total voltage =
 [V1 +V2 + V3 - ( R<sub>i</sub>r1 + R<sub>i</sub>r2 + R<sub>i</sub>r3)].<br>
 Note that the internal resistance of this combination of cells is the sum of the internal resistances of the three cells.<br>
 Connect two dry cells or lead cell accumulators so that the negative terminal of one is in contact with the positive terminal of the other.<br>
 Connect them in series.<br>
 Put a light bulb in the circuit.<br>
 Close the circuit with one cell, two cells, three cells in series.<br>
 Record the changes in the brightness of the light bulb.<br>
 The brightness of the light depends on the number of cells connected in series.<br>
 When you connect cells in series, the total voltage is the sum of the individual voltages of the cells.<br>
 If you use 1.5 V cells, then two cells give 3 V, and three cells give 4.5 V, four cells give 6 V.<br>
2. Total EMF of cells in series is the sum of each EMF = EMF<sub>1 </sub>+ EMF<sub>2 </sub>+ EMF<sub>3</sub>, e.g. 3 × 1.5 volt torch
 batteries in series produce 4.5 volts.<br>
 A group of similar cells is called a battery.<br>
Cells in series:<br>
If the EMF and internal resistance of each cell are e volts and r ohms respectively, and there are n cells in series, EMF of battery = ne volts and
 internal resistance of battery = nr ohms.<br>
Cells in parallel:<br>
If the EMF and internal resistance of each cell are e volts and r ohms respectively, and there are n cells in parallel, EMF of battery = e volts and
 internal resistance of battery = r / n ohms.<br>
3. Connect two dry cells or lead cell accumulators so that the negative terminal of one is in contact with the positive terminal of the other.<br>
 They are connected in series.<br>
 Put a bulb in the circuit.<br>
 Close the circuit with one cell, two cells, three cells, in series.<br>
 Record the changes in the brightness of the lamp.<br>
 The brightness of the light depends on the number of cells connected in series.<br>
 When you connect cells in series, the total voltage is the sum of the individual voltages of the cells.<br>
 If you use 1.5 V cells, two cells give 3 volts, and three cells give 4.5 volts, four cells give 6 volts.<br>
 The current will change.<br>
4. When three identical cells are connected in parallel the total voltage is as if for one cell.<br>
 However, the total resistance for one cell is 1/3 R<sub>i</sub>r.<br>
 For the three identical cells with internal resistance R<sub>i</sub>1, 
R<sub>i</sub>2 and R<sub>i</sub>3, R<sub>i</sub>1 = R<sub>i</sub>r2 = R<sub>i</sub>3.<br>
 Let total internal resistance = R<sub>i</sub>,<br>
 1/ R<sub>i</sub> = 1/ R<sub>i</sub>1 + 1/ R<sub>i</sub>2 + 1/ R<sub>i</sub>3,<br>
 1/ R<sub>i</sub> = 3/ R<sub>i</sub>1,<br>
 R<sub>i</sub>r = R<sub>i</sub>1/3.<br>
 So total voltage = V -3I(1/3 R<sub>i</sub>r).<br>
 So motor car batteries may be connected in parallel to provide the extra current needed to start the engine.<br>
 Connect two or three fresh dry cells or lead cell accumulators so that you join their positive terminals and they join their negative terminals.<br>
 They are connected in parallel.<br>
 Set up a circuit on a circuit cardboard with three cells in parallel.<br>
 Disconnect one or two of the cells.<br>
 The circuit is not broken and the brightness of the light does not change.<br>
 The voltage drop in the circuit is the same if you use one, two or three cells.<br>
 The total current is unchanged.<br>
 If four cells in the circuit, the total current is 0.125 × 4 = 0.5 A.<br>
5. Total EMF of identical cells in parallel is the same as for one cell,<br>
 e.g. 3 × 1.5 volt torch batteries in parallel produce 1.5 volts.<br>
 However, the effect of internal resistance is reduced, because total resistance = r / 3.<br>
 Total EMF = [EMF<sub>1</sub>- 3I( R<sub>i</sub> / 3)].<br>
6. Connect two or three fresh dry cells or lead cell accumulators so that their positive terminals are joined and their negative terminals are joined.<br>
 They are connected in parallel.<br>
 Set up a circuit on a circuit cardboard with three cells in parallel.<br>
 Disconnect one or two of the cells.<br>
 The circuit is not broken and the brightness of the light does not change.<br>
 The voltage drop in the circuit is the same if one, two or three cells are used.<br>
 The total current is unchanged.<br>
 If four cells in the circuit, the total current is 0.125 × 4 = 0.5 amps.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="32.1.6H">32.1.6</a> DC circuits, circuit diagrams, Kirchhoff's circuit laws<br>
Electrical circuits enable electrical energy to be transferred efficiently over large distances and transformed into a range of other useful forms of 
 energy including thermal and kinetic energy, and light.<br>
 An electric circuit is a complete conducting path around which the current can flow.<br>
 The EMF is the source of work per unit charge and is used up by the potential difference in the circuit to turn an electric powered device.<br>
 Circuit diagrams use a system of conventional signs.<br>
 Kirchhoff's circuit laws (Gustav Kirchhoff 1824 - 87, Germany)<br>
Kirchhoff's laws state that the total current entering a junction in a circuit must equal the total current leaving it, and the sum of the potential
 drops around a circuit must be equal to the total EMF.<br>
Law 1 (Junction law, Current law):<br>
 At any junction point in an electrical circuit, the sum of all currents entering the junction = 
 the sum of all currents leaving the junction.<br>
 I = I1 + I2 + I3, where I = total current and I1, I2, I3 = separate currents.<br>
Law 2 (Loop law, Voltage law):<br>
 For any closed loop in an electrical circuit, the sum of the voltages = zero.<br>
 V = V1 + V2 + V3, where V = total voltage and V1, V2, V3 = separate voltages.<br>
Experiment<br>
 1. To connect a circuit first arrange the apparatus in the pattern shown in the circuit diagram.<br>
 Bare the ends of the connecting wires.<br>
 Connect the components with suitable lengths of wire.<br>
 Check that all connections are tight.<br>
 With large currents use thick connecting wires.<br>
2. Volts / amps relationship for electrolytes, 
voltage / current relationship for gases<br>
 <a href="../images/32.2.54.gif">See diagram 32.2.54</a>: Resistors in series and parallel.<br>
 Measure the voltage at different places in the circuit and show that the sum is zero.<br>
 There are many possible combinations of components.<br>
3. Use three dry cells or 6 volt batteries or from a 12 volt battery.<br>
 By adjusting the rheostat a series of corresponding values of current and potential difference across the high resistance can be obtained.<br>
 Use both arithmetic and a graph to find the ratio potential difference / current.<br>
4. Measure current and voltage in a simple circuit.<br>
 Change the voltage or resistance.<br>
 Connect an ammeter, voltmeter, rheostat and battery pack to show Ohm's law.<br>
 Place 2 V, 4 V, and 6 V across a resistor and measure the current then graph the results.<br>
5. To observe resistance of a conductor using an ammeter and voltmeter, apply a potential difference to an electrical conductor and some current flows through it.<br>
Ohm's Law states that, provided the conductor does not get hot, the current is proportional to the applied potential difference, so the ratio
 (PD applied to the conductor) / (current through the conductor), is a constant called the resistance, R of the conductor.<br>
 Connect the circuit as shown in the above diagram.<br>
 Close switch S.<br>
 Adjust the rheostat Rh so that a small current passes through the conductor of unknown resistance R ohm.<br>
 Record the current I amps and the potential difference V volts between the ends of R.<br>
 Adjust the rheostat Rh to get of five pairs of readings of current I amps and potential difference V volts.<br>
 Calculate R = V / I for each pair of readings.<br>

(André-Marie Ampère, 1775-1836, France)<br>
I (ampere) = Q (coulomb) / t (second)
An ampere is the current which, if maintained in two parallel straight conductors of infinite length, of negligible circular cross-section,
 and placed 1 metre apart in a vacuum, would produce between these conductors a force equal to 2 × 10-7 newton per metre of length.<br>
Proposed alternative definition: The ampere is such that the elementary charge is exactly 1.60 217 653 × 10-19 coulombs.<br>
(1 coulomb = 1 ampere / second).<br>
Abbreviations:<br>
Ampere, A,<br>

 If resistors with resistance R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub> and R<sub>3</sub> 
 are connected in series, they have the same current, I, passing through
 them.<br>
Total resistance of the circuit = R<sub>1</sub> +R<sub>2</sub> + R<sub>3</sub> ohms.<br>
 If resistors with resistance R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub> and R<sub>3</sub> 
 are connected in parallel, they have a common potential difference across them, V.<br>
Total current through them is the sum of the separate currents = I<sub>1</sub> + I<sub>2</sub> + I<sub>3</sub>.<br>
 If total resistance is RT, then 1 / RT = I / R<sub>1</sub> + I / R<sub>2</sub> + I / R<sub>3</sub>.<br>
 So the total resistance will be less than the smallest resistance in parallel.<br>
Experiment<br>
1. Connect one, two and three identical light bulbs in series.<br>
 Record the brightness for each combination of the light bulbs.<br>
2. Connect one, two and three light bulbs in parallel.<br>
 Record the brightness for each combination of the light bulbs.<br>
 If you connect six light bulbs in series in a circuit containing a 6 V battery, each light bulb receives 1 V.<br>
 If you connect six light bulbs in parallel in a circuit containing a 6 V battery, each light bulb receives 6 V.<br>
 When light bulbs are connected in series, the total voltage is divided between them.<br>
 For example, if three bulbs are connected in series to a 3 volt battery, each bulb receives 1 volt.<br>
 When light bulbs are connected in parallel, each light bulb receives the full voltage of the supply.<br>
 For example, if three bulbs are connected in parallel to a 3 volt battery, each light bulb receives 3 volts.<br>

 He experimented with other metals and dipped pieces of copper and zinc into a container of salt solution.<br>
 To get more electricity he made a pile of these containers and so invented the voltaic pile, a battery.<br>
 Although Luigi Galvani was wrong about the frogs' legs, we still use the terms galvanized, galvanometer and even galvanic.<br>
 However, Alessandro Volta is better remembered as the inventor of the volt.<br>

 A current balance measure the force of repulsion between two straight, parallel wires.<br>
 One wire is fixed and the other wire can move to allow measurement of the gravitational force that balances the magnetic force.<br>
 This force is proportional to the product of the currents in the two conductors, and depends on the permeability of free space.<br>
 It can be use to measure the forces between electric fields and a current-carrying wire.<br>

 Wait for the electrodes to reach the same temperature.<br>
 This ensures that the electrodes are in contact with the liquid and not the solidified melt.<br>
 Scrape and clean the electrodes between each test.<br>
1. Melt substances that are solids at room temperature, but heat very gently, otherwise they may ignite and burn, e.g. candle wax, cellulose

 Melted solids vary in their conductivity.<br>
 Only molten metals, alkalis and salts are good conductors.<br>
 Sugar and sulfur are non-conductors.<br>

 The solid sodium chloride does not conduct electricity.<br>
 Remove the electrodes from the salt and heat the crucible strongly until the salt melts.<br>
 Replace the electrodes and adjust the rheostat to current of 1 amp.<br>
 Remove the burner and let the salt cool.<br>

 The paraffin wax fails to pass a current when melted.<br>
 2. To make a liquid rheostat attach leads to the

 Put a switch, a torch globe and 1.5 volt battery in the circuit.<br>
 Close the switch and adjust the distance between the carbon electrodes or add more sodium chloride until the torch globe glows.<br>
 Changing the distance between the carbon electrodes changes the strength of the current in the circuit just like a rheostat.<br>

 The carbon rods in the stopper should be 5 mL apart.<br>
 Use crocodile clips to attach a conducting wire between one battery terminals and the bulb and the other battery terminal and one of the carbon rods.<br>

 Electrolytes are usually decomposed when electric current passes through them, electrolysis.<br>
 In electrolysis, the carbon rod (electrode) connected to the negative (-) terminal of the battery is the cathode, and the electrode connected to the positive (+) terminal is the anode.<br>

 1. Touch two wires from a 1.5 volt battery with the tip of your tongue.<br>
 Do not let the wires touch each other.<br>
 You can feel or "taste" something.<br>
 The electric current has set up a current in the nerve cells of your tongue and these are carried to the brain causing the sensation you feel.<br>
 This is an old method of testing whether there was still any "juice" in the battery.<br>
 Do not try it with a car battery or mains!<br>
2. Some people routinely test a 9 volt battery by licking the terminals and report that a near flat battery has almost no taste, but a full battery has a sour, acid taste.<br>
 Some people report a slight jolt and metallic taste.<br>
 This test is not recommended in this publication and note that the battery must be clean and without any signs of damage or degradation.<br>
 Sir William Thompson, Lord Kelvin (1824-1907), reported: "I measured the current that circulates when you touch a 9-V battery with your tongue.<br>
 It begins at about 3 mA and increases rapidly to 4.6-4.8 mA.<br>
 After a few seconds the sensation goes from displeasing to painful."<br>

<a href="../images/32.160.jpg">See diagram 32.160</a>: Household fuse.<br>

<a href="../images/32.163.3.gif">See diagram 32.163.3</a>: Miniature fuses used in electronics, audio.<br>
 A fuse is a safety device that protects electrical appliances by preventing too much electricity flowing into them.<br>
 The fuse is a thin wire of easily melted metal as part of an electric circuit inside a protective case.<br>
 If the flow of electricity becomes too powerful, the wire melts and stops the current flowing and so it interrupts the circuit.<br>
 The fuse wire is a length of wire with a given current rating at which the wire would melt if that current is exceeded.<br>
 A fuse is a wire that melts at a certain temperature and so breaks the circuit preventing damage to other components of the circuit caused by excessive current.<br>
 The choice of fuse is restricted by the electrical source and conducting wire used in the circuit.<br>
 In the installed circuit, the allowable current is fixed, so it is very dangerous to use a large capacity fuse that allows more than the allowable current to pass.<br>
 Any device that opens a circuit, because of abnormal electric current is called a circuit breaker.<br>
 A fuse wire will eventually fail when the load on the circuit is increased.<br>
 Use mains-operated circuit breakers (MOCBs) instead of fuses to eliminate the possible use of inappropriate fuse wire.<br>
 Be aware, MOCBs do not act in the same way as safety switches and should not be confused with them.<br>
Experiment<br>
1. Check the fuse box.<br>
 Know where the fuse box for your premises is and know how to turn off the power supply in case of an emergency.<br>
 Check that each switch, circuit breaker and fuse is correctly labelled and call a licensed electrical contractor if there is any confusion.<br>
 Use only the correct size fuse wire to rewire fuses.<br>
The fuse box is the equivalent of the circuit breaker's electrical service panel in that it is a metal box with a hinged cover that houses and controls the incoming electrical service and distribution to branch circuits within the house.<br>
 It provides overcurrent protection through the use of fuses.<br>
 The fuse box will have threaded sockets into which the fuses will be screwed.<br>
 These large threaded sockets look like light bulb sockets and are called Edison sockets, named after Thomas Edison who invented them.<br>
 There are several types of fuses that go into these sockets.<br>
 Some fuses have Edison bases and some fuses have a socket adapter that screws into the Edison base, but the fuse itself screws into the adapter base.<br>
 The latter are called "S" fuses and are also called "tamper-proof" fuses with rejection bases.<br>
2. Open the fuse box at your school or home.<br>
 Note the different kinds of fuses, how to trip a fuse and how to replace the fuse wire.<br>
 A fuse box should contain spare fuse wire.<br>
 When you use several appliances simultaneously, the wires carrying the current may become overheated and cause a fire.<br>
 Be careful! Putting a coin behind a fuse to allow more current to flow is a very dangerous practice.<br>
 Use the correct fuse wire.<br>
 A 30A fuse in a circuit designed for a 15A fuse is unsafe.<br>
Do not repair a fuse in a fuse box by wrapping a burnt out fuse with a metal foil gum wrapper, where the metal in the shiny part of the gum wrapper acts as a replacement conduit for the burned out fuse.<br>
 It may not burn out under excess current as a proper fuse does and result in a house fire.<br>
 Do not use any wire, pins, staples or hair pins to replace burnt out fuses.<br>
 Always replace burnt out fuses with the correct fuse wire.<br>
3. Examine normal and burnt out fuses.<br>
<a href="../images/32.163x.gif">See diagram 32.163</a>: How a fuse works.<br>
 Use fuses to protect electric circuits against overloading.<br>
 The fuse wire melts and breaks the circuit when an unsafe amount of current is flowing.<br>
 Use a thin strip, no more than 0.5 mm wide, of metal foil cut from a chocolate wrapper or a thread of steel wool.<br>
 Fasten it between the ends of two wires projecting through a cork.<br>
 Pass electric current through the fuse until the fuse wire melts and breaks.<br>
 A short circuit is the deviation of a current from the planned path along a path of less resistance.<br>
 However, this excess current can be stopped if a suitable fuse exists in the circuit.<br>
4. Insert a fuse.<br>
<a href="../images/32.164x.gif">See diagram 32.164</a>: Circuit with fuse and light bulbs.<br>
 Place a fuse in a circuit with three lamps in parallel.<br>
 Use a crocodile clip to short circuit the lamps.<br>
 If the fuse does not melt, cut a thinner strip of foil.<br>
 Experiment with different kinds and widths of foil until the foil carries the current when connected properly, but melts when a "short" occurs in the circuit.<br>
 Then replace the fuse and add more lamps in parallel until the fuse burns out.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="32.3.2H">32.3.2</a> Power surge circuit breaker, fuses<br>
Circuit breaker. A "spike" or power surge can move through any of the three electrical mains connections, i.e. active, neutral and earth, to damage electrical equipment.<br>
However, a circuit breaker can shut off power in the event of overloading across the three connections with built-in devices to absorb the spikes and protect the equipment, e.g. computer, domestic equipment.<br>
 A circuit breaker can be part of a multi-outlet power board.<br>
 Example specifications for a power board used in Australia are as follows:<br>
 Input: 240 volt, 50 hertz, Maximum 10 amps,<br>
 Surge capacity: To 4500 amps,<br>
 Maximum continual voltage: 275 volt,<br>
 Reaction time: &lt; 25 nanoseconds,<br>
 Clamping voltage: 750 volt, 50 amps.<br>
(The maximum voltage the surge protector will allow to pass through it before it suppresses the power surge and blocks any further current from flowing into a computer or domestic equipment.)<br>
 Energy absorption factor: 75 joules.<br>
4. Insert two identical bare copper rods, 1.5 mm diameter and 30 mm length into a cork of a thermos bottle and use the residual 15 mm to 20 mm long part of each of them out of the cork to make a stand for fuse installation.<br>
 Use the twist method to install the fuses on the tops of the rods, and then connect the conducting wires to the ends of the rods.<br>
 Use four dry cells, several 6 V and 3 A bulbs, connecting wire with 0.4 mm diameter, a 0.25 A, 0.5 A and 1.0 amp fuse.<br>
 The surface lacquer of the lead connecting with the binding posts must be cleaned off with a knife.<br>
 Switch off the electric switch K before operation and switch on after operation.<br>
 Connect the 0.25 A fuse and a bulb in the circuit.<br>
 After several minutes, use the back of hand to feel the temperature of the lead.<br>
 The limiting current of the 0.25 A fuse is 0.5 A, so the fuse can allow the working current of the bulb, 0.3 A.<br>
 Observe the condition that the fuse is burned out, when you two bulbs in parallel.<br>
 Substitute the 0.25 A fuse by a 0.5 A fuse whose limiting current is 1 A.<br>
 Connect three bulbs in parallel, close the circuit then check if the lead is very hot.<br>
 Then connect four or even more bulbs in parallel until the 0.5 A fuse is burned out.<br>
5. Use a 1 A fuse to keep all the four bulbs light.<br>
 Note the temperature of the lead and peculiar smell emitted.<br>
 Examine normal and burnt out fuses.<br>
 Use fuses to protect electric circuits against overloading.<br>
 The fuse wire melts and breaks the circuit when an unsafe amount of current is flowing.<br>
 Use a thin strip, no more than 0.5 mm wide, of metal foil cut from a chocolate wrapper or a thread of steel wool.<br>
 Fasten it between the ends of two wires projecting through a cork.<br>
 Pass electric current through the fuse until the fuse wire melts and breaks.<br>
6. Place a model fuse in a circuit in series with three cells and a lamp.<br>
 Use a crocodile clip to short circuit the lamp.<br>
 If the fuse does not melt, cut a thinner strip of foil.<br>
 Experiment with different kinds and widths of foil until the foil carries the current when connected properly, but melts when a "short" occurs in the circuit.<br>
 Then replace the fuse and add more lamps in parallel until the fuse burns out.<br>
 Open the fuse box at your school or home.<br>
 Note the different kinds of fuses, how to "trip" a fuse, and to replace the fuse wire.<br>
7. Short a low voltage high current transformer with zinc coated iron wire then vaporize wire with 500 amp surge.<br>
 Use fuse wire in a miniature house circuit, S.33 fuse wire and 8 Eh-5 fuses.<br>
 Connect fuse wires of different sizes across a heavy copper buss then determine which of the fuse wires of different diameters connected in parallel will burn out first.<br>
 Two resistance wires substituting for house wiring glow when they power a load of lamps and heaters.<br>
 Copper and nichrome wires in series show different amounts of heating due to current, and a paper rider on the nichrome wire burns.<br>
8. The fuses in the mains supply are usually 5 or 10 amperes.<br>
 Connect a 60 watt lamp to the 3-pin socket and turn on the mains power.<br>
 The 2 ampere fuse will sustain this load since the current is about 0.25 A.<br>
 Replace the lamp with a 1 000 W radiator.<br>
 The fuse melts, because of the current overload.<br>
 Short the 3-pin socket with a piece of thick bent wire.<br>
 When the current is turned on the fuse will melt immediately without harm to the mains fuse.<br>
 Use a piece of 5 amp fuse wire connected in series in a circuit with a car headlamp operated from a 6 volt storage battery.<br>
 The fuse should not "blow" (melt) with a 20 watt lamp, but should melt when you connect a 36 watt lamp.<br>
