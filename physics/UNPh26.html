<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="26.1.01H">26.1.01</a> Pitch, frequency, intensity, power of sound, concert pitch<br>
 1. Frequency<br>
 Frequency describes how fast something is vibrating.<br>
 one Hertz is one vibration per second.<br>
 The SI derived unit for frequency is the hertz, Hz, one cycle per second.<br>
 1 kilohertz, kHz = 1000 hertz, Hz.<br>
 Frequency is the primary stimulus for pitch although many people hear a small pitch change when the intensity of a constant frequency sound is changed.<br>
 Frequency of a vibrating string is inversely proportional to its length.<br>
 The frequency will be doubled for a string that is only half as long.<br>
 Frequency is increased by increase in tension.<br>
 Four times the tension in the string will double the frequency at which it vibrates.<br>
 Frequency varies inversely as the square root of the string's density.<br>
 When you increase the density of the string, you will slow down the vibration rate and decrease the frequency.<br>
 2. Pitch of a note<br>
 The pitch of a sound is how "high" or "low" it sounds.<br>
 As frequency of the vibration of particles increases, the pitch of a note is raised.<br>
 Pitch is affected by the mass, the length and the tension of the vibrating medium.<br>
 Pitch refers to when you hear different frequencies of vibration that are called differences in pitch,<br>
 i.e. higher frequencies as "high" notes and lower frequencies as "low" notes.<br>
 When you think of a sound (say, a musical note) as either "high" or "low", you are referring to its pitch.<br>
 The higher, the higher the pitch of the sound.<br>
 When you think of a musical note as either "high" or "low", you are referring to its pitch.<br>
 The higher the note, the higher the pitch of the sound.<br>
 The sounds you hear are the result of perceiving by your ear the oscillations of an elastic medium, usually air.<br>
 Sound can be described both in terms of its physical nature and your psychological reaction to it.<br>
 As a physical wave, a sinusoidal sound wave has a frequency.<br>
 Your psychological reaction most closely related to frequency is pitch, i.e. the highness or lowness, or "bass" or "treble" of your reaction.<br>
 The range of frequencies to which your ears are sensitive is about 20 Hz to 15 000 Hz.<br>
The human ear is most sensitive to frequencies in the 3.0 to 3.5 kHz range.<br>
The ear canal, treated as a closed column with length 2.5 cm, has a resonance frequency equal to 3.3 kHz.<br>
 3. Intensity<br>
 Intensity is a physical parameter associated with sound related to the sound energy crossing a region in space per unit area per unit time.<br>
 The intensity, I, of a wave is the energy per unit area, per unit time.<br>
 In practice, it is the average power carried by the wave through a unit area perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave.<br>
 If at time dt an amount of energy dE is carried through an area dA perpendicular to the propagation direction of the wave.<br>
 Then I = dE / dA × dt = Power per unit area, W /m<sup>2</sup>.<br>
 4. Power<br>
The power of sound is very low.<br>
 An orchestra of 75 persons playing at its loudest only produces about 70 watts of acoustic sound power.<br>
 The human car can detect tones with a power output of a millionth of a watt per square metre of area in those frequencies to which it is most sensitive.<br>
 Snow absorbs most of the sound energy that hits it.<br>
 However, it makes no difference how loud or long you shout at it, you will still not produce enough energy to melt the snow.<br>
 A crowd of 80 000 people at a football stadium makes a lot of noise, but they do not generate enough energy over a 90 minute match to cook an egg.<br>
 As sound waves move away from their source their intensity decreases rapidly according to the inverse square law.<br>
 Sound travels further over water.<br>
 This may happen if there is a warm layer of air over the water.<br>
 When the sound hits this layer it will travel faster and therefore further.<br>
 5. Concert pitch<br>
 Concert pitch is the degree of sharpness of flatness used by a group of musicians playing in concert.<br>
 The most common value of concert pitch is that the A above middle C should be tuned to 440 Hz, but higher concert pitches are becoming popular.<br>
 Before a concert starts, the separate members of the orchestra tune their instruments to a note given out by the principal oboe.<br>
 However, this could be done by using a well-tuned piano.<br>
The oboe is used, because its pitch is exact and its penetrating sound makes it easily audible over all the other instruments in the orchestra.<br>
 The interval between two musical notes that have fundamental frequencies in ratio 2: 1.<br>
 Pitch refers to the sound you hear being high, high frequency, or low, low frequency.<br>
 Pitch is not quite the same a frequency, because at very high or very low frequencies the loudness affects pitch of the sound you hear.<br>
<a name="26.1.02H">26.1.02</a> Sol-fa<br>
 An octave may be sung using the tonic (keynote) sol-fa (solfege) syllables: doh, ray, me, fah, sol, lah, te, doh.<br>
 Each tone is given a name according to its relationship with other tones in the key.<br>
This scale was invented by the Rev John Curwen, England, 1816-1869.<br>
Experiments<br>
 1. Attend a symphony concert.<br>
 Observe the oboist giving a tuning not to the whole orchestra.<br>
 2. Play a cassette and place your hand against the speakers.<br>
 Turn up the volume to feel the vibrations as you turn up the volume.<br>
 Feel the vibrations of high fidelity speakers for a high note and a low note.<br>
 3. Put a small V-shaped piece of paper on a stretched string or the string of a musical instrument.<br>
 Pluck the string and note the motion of the paper.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="26.1.1H">26.1.1</a> Hanging buckets, change in pitch<br>
<a href="../images/26.2.8.gif">See diagram 26.2.8</a>: Hanging buckets.<br>
 Use separate strings with different lengths to hang identical buckets full of sand.<br>
 Strike each string and note the pitch.<br>
 Note that strings under the same tension, the pitch are depends on the length.<br>
 The longer the string, the lower the pitch.<br>
 Players of stringed instruments apply this principle to change the length of the string to control the pitch of a musical instrument.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="26.1.2H">26.1.2</a> Pitch and length<br>
<a href="../images/26.2.1.gif">See diagram 26.2.1</a>: Pencils between string and meter stick.<br>
<a href="../images/26.2.1.2.gif">See diagram 26.2.1.2</a>: Finger on string.<br>
 1. Tie a loop of string to just fit tightly around the length of a metre stick.<br>
 Insert two pencils between the string and the metre stick at each end.<br>
 Insert two pencils at each end between the string and the metre stick.<br>
 Pluck the string in the centre and note the pitch and loudness.<br>
 Put the metre stick on the desk to amplify the sound.<br>
2. With one finger push the string down on the metre stick at the centre and use another finger to pluck gently the string on one side.<br>
 Note how the pitch and loudness changes.<br>
 Move your finger to different positions along the metre stick and pluck on either side.<br>
 Note how changing the length of the plucked string changes the pitch.<br>
 3. Tie a loop of string to just fit tightly around the length of a metre stick.<br>
 Insert two pencils between the string and the metre stick at each end.<br>
 Adjust the tightness of the string by pushing a ball point pen cap between one end of the string and the metre stick.<br>
 Place the metre stick flat on a table.<br>
 Pluck the middle of the string.<br>
 Note the pitch and loudness.<br>
 Move the ball point pen cap to different positions to lengthen or shorten the length of string that can be plucked.<br>
 Note the relationship between length of string plucked and pitch.<br>
 Compare the pitches of the two sides of the string and observe the relationship of the pitches to the lengths of two sides of the string.<br>
 4. A similar experiment uses an empty box or container with one small side cut out and a rubber band stretched around.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="26.1.3H">26.1.3</a> Pitch and tension<br>
<a href="../images/26.2.1.gif">See diagram 26.2.1</a>: Pencils between string and meter stick.<br>
 Use a ruler, fine string or fishing line, 2 ball point pens, tape.<br>
 Take the ball point pen inner out of one ball point pen.<br>
 Tape the ball point pens to each end of the ruler.<br>
 Tie the string lengthways around the ruler.<br>
 Twist the ball point pen inner around the string on the under side of the ruler.<br>
 Make sure you use the empty end of the ball point pen inner.<br>
 Tighten the string by turning the ball point pen inner through half a turn, and plucking the string each time.<br>
 Stand the ruler on the desk.<br>
 Note how increasing the tension on the string changes the pitch.<br>
 This can be shown on a guitar and other stringed instruments.<br>
 A similar experiment uses a bucket half full of sand suspended by string.<br>
 Keep adding sand and plucking the string.<br>
 Listen to the change in pitch.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="26.1.4H">26.1.4</a> Record player, change in pitch<br>
 Use a record player with variable speed, 33 revolutions per minute (33 rpm), 45 rpm, 78 rpm.<br>
 If the 45 rpm record is played at 78 rpm, the pitch is too high.<br>
 If played at 33 rpm the pitch is too low.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="26.1.5H">26.1.5</a> Stretched rubber band, change in pitch<br>
<a href="../images/26.194.gif">See diagram 26.194</a>: Stretched rubber band.<br>
Experiments<br>
 1. Make string sounds.<br>
Hold a thick rubber band slightly stretched between your thumb and second finger.<br>
Pluck it with the first finger of your other hand while holding it near your ear.<br>
Note the pitch of the sound.<br>
Keep plucking it while stretching it more.<br>
You expect the pitch to become higher as you stretch the rubber band, but it may seem to have the same pitch while you stretch it or even a lower pitch!<br>
When you tighten the string of a sonometer or a violin the string emits a higher note, because the tension in the string has increased.<br>
Also, the length and density of the string has hardly changed.<br>
When you tighten an elastic band over your finger and thumb the tension, length and density change enough for their effects to compensate each other.<br>
 2. Stretch three identical rubber bands over an empty match box.<br>
 Increase the tension of two of the rubber bands with matchsticks between the rubber bands and the side of the match box.<br>
Note that the pitch does increase with tension.<br>
The lengths of the rubber bands stretched over the ends of the empty match box have much the same density and length, but different tensions.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="26.1.6H">26.1.6</a> Thin and thick strings, change in pitch<a href="../images/26.2.9.gif"><br>
 See diagram 26.2.9</a>: Thin and thick strings.<br>
 Repeat experiment 26.2.1, but with two strings, one thick and one thin.<br>
 To make the tensions as equal as possible add a spacer on the underneath for the slacker string or hang a bucket of sand of the same mass from each string.<br>
 Note how increasing mass of the band change the pitch.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="26.1.7H">26.1.7</a> Whirling pipes, pitch and length<br>
 Use 1 to 2 metre length of articulated vacuum cleaner hose or swimming pool or bilge drain hose and string.<br>
 Attach a string to one end, hold the pipe in one hand and twirl it rapidly around.<br>
 Note how the pitch changes when you twirl it faster or slower.<br>
 Note how different length pipes affect the pitch.<br>
 Note how the air flows down the tube when you twirl it.<br>
 Australian aboriginal people have such an instrument that Europeans call a "bull roarer".<br>
 
 <hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="26.2.01H">26.2.01</a> Resonance in air columns<br>
Resonance</a> Kundt's tube, (Commercial).<br>
<a href="../images/26.1.1.gif">See diagram 26.1.1</a>: Sound wave travelling through air.<br>
<a href="../images/26.3.0.gif">See diagram 26.3.0</a>: Standing waves in a string.<br>
<a href="../images/26.3.01.gif">See diagram 26.3.01: </a> Standing waves in air columns.<br>
<a href="../images/26.3.02.gif">See diagram 26.3.02</a>: Reservoir-resonance tube apparatus.<br>
 A sound wave can travel down the tube, reflect at one end and come back.<br>
 It can then reflect at the other end and start over again.<br>
 The round trip constitutes one cycle of the vibration.<br>
 The longer the tube, the longer the time taken for the round trip, and so the lower the frequency.<br>
 The harmonic series<br>
 The frequencies of these sounds are whole number multiples of the frequency of the lowest (f1).<br>
 We call them the harmonic series.<br>
 Resonance is the rapid and uncontrolled increase in the size of a vibration when the vibrating object is subject to a force varying its natural frequency.<br>
 An object that can vibrate has a natural frequency at which it will do so.<br>
 An object may be forced to vibrate at a variety of frequencies.<br>
 As recorded in the Bible, Joshua built the Walls of Jericho for protection from his enemies.<br>
 They were solidly built, but they did not do him any good when they came tumbling down at the blast from a troop of trumpeters.<br>
 What do trumpets and the Walls of Jericho, opera singers and glasses, and soldiers marching on bridges have in common?<br>
 All bodies vibrate at their normal frequency.<br>
 Resonance occurs when the frequency of a sound source coincides with the natural frequency of the body.<br>
 A string will resonate only if a whole number of segments, each a wavelength long, exactly fit on the string.<br>
 Length of resonating string = n ( wavelength) where n is any integer.<br>
The fixed ends of the string must be nodes.<br>
The wavelength = vT = v / f.<br>
During resonance, the shorter the segments the higher the resonance frequency.<br>
Longitudinal waves, compression waves occur as length wise vibrations of air columns, liquid volumes and solid bars.<br>
At resonance, nodes exist at fixed points, such as the closed end of an air column in a tube, or the location of a clamp.<br>
A diagram such as 26.3.0 can be used to show the resonance of longitudinal waves as well as transverse waves.<br>
The diagrams specifically for longitudinal waves are used just to indicate the locations of nodes and antinodes.<br>
The distance between node and adjacent antinode is 1/ 4 wavelength.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="26.2.1H">26.2.1</a> Blow over open and closed drinking straw<br>
<a href="../images/26.3.2.14.gif">See diagram 26.3.2.14</a>: Blow over drinking straw.<br>
Experiment<br>
 1. Hold a piece of drinking straw against your lower lip and blow across the open end with your lips close together.<br>
 Note the tone of the sound produced by the open drinking straw.<br>
 Close the end of the drinking straw with your finger and blow again.<br>
 The tone from the drinking straw when the end is closed is about an octave lower than when the end is open.<br>
 Repeat the experiment with a shorter drinking straw.<br>
 When vibrating air changes the tone by an octave the air is vibrating twice as fast as before.<br>
 So the air was vibrating twice as fast in the open straw as in the closed straw.<br>
 The shorter the column of air the higher the sound, because air vibrates faster in a short column than in a long column.<br>
 So the pipes of an organ, e.g. a church organ or town hall organ are different sizes and lengths.<br>
 The highest sounds come from very small pipes and the lowest sounds come from very large pipes.<br>

xylophone (Greek <i>xylos</i> wood)<br>
 Set up the bottles in a row.<br>
 Partially fill each with water.<br>
 Make sure there is a different amount of water in each.<br>
 Now tap each bottle in turn and listen to the different pitch of each bottle.<br>
 Arrange them in order from highest to lowest pitch.<br>
 Relate this to height of the water in the bottle.<br>
 Does the width of the bottle affect the pitch?<br>
 Now blow across the top of a bottle.<br>
 Is the note the same as when you tapped the bottle?<br>
 Vary the amount of water in the bottle.<br>
 Do the notes change the same way as when you tapped against the bottle?<br>
 Is it the column of air above the water or the column of water that determines the note?<br>
 Hint: think about the length of the vibrating column of air in a wind instrument.<br>
 Can you tune the bottles to play a scale of music?<br>
 Check your notes against a musical instrument.<br>

<a href="../images/26.3.2.15.gif">See diagram: 26.3.2.15</a>: Bunsen burner resonance.<br>
Experiments<br>
 1. Use two glass or hard plastic tubes 50 to 100 cm long with one tube diameter greater than a Bunsen burner tube, but less than the second tube.<br>
 Light the Bunsen burner.<br>
 Hold the smaller diameter tube vertically over the flame then move it up and down until you can hear a resonance sound.<br>
 Hold the greater diameter tube vertically around the first vertical tube.<br>
 You can move it up and down to change the pitch of the resonance.<br>
 The resonance is produced by the sudden expansion of air in the tube.<br>
 2. Place the Bunsen burner on the floor.<br>
 Light the Bunsen burner and adjust it to produce its greatest flame.<br>
 Use both hands to hold a 2m long cylindrical metal or cardboard tube vertically over the Bunsen burner, a few cm above the top of the flame.<br>
 Hear the acoustic resonance produced by a resonant standing wave in the tube.<br>
 Use tuning forks to estimate the pitch of the resonance.<br>
 Shorter tubes produce a higher pitch than longer tubes.<br>
 The diameter of the tubes do nor affect the pitch.<br>
 The frequency for an open tube = speed of sound / 2 × length of the tube.<br>
 Use a second tube with less diameter to fit inside the first tube, like a trombone, and vary the length of the tube over the Bunsen burner.<br>
 Use the "trombone" to show that the resonant frequency in an open pipe is lower for a greater length.<br>
 Column length in metres (m) and frequency (Hz): 0.2 m 440 Hz, 0.5 m 172 Hz, 1.0 m 86 Hz, 1.5 m 57 Hz, 2.0 m 43 Hz.<br>

Experiments<br>
 Cut off thin little triangles from each side so that the drinking straw has an arrow shape.<br>
 Put the straw far enough into your mouth so your lips do not touch the corners, but are around the round uncut part of the drinking straw.<br>
 Press gently with your lips on the straw.<br>
 Blow gently just past the cut.<br>

 While you are blowing try to touch the cut ends with your tongue and feel them vibrating.<br>
 Slide a wider drinking straw or plastic tube over the drinking straw you are blowing into.<br>
 The second tube can be used to lengthen or shorten the length of column of vibrating air, just like a trombone.<br>
 If you do not get a sound, try keeping the cut ends together with your tongue and blow again.<br>
 If you still do not get a sound the cut ends may be too stiff.<br>
 Remove the straw and press the cut ends together or manipulate them to make them less stiff.<br>

Reeds made of cane and can vibrate by themselves, but attached to a musical instrument they can be forced to vibrate at the natural frequency of the air in the tube.<br>
The reed closes at lower air pressure and opens at higher pressure, so the air stream from the lungs of a player can sustain the vibration of the air in the musical instrument.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="26.2.8H">26.2.8</a> Resonance in aluminium pipe<br>
 The vibration of a pipe, caused due to being knocked, may drive the wave motion of the air inside the pipe.<br>
 The wave motion transfers and reflects so that standing wave forms inside the pipe.<br>
 This is the principle of wind instruments, e.g. a flute.<br>
 Its pitch may change through adjusting the standing waves of the air column inside the pipe.<br>
Experiment<br>
 Use a 1 m long, 2.5 cm of diameter, aluminium pipe.<br>
 Hold the middle of the pipe horizontally with your thumb and index finger.<br>
 Knock the pipe on its middle as hards as possible with a golf club.<br>
 Listen to the sound of the pipe.<br>
 Measure the pipe, from its middle to the two sides, separate 13 cm, 25 cm, 35 cm and 39 cm.<br>
 Mark these positions on the pipe with a sharp pencil.<br>
 Note that the positions marked are approximate.<br>
 Real exact position must be dependent on the resonance of the pipe.<br>
 Press some point on the pipe and knock it with the golf club.<br>
 If the pipe may sound the pure resonance, the point is the exact position.<br>
 Hold the pipe at the points marked separately with your thumb and index finger vertically, then knock it with the golf club.<br>
 Listen to the sounds and record them.<br>
 Holding the pipe and knocking it causes its vibration so that a wave column, i.e. a standing wave, forms inside the pipe.<br>
 The standing waveform depends on the position at which the fingers hold the pipe and the position knocked.<br>
 The positions are different, the waveform is different and the frequency of the sound is different.<br>
When you knock the pipe at 25 cm from the middle of the pipe, the pitch is the lowest (viz. the frequency is the lowest.)<br>
When you knock the pipe at 13 cm and 39 cm from the middle of the pipe, the pitch is the highest (viz. the frequency is the highest.)<br>
 The two ends of the above pipe are open.<br>
 At the open ends the incident wave and the reflected wave are in phase with one another, so the vibrations of the air at the ends are strengthened.<br>
 Thus both of the two ends are the antinodes of the standing wave.<br>
 Hold the pipe at different position and knock it thus the amount of the standing waves are different so the pipe may sound different pitches.<br>
 The more the standing waves, the higher the pitch of the pipe.<br>
 Find the best positions to be knocked and the points at which the pitch of the pipe is the highest and lowest by the same way.<br>
 If you plug up one end of the pipe, at the end, the incident wave and reflected wave are out of phase [having opposite phase].<br>
 The point is the node of the standing wave.<br>

Wind instruments, e.g. pipe organs, flutes, oboes, clarinets, produce their musical sounds by resonating standing waves in air columns.<br>
The air columns are in tubes either open at both ends or closed at one end.<br>
In a trumpet the player's lips vibrate in a cup-shaped mouthpiece, but in a clarinet or oboe air is blown between pieces of reed to cause them to vibrate.<br>
Standing (stationary) waves can occur in air columns where a tube is closed at one end.<br>
For example. flute, pan pipes, or in air columns, where tube is open at both ends, e.g. open organ pipes, saxophone, trumpet.<br>
In a flute or recorder, the player covers or uncovers holes to change the length of the vibrating air column.<br>
The player of an oboe blows air between two reeds joined as a mouthpiece, so they vibrate against each other to produce a standing wave in the instrument.<br>
Nodes refer to longitudinal standing (stationary) waves in air columns that always have a node at a closed end and an antinode at an open end.<br>
Antinodes formed by standing waves in air columns at the open ends of any tube are in located a small distance beyond any open end, called the end correction.<br>
As the instrument is played, the air in the resonating column becomes warmer and moister.<br>
Consider the effect of extended playing of a reed instrument such as a saxophone or oboe will have on pitch.<br>
How might these changes affect the total sound that an orchestra produces?<br>
How would musicians avoid these problems?<br>
Experiment<br>

<a href="../images/26.3.2.3.gif">See diagram 26.3.2.3</a>: Staff notation of the major diatonic scale.<br>
 1. The first recorded monochord was invented by Pythagoras, (570-500 BC).<br>
 He observed that the different musical notes from blacksmiths striking anvils with hammers depended on the weights of the hammers.<br>
 He invented a monochord, consisting of a stretched string over a sounding board with one end attached to a scale pan.<br>
 The tension in the string depended on the weights in the scale pan.<br>
 From these observations he devised the scale of eight notes, the octave.<br>
 2. The monochord is a hollow wooden sounding box with a wire whose length of vibration is adjusted by movable bridge B.<br>
 Adjust the tension in the wire with weights D.<br>
 Pluck the wire between A and B at the centre so that the wire between the bridges starts to vibrate and emits a musical note of definite frequency.<br>
 Change this frequency by changing the load so as to change the tension in the wire or change this frequency by changing the distance between bridges A and B.<br>
 Use a tuning fork to "tune" the sonometer to a sound of known frequency.<br>
 Use the thickest guitar G-string (0.4064 mm) (0.016 inch).<br>
 Start with slotted brass masses, up to 500 g, then use 0.5 kg masses, so you can increase the mass in 0.5 kg increments up 3 kg to give a tension of 4.9 N to 49 N.<br>
 3. Mersenne's Law (Marin Mersenne, 1637, France):.<br> 
The fundamental frequency of a vibrating string is proportional to sqrt tension and inversely proportional to the length and sqrt mass per unit length.<br>
 Equations for the vibration of a stretched string.<br>
* For a string under constant tension, the fundamental varies inversely as the length of the string,<br>
* For a string of constant length, the frequency is proportional to the square root of the tension, (the stretching force),<br>
 For example, as you tighten a guitar string the pitch, (sound frequency), increases.<br>
* For a given length and constant tension the frequency varies inversely as the square root of the mass / unit length,<br>
For example, thick guitar strings wound with copper produce a lower frequency than the lightweight steel or nylon strings.<br>
Experiments<br>
4. Hear the same pitch<br>
 Sound the fork and wire alternately and adjust the wire until you hear the two notes emitted to be equal in pitch.<br>
5. Listen to beats<br>
 When two notes of nearly equal frequency are sounded simultaneously you hear a regular throbbing noise called beats.<br>
 The frequency of the beats is equal to the difference in frequencies of the two notes.<br>
 Sound the tuning fork and wire simultaneously, adjust the wire so the beats become slower then disappear, because the wire and fork have the same frequency.<br>
 The fundamental note of the vibrating air column depends upon its length so you can tune an air column to a tuning fork altering its length.<br>
 6. Oscillating frequency of a string is dependent on the tension acting on the string and the length of the string.<br>
 Prepare a strip of wooden board.<br>
 Nail two pieces of short boards on either end of the wooden board.<br>
 Place the board flat on a level tabletop, the two short boards below so that the middle of the wooden board is in the air.<br>
 Draw a straight line on the wooden board.<br>
 Screw three screws with the same sizes on the board.<br>
 Prepare a piece of long nylon string.<br>
 Tie the string to the two screws at the two ends of the wooden board.<br>
 Adjust the direction of the groove on the top of the middle screw so that the string goes through the groove.<br>
 Screw the screws at the two ends of the wooden board to tighten the string.<br>
 Be careful not to make the string too tight.<br>
 Strike the string to make it emit a sound with a pitch.<br>
 Screw one of the screws at the two ends to make the string tighter.<br>
 Strike the string.<br>
 Repeat the above steps several times and listen to the sounds and compare the change in pitch.<br>
 You may find that the tighter the string, the higher its pitch, when its length does not change.<br>
 Insert a small board under the string so that the length of the string is changed.<br>
 Also, place a knife or a pencil under the string.<br>
 They may separate the string to change its length.<br>
 Strike the string and compare the change in pitch of the string.<br>
 Repeat the above steps.<br>
 Summarize the relationship of the length of the string to the pitch.<br>
 You may find that the shorter the string, the higher its pitch, when its tension does not change.<br>
 Prepare an open mouth plastic box instead of the above wooden board.<br>
7. Prepare a glass stick of 80 mm length.<br>
 Insert it under the string.<br>
 Strike the string.<br>
 The sound changes strongly obviously.<br>
 Every stringed instrument, such as a guitar and violin, has a gut made up of a wooden box.<br>
 It may enhance the sound and make the string sound partial tone that is producing resonance.<br>

 Sound is a form of energy.<br>
 Sound energy moves by longitudinal waves.<br>
 The molecules in the air vibrate back and forth, crashing into the molecules next to them, causing them to vibrate.<br>
 All sounds come from vibrations.<br>
 Sound is produced by a vibrating source that then travels through substances.<br>
 Sound cannot travel through a vacuum.<br>
 Sound is the sensation perceived the ear by the vibration of the surrounding air or any other medium, e.g. ear pressed on wood.<br>
 Infrasound and ultrasound refers to pressure waves outside the range of audible frequencies, so not heard by the human ear.<br>
A sound synthesizer stores sound waves electronically as a binary code, which can later be converted to a variable electric current that controls a loudspeaker.<br>
1. Sound waves reflect - echoes.<br>
 2. Sound waves refract towards the normal when moving from a less dense medium to a more dense medium where their speed is slower.<br>
 Sound wave refraction is not obvious as with light.<br>
 It occurs during the "cool lake effect".<br>
 During the day you see, but cannot hear cars moving on the other side of the lake.<br>
 During the night a temperature inversion occurs.<br>
 The temperature is coolest over the lake, but warmer with increase in height.<br>
 Speed of sound also increases with height so part of the sound wave closest to the ground travels slower, and part of the wave above the lake is travelling faster.<br>
 So the sound wave changes direction and bends downwards and you can hear the cars moving on the other side of the lake.<br>
 Sound wave refraction has been likened to a toy car on a hard floor approaching carpet from left to right at an angle not equal to 90<sup>o</sup>.<br>
 The front right wheel reaches the carpet first and slows turning the toy car towards the normal.<br>
 Similarly, a tractor with separate front wheel brakes can turn to the right if the right wheel brake is applied.<br>
 3. Sound waves diffract with longer wave lengths diffraction more than shorter wavelengths.<br>
 3.1 Sound waves can diffract around small obstacles.<br>
 You cannot see a person in front of you, because something is in the way, but you can hear the person talking, because the sound waves diffract around it.<br>
 3.2 Sound waves can diffract through small holes.<br>
 You cannot see people inside a house, but you can hear them if a window is slightly open.<br>
 To soundproof a room you must seal it to prevent any sound passing though holes in the walls.<br>
 4. Sound waves form interference patterns, e.g. beats.<br>
 Thunder from nearby lightning strike has a sharp cracking sound, but has a rumble sounds at a distance as the longer wavelengths refract.<br>

The amplitude of vibration of the comb teeth has increased so the sound is louder.<br>
Repeat the experiment at different distances from the hearer.<br>
For the same sound source, the farther the sources the lower the sound heard, because the less the energy distributed to the ear the lower the intensity of the sound.<br>
2. Repeat the experiment with the comb held against a small wooden box.<br>
A wooden box is best for making a sound amplifier, because it has the best resonance effect.<br>

 Demonstration tuning forks are mounted on a sound box to allow for forced vibration of most large glass or wooden objects.<br>
These objects have so many resonance frequencies that any tuning fork will cause them to resonate.<br>
 Similarly, a guitar has a sound box, and why a piano string is attached to a sounding board.<br>
 A louder sound is always produced when an accompanying object of greater surface area is forced into vibration at the same natural frequency.<br>
 Forced vibration at natural frequency causes resonance, high amplitude oscillation.<br>

Put the handle in contact with a wooden surface and you hear a pure note of constant frequency.<br>
This frequency is usually stamped on the handle of the tuning fork.<br>
But if you strike the tuning fork on a hard surface, e.g. the bench, you hear an impure note.<br>
2. Examine a set of vibrating tuning forks.<br>
Note how do their lengths and thickness correlate with their pitch when struck.<br>
3. The best place to strike a tuning fork is about 1/3 of its length from the tip to get a clean fundamental note.<br>

 The length of the air column AC may be varied by moving the reservoir R up or down or by moving AB up or down.<br>
 Record the room temperature.<br>
2. Sound the tuning fork of highest frequency just above A to increase the length of the air column AC until the sound emitted is at maximum loudness.<br>
Now the fundamental frequency of the air column is equal to the frequency of the tuning fork.<br>
3. Record length L1 cm of the air column.<br>
 Increase AC until you hear a second point of resonance lower down the tube.<br>
4. Keep the tuning fork vibrating and record the new length L2 cm of the air column AC.<br>
Record the frequency n of the tuning fork used.<br>
 When resonance occurs at length AC = L1, then the column of air length (L1 + e) cm = λ / 4, λ = wavelength of the tuning fork.<br>
The column of air that vibrates is slightly longer than L1 and its extra length is called "e".<br>
 When resonance occurs at length AC = L1, then the column of air length (L1 + e) cm = λ / 4, where λ = wavelength of the tuning fork.<br>
 When resonance occurs at length AC = L2, then the column of air length (L2 + e) cm = 3 × λ / 4.<br>
 L1 + e = λ / 4<br>
 L2 + e = 3 × λ / 4<br>
 (L1 + e = λ / 4L) - (L2 + e = 3 × λ / 4) = λ / 2<br>

 Insert the two ball point pens between the string and the board.<br>
 Strike the tuning fork to start its oscillation and let it touch the board.<br>
 Does the string vibrate to sound?<br>
 Add the weight to adjust the tension of the string, or remove the ball point pens to change the length of the string,.<br>
Do this so that the the string vibrates at the frequency of the tuning fork and its amplitude and loudness reaches the maximum.<br>
The string resonates with the tuning fork and a standing wave forms on the string when the frequency of the string matches the frequency of the tuning fork.<br>
2. Change the position of the ball point pen to change the fundamental of the string slightly.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="26.5.20H">26.5.20</a> Vibrating drums and balloons, ping-pong ball and tuning fork<br>
 1. Tape the string to the ping-pong ball and hang it touching one side of the drum.<br>
 Gently hit the other side of the drum and measure how far the ping-pong ball bounces off the side of the drum.<br>
 Repeat the experiment by hitting the drum harder.<br>
 2. Tape the string to the ping-pong ball and suspend it in a clear space.<br>
 Tap the tuning fork to set it vibrating and place it next to the ping-pong ball and observe its movement.<br>
 3. Touch the end of the tuning fork on the surface of a bowl of water.<br>
 Observe the movements in the water.<br>
 4. Inflate a balloon.<br>
 Use the first finger and thumb of both hands to pull out the neck to make a slit and let the air out of the balloon.<br>
 Observe the vibrations in the neck of the balloon.<br>
 5. Place an empty coffee tin on the palm of your hand.<br>
 Shout into its open top and feel the vibrations on your hand.<br>
 6. Make some different sized drums by stretching waxed paper tightly across the mouths of jars or other containers.<br>
 Fix the paper in place with rubber bands or string.<br>
 Tap the paper lightly with a pencil to make a sound.<br>
 Observe vibrations in the waxed paper.<br>
 Place rice grains on the paper and tap it again.<br>
 Observe the movement of the rice grains.<br>
 Note whether the size of the drum affects the sound made and the behaviour of the grains.<br>
 When you tap the drum or the tuning fork it vibrates.<br>
 As the vibrating surface moves in one direction it pushes molecules of air away from itself.<br>
 As it moves back in the other direction, pushing the molecules on its other side in the opposite direction, it leaves a "gap" on the first side.<br>
 In a sphere around the vibrating object, the molecules of air am alternately compressed and decompressed.<br>
 This produces compression and rarefaction in the air.<br>
 These compressions and rarefactions are longitudinal compression waves and produce sound.<br>
 Loudness or volume is determined by distance of the sound source from the ear, duration of sound and intensity of energy transmitted per unit area per unit of time.<br>

<a href="../images/26.1.3.gif">See diagram 26.1.3</a>: Vibrating ruler.<br>
Experiments<br>
 1. Hold a ruler on the edge of a desk with 15 cm extending over the edge and pluck it.<br>
 2. Place a ruler, or a steel saw blade, flat on the edge of a table and the ruler extends about 15 cm out of the edge vertically to the edge.<br>
 Press the end of the ruler on the table with your hand, press another one with another hand then suddenly leave your hand off it.<br>
 Observe its oscillation and listen to its sound.<br>
 Repeat the experiment, but suddenly hold the oscillating end of the ruler with your hand when hear its sound.<br>
 The sound will disappear immediately.<br>
 3. Use rulers of different length, material and thickness.<br>
 Hold a ruler firmly to the edge of a desk with one end overhanging.<br>
 Flick the free end of the ruler and listen to the pitch.<br>
 Change the length of the overhang and again flick the ruler.<br>
 Hold two rulers of different thickness or materials so that they both overhang the same distance.<br>
 Compare their pitches.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="26.5.22H">26.5.22</a> Vibrating speaker<br>
 Turn on a music player loud.<br>
 Observe the speaker it vibrating especially if there is a lot of bass in the music.<br>
 Put your hand on the speaker to feel the vibrations.<br>
 Put a bowl of water on top of the speaker to see the water vibrate.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="26.5.23H">26.5.23</a> Vibrating tuning fork touching water<br>
 1. Use a 128 Hz tuning fork to touch water, one tyne then both tynes.<br>
 Observe the surprising splash and sloshing caused by vibration in the fundamental vibration mode.<br>
 2. Hang a tuning fork with a thread.<br>
 Strike it to start its oscillation.<br>
Then quickly let its lower end touch the surface of water in a basin.<br>
 Observe the phenomenon appearing on the water surface when the sound of the tuning fork starts.<br>
 Touch the tuning fork with your hand and observe the disappearance of the sound and the change on the water surface.<br>
 Dip your finger rhythmically into water and see the pattern of concentric vibrations.<br>
 3. Hold a tuning fork loosely by the handle and strike the prongs against the edge of the desk.<br>
 Note what you hear.<br>
 Again, strike the prongs and quickly touch water in a pan with the tips of the prongs.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="26.5.25H">26.5.25</a> Vibrations in wind harps, Aeolian harp<br>
Wind harp vibrations occur in wooden resonating box with strings stretched across two sound bridges and tuned to the same deep note or different notes.<br>
Sound is caused by vortexes as air passes around the strings, vibrates them to produce a chord rising and falling up and down the harmonic series as wind speed varies.<br>
 An aeolian tone is a musical note caused by an air vortex action on a stretched string in an air stream.<br>
The sound occurs around "singing" power lines, car aerials and boat rigging during a gale.<br>
 The mythical <i>Aeolus</i> was the Greek ruler of the winds who lived on his island of Aeolia.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="26.5.26H">26.5.26</a> Vibrations of soap film<br>
A soap film can be set into motion by a sound wave in a wide ranges of frequencies.<br>
The vibration amplitude is large for all forcing frequencies.<br>
This caused by mass distribution concentrated at the antinodes, as observed by interference fringes in monochromatic light.<br>
 Experiment<br>
 Make a soap film on a brass wire ring.<br>
 Hold it until the unwanted water drops away completely.<br>
 Look for the angle at which you can best observe the soap film.<br>
 Put the soap film at the place where it can be watched clearly and is closest to your mouth.<br>
 Constantly speak monosyllabic words loudly.<br>
 Observe the oscillation of the soap film.<br>
 You can see similar oscillations of window glass when a big truck passes.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="26.6.0H">26.6.0</a> Ultrasound<br>
The human ear can detect sound waves with frequencies of about 20 to 20, 000 hertz.<br>
 This range is known as "sound", with infrasound below the range and ultrasound above the range.<br>
Ultrasonics, supersonics, are vibrations with frequencies greater than 20 000 Hz.<br>
 Some animals can hear sounds in the ultrasound range, e.g. dogs, but the human ear cannot hear them.<br>
 Bats use sonar echoes to locate insects using sounds in the 20 to 50 kHz frequency range.<br>
 Some insects have developed bearings in this range so that they can take evasive action.<br>
 Bats that transmit at a higher frequency can catch smaller insects than bats that transmit at lower frequencies.<br>
 Dolphins use clicks of ultrasounds to locate shoals of fish.<br>
 Echoing ultrasounds are used in underwater sonar and to detect cancers and check on unborn human foetuses.<br>
 Different tissues reflect ultrasound differently so a computer can assemble a picture of the unborn baby.<br>
 High amplitude ultrasounds are used to clean metals, to fatigue test materials and to break up kidney stones.<br>
 This is similar to loud sounds causing avalanches on steep slopes.<br>
 Sonar echoes are used in ships to measure depth and detect under water objects.<br>
 ASDIC was an early form of sonar, an abbreviation for Anti-Submarine Detection Investigation Committee.<br>
 Short wave radio listeners use several scales to record the characteristics of the signal they hear from their loudspeakers and headphones.<br>
 For example: "SIO" Signal strength, Interference and Overall rating, "SINPO" with the addition of N and P for Noise and Fading.<br>
