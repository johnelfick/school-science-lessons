 See: <a href="Comlist.html#FrictionH">Friction</a> (Commercial)<br>
 The direction of friction is such as to oppose motion.<br>
 When a force is applied to a body and the body is about to move or is moving the friction is called limiting friction.<br>
 Limiting friction<br>
 Limiting friction F = muR, where mu is the coefficient of friction and R is the normal reaction at right angles to the surfaces.<br>
 The frictional force opposes the motion of one surface in contact with another.<br>
 Walking is difficult on a surface covered by ice, so the lack of friction can be an inconvenience.<br>
 Machines are lubricated to reduce friction to allow the machine to do its work.<br>
 1. Friction is a force emerging in the relative motion of two objects in contact.<br>
 When two surfaces are in contact and one surface moves relative to the other, they produce a frictional force that opposes the motion.<br>
 Two types of friction are possible, depending on the nature of the relative displacement of solid objects in contact:<br>
* Sliding friction occurs when an object is sliding over the surface of another object.<br>
* Rolling friction occurs when an object rolls over the surface of another object.<br>
 Sliding friction<br>
 The sliding friction force is directed along the contact surface of objects against the displacement.<br>
 For the same solid objects, sliding friction is nearly proportional to the force with which one object is pressed against the other, i.e. to the force of pressure of one object on the other.<br>
 This force is normal to the contact surface between the objects, f = N.<br>
 The proportionality factor is called the coefficient of sliding friction, = f / N.<br>
 Sliding friction, kinetic friction, is the force needed to be applied
 to an object to keep it sliding across a surface.<br>
Static friction<br>
Static friction is the force that prevents an object from sliding across a surface when a force is applied to it, so it is the friction between two objects in contact that are not moving.<br>
Static friction is usually greater than sliding friction, kinetic friction, and must be overcome before an object can be set in motion.<br>
2. Coefficients of friction<br>
Between solid surfaces, friction acts parallel to the surfaces and in the opposite direction to the motion, or the attempted motion.<br>
Sliding friction depends on the materials in contact and their degree of smoothness, is usually less than static friction, is independent of speed of motion and is not dependent on area of contact.<br>
Friction is directly proportional to the normal reaction of the surface.<br>
For sliding friction, examples of coefficients of friction are as follows:<br>
Tyre on dry road = 0.7, Tyre on wet road = 0.5, Steel on steel = 0.6, Wood on wood = 0.3.<br>
Newton's second law of motion state F = ma, where F is the resultant accelerating force, but the acceleration will be less than expected, due to friction.<br>
Friction appears not only when one surface slides over another surface, but also when you attempt to cause such a slip by applying a force to an object.<br>
If the size of the external the force is less than N, no slip occurs between the objects, because the force is balanced by static friction that automatically assumes a value equal to the size of the force.<br>
 When the force attains a value equal to N, the object starts to slide over the surface of the other object, and static friction becomes sliding friction.<br>
 Static friction may assume values between zero and N.<br>
 The coefficient of friction depends on the force n and the velocity of slippage.<br>
 You can assume that the coefficient is constant.<br>
3. Direction of friction<br>
 The direction of friction is that friction always opposes the motion.<br>
 This statement is often heard or read and, indeed, friction does oppose the motion in very many situations.<br>
 In the following situation, with a block sitting on top of another block and the system moving to the right under the action of an applied force.<br>
 If you think about the forces on the system, you indeed find that friction that friction between the lower block and the table is opposing the motion.<br>
 What about the upper block<br>
 What is causing it to move<br>
 In this case, the upper block is moving, because of friction between it and the lower block.<br>
 Friction is in the same direction as the motion! In fact, you often meet this question.<br>
 The simple act of walking is a demonstration of friction acting in the direction of motion.<br>
 Push back on the earth and the friction force between your feet and the earth moves you forward.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="17.1.1H">17.1.1</a> Angle of repose of an inclined plane<br>
<a href="Commercial2.html#MechanicsH">Mechanics</a>, Inclined plane, (Scientrific)<br>
<a href="./images/21.3.1.gif">See diagram 21.3.1</a>: Inclined plane<br>
 Lift one end of an inclined plane until a block begins to slide.<br>
 1. Put the following different objects at one end of a smooth tray<br>
 1.1 Cubes of different substances<br>
 1.2 Knife fork and spoon<br>
 1.3 Identical packets of salt with,<br>
 1.3.1 smallest area down,<br>
 1.3.2 medium-sized area down,<br>
 1.3.3 largest area down.<br>
 Slowly lift the tray by raising the end where the objects are placed.<br>
 Note the angle or height of that end of the tray when the objects start to slide.<br>
 Note the sequence of objects starting to slide.<br>
 2. Repeat the experiment with another tray with a different surface or attach a new surface to the first tray, e.g. a sheet of sand paper or emery paper.<br>
 The objects will start to slide at a greater height than before, but note whether the sequence of objects starting to slide is the same.<br>
 3. Place a block on an adjustable inclined plane and adjust the angle of repose of the inclined plane until the block slides with uniform velocity.<br>
 The tangent of the angle of repose gives the coefficient of friction between the surface of the block and the surface of the inclined plane.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="17.1.2H">17.1.2</a> Capstans<br>
 See: <a href="Comlist.html#FrictionH">Friction</a> (Commercial)<br>

<a href="./images/17.185.gif">See diagram 17.185</a> Force to pull body up an incline<br>
 1. Pull a block along different surfaces with a spring scale, e.g. Teflon, wood sandpaper, and rubber.<br>
 2. Make a sliding friction machine by attaching a spring scale is attached to an object on a rotating table.<br>
 3. Observe the weight dependence of friction by pulling a friction block with a spring scale add a second equal block to the first and repeat the observation.<br>
 4. Observe the area dependence of friction by using a friction block with rectangular shape with one side twice as big as the other.<br>
 The friction block is pulled along the bench top while resting on either the narrow or wide face.<br>
 5. Observe friction blocks down an incline.<br>
 A loaded cart rolls down an incline and hits a barrier.<br>
 The load continues sliding on a second incline until it stops.<br>
 The mass on the slider is varied to show stopping distance is independent of mass.<br>
 6. Observe cross friction.<br>
 Push a block across the slope of an incline and the block will move with a straight line trajectory.<br>
 Knock a coin across and it will move in a curved path<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="17.1.4H">17.1.4</a> Interleaved telephone books<br>
1. Put two identical telephone books on the table side by side, push them to touch then interleave the pages, i.e. any page of one book has a page of the other book above it and below it.<br>
 After interleaving, push the books together to maximize contact between the pages.<br>
 Place a heavy weight on the interleaved telephone books then later remove the weight and try to pull the books apart.<br>
A considerable force is needed to pull the books apart and even heavy machinery may be needed.<br>
2. The considerable friction between the pages of the telephone book is augmented by "Chinese finger lock".<br>
It is used by police to restrain suspects before "patting down" to detect weapons or other objects.<br>
Finger lock techniques are also used in ju-jitsu, (jiu-jitsu), Japanese unarmed combat contests.<br> 
3. Pycrete<br>
 A mixture of 14% wood pulp and water can be frozen to produce "pycrete" that is much stronger than the same volume and shape of a piece of ice.<br>
 The pycrete should contain no air bubbles.<br>
 The friction between the particles of wood pulp causes the extra strength of pycrete.<br> 
4. If the edge of a piece of paper cuts your finger the cut is very painful, because of the multitude of jagged edges from the wood fibres in the paper.<br>

Experiments<br>
 1. Wrap a house brick in newspaper.<br>
 Attach the brick to a spring scale with string.<br>
 Put the brick on a uniform table surface with the largest area down on the table.<br>
 Practice pulling the spring scale to move the brick with constant velocity while another person reads and records the spring scale measurement.<br>
 If you pull the house brick horizontally at constant velocity, the applied force equals the frictional force.<br>
 2. Friction and different surfaces<br>
 Record the frictional force with different kinds of wrapping on identical house bricks, e.g. newspaper, plastic from a plastic bag, sandpaper.<br>
 3. Friction and the area of a surface<br>
 Turn the wrapped house brick so that a smaller area is down on the table.<br> 
Adjust the attached string and measure the frictional force.<br>
4. Compare starting motion friction with maintaining motion friction<br>
 Measure the frictional force needed to start the brick moving.<br>
 Compare the force with 2. 5. Friction and speed of motion<br>
 Measure the frictional force necessary to move the brick at different constant velocities.<br>
5. Friction and force pressing the surfaces together<br>
 Measure sliding friction with stacks of two to five bricks.<br>
6. Attach a string from a heavy box to a spring balance.<br>
 Move the box across the table by pulling it with the spring balance.<br>
 Record the force needed to pull the box at constant slow speed.<br>
 The force of friction opposes the motion.<br>
 The friction between the bottom of the box and the table is called sliding friction.<br>
7. Put a sheet of glass on the table.<br>
 Record the force needed to pull the box at a slow constant speed.<br>
 If the surface of the glass is smoother than the surface of the table, the sliding friction is less.<br>
8. Use chalk or water or oil to lubricate the surface of the table.<br>
 Record the force needed to pull the box at a slow constant speed.<br>
9. Bind a thick book with string.<br>
Place the book on a smooth tabletop, and, on a rough wood, then attach the string to the hook of the spring balance and pull the spring balance to make the book move with uniform velocity.<br>
Compare the reading on the spring balance and note when friction is the smallest.<br>
10. Prevent squeaky chalk.<br>
 You don't have to break chalk to eliminate squeaking, because if you use friction you can hold the chalk at an angle that eliminates it.<br>
11. Observe a sliding chain.<br>
 Hang a chain over the edge of the table until the weight of the chain makes it slide.<br>
 This simulates the action of a siphon.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="17.1.9H">17.1.9</a> Stabbed rice, gripping rice, suspended rice<br>
 See: <a href="Comlist.html#FrictionH">Friction</a> (Commercial)<br>
 A pile driver used in civil engineering construction pushes a pile down.<br>
 It can do this, because the pile pushes earth particles to the side.<br>
 1. Almost fill a narrow neck plastic jar with rice.<br>
 Note the level of the rice in the jar.<br>
 Stab down into the rice with a sharpened pencil.<br>
 Keep stabbing down, sometimes deeply to the bottom of the plastic jar and sometimes shallowly.<br>
 When the rice starts to grip the rice, slowly, with great force. push the pencil down to touch the bottom of the plastic jar.<br>
 The conical end of the pencil pushes rice sideways when the pencil is pushed into the jar.<br>
 When the pencil is raised and removed from the jar, rice falls into the space left by the pencil, so the level of rice in the jar decreases slightly.<br>
 The action of the repeated stabbing with the pencil is to pack the rice more closely.<br>
 Eventually, the rice is so closely packed to increase friction between the rice grains that you cannot raise the pencil without the jar of rice also being raised.<br>
 If enough chains of rice grains wedge themselves against the blade and the top of the jar, when the knife is lifted the entire jar will cling to it. 
 2. Use a jar with a narrowing neck.<br>
 Fill the jar to the brim with rice.<br>
 Push a pencil into the rice.<br>
 The pencil should easily slides through the rice.<br>
 Grip the pencil firmly and start stabbing the rice repeatedly in the centre of the jar, stabbing occasionally to the bottom.<br>
 The rice begins to form a crater.<br>
 After about forty stabs, the pencil begins to grip the rice, so it is more difficult to push the pencil down.<br>
 The conical tip of the pencil pushes rice sideways when the pencil is forced into the jar.<br>
 The rice packs more closely in the jar causing the level to rise slightly.<br>
 When the rice is packed more tightly, the friction between each grain increases and the friction between the pencil, rice and jar becomes so strong to prevent the pencil slipping through the rice. 
3. Use a jar that is wider than its opening.<br>
 Almost fill the jar with uncooked white rice and stab down into it with a knife using short jabs.<br>
 Some rice has moved aside to let the knife blade descend.<br>
 Add more rice to the jar, pull the knife up and stab down again.<br>
 After repeating this action a few times.<br>
 Stab the rice down to the bottom.<br>
 When you pull up the knife slowly, the jar and packed rice rises as well, because of the pressure between the knife, rice grains and wall of the jar.<br>
The pressure from the sharp knife is enough to force the rice grains apart, but then they settle back into place and lock into each other and hold the knife in place.<br>
 Rice grains have wedged themselves against the blade and the top of the jar.<br>
 The experiment may work better if you stab at an angle, not vertically.<br>

 See: <a href="Comlist.html#FrictionH">Friction</a> (Commercial)<br>
The friction acting on an object in a fluid, and the friction between two solid surfaces, is always directed against the motion of the object and depends on velocity.<br>
 When an object moves in a fluid, a force appears that hampers the motion of the object.<br>
 The fluid particles exert this force on the moving object.<br>
The resistance of the fluid medium differs from the friction between two solid surfaces in that no static friction exists, because the weakest possible force can displace an object floating in a liquid.<br>

 See: <a href="Comlist.html#FrictionH">Friction</a> (Commercial)<br>
<a href="./images/17.3.01.gif">See diagram 17.3.01</a>: Dropped ball bearings<br>
 Stokes' law (George Stokes 1851) describes the frictional force on a spherical ball falling through liquid, force = 6 × π × radius × velocity × viscosity of liquid.<br>
 A falling ball accelerates until it reaches a constant terminal speed, settling velocity.<br>
 F = gravitational force on the spherical ball less the upthrust.<br>
 Stokes' law can be applied to liquid and gas mediums.<br>
The falling sphere viscometer uses Stokes' law to calculate viscosity of a fluid from the size and density of a sphere falling in it, the density of the liquid and the terminal velocity of the sphere.<br>
Experiments<br>
 1. Drop ball bearings or a sphere with known density and weight into treacle or glycerine to determine their viscosity.<br>
 2. To demonstrate Stokes law, that when a body moves through a fluid the viscous resistive force is proportional to the radius a and its velocity v.<br>
 Arrange a series of steel ball bearings with different sizes so that they can be released balls simultaneously to fall through a liquid.<br>
 The smaller balls take a longer time to fall than the larger balls.<br>
 As a consequence of Stoke's law, the terminal velocity is proportional to the square of the ball radius.<br>
 Hence a ball of diameter "x" will take 4 times as long to fall a given distance than a ball of diameter "2x".<br>
 If x = 5, and small ball takes 25 seconds, then large ball takes 100 seconds to reach terminal velocity.<br>

Fluid friction, ball bearing falling in a liquid<br>
1. Viscosity is the property of a fluid that resists the force tending to cause the fluid to flow.<br>
Viscosity is the property of a fluid that tends to prevent the movement of one portion of the fluid relative to an adjacent portion, or prevent the motion of any body through the liquid.<br>
Viscosity is the internal friction of a fluid, produced by the movement of its molecules against each other, the result of the diffusion of atoms or molecules inside an amorphous material.<br>
Viscosity causes the fluid to resist flowing.<br>
A viscous material, e.g. honey, resists shear flow and strain linearly with time when a stress is applied.<br>
2. Absolute viscosity, η is a measure of this resistance, equal to the tangential stress on a liquid undergoing streamline flow divided by its 
 velocity gradient.<br>
 It is measured in newton seconds per metre<sup>2</sup>.<br>
3. Dynamic viscosity, the coefficient of velocity of a fluid at a given temperature, has symbol η (eta) and (mu).<br>
 Dynamic viscosity measures the resistance to flow of a liquid under shear stress in pascal seconds.<br>
 The SI unit is the pascal.second, Pa.s, in newton.second / metre<sup>2</sup>. 
 1 Pa.s = 1.00 g.cm<sup>-1</sup>.s<sup>-1</sup>.<br>
 Dynamic viscosity of water at 20<sup>o</sup>C = 0.001001 Pa.s.<br>
 The CGS (cgs) unit of dynamic viscosity is the poise, P (for some technologies centipoise, cP).<br>
 Dynamic viscosity of water at 20<sup>o</sup>C = 1.002.0 cP.<br>
 Viscosity: Pa s: Pascal second, N s m<sup>-2</sup>, a measure of viscosity replacing the c.g.s. unit, poise = 0.1 Pa s.<br>
4. Kinetic viscosity (kinematic viscosity), ν (nu) is the ratio of the viscosity of a liquid to its density ρ (rho).<br>
 The SI unit, ν = / ρ, where is measured in m<sup>2</sup> / s, and is measured in kg / m<sup>3</sup>.<br>
 The CGS (cgs) unit is stokes, St, or centistokes, cSt.<br>
 Kinetic viscosity of water = 1 cSt.<br>
5. At 20<sup>o</sup>C the viscosity of water is 1.002 mPas and its kinematic viscosity (ratio of viscosity to density) is 1.0038
 mm<sup>2</sup> / s.<br>
 Lubricating oil may be classified using a Viscosity index (VI) for change of viscosity with temperature.<br>
 When a liquid flows slowly through a pipe, the rate of flow depends on the viscosity of the liquid.<br>
 However, when velocity exceeds a critical velocity, ν, the flow becomes turbulent and the rate of flow depends on the density of the liquid and not the viscosity.<br>
Critical velocity, ν = k η ρ r, where k = constant. (Let water = 1000), η (eta) = coefficient of velocity of a fluid at a given temperature, ρ (rho) = density of liquid, r = radius<br>

 Mix 3 parts of vegetable oil with 1 part of cornflour (maize flour, cornstarch) to produce a colloidal mixture.<br>
 Leave the mixture to chill in a refrigerator, then remove the mixture to warm until it starts to flow.<br>
 Rub wool or hair on a block of polystyrene or PVC or a rubber ball to give the object a negative charge.<br>
 Place the charged object near the flowing mixture.<br>
 The mixture stops flowing and pieces of mixture may break off.<br>
 The mixture is an electrorheological fluid (ER fluid), i.e. a mixture of small non-conducting particles in an electrically insulating fluid.<br>
 Under the electric field, electrorheological fluids form fibrous structures, which are parallel to the applied field so the fluid increases in viscosity.<br>
 The dielectric cornflour particles separated by the oil form positive to negative chains aligned with the applied electric field.<br>
 The ER fluid gets thicker, because the charged dielectric cornflour particles in the chains attract due to positive negative attraction.<br>
 Similarly, melted chocolate may stop flowing in an electric field.<br>
 ER fluids are used in brakes and shock absorbers.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="17.3.4H">17.3.4</a> Newtonian fluids<br>
 Deformation occurs when a force is applied to a volume of material.<br>
 If two plates, area A, are separated by a fluid distance apart, separation height H, are moved relative to each other at velocity V, by a force F, the shear stress, force divided by area parallel to the force, F / A, is proportional to the shear strain rate, V / H.<br>
 An example of shear strain rate is the rate of stirring.<br>
 The proportionality of shear stress to shear strain rate follows Newton's laws.<br>
 So you can refer to Newtonian fluids, which follow this law of proportionality.<br>
 In a Newtonian fluid. the velocity gradient is directly proportional to the shear stress, the analogue for gooey materials of Hooke's Law for springs.<br>

1. For dilatant (shear thickening) fluids, the faster the liquid moves, the more viscous it becomes, shear viscosity increases with applied shear stress, the viscosity increases with the rate of shear strain, e.g. mixture of cornstarch and water (oobleck).<br>
When walking on wet sand the sand immediately below the foot is dry due to rearrangement of the grains from a close packed to a less close packed structure.<br>
Dilatancy is the property of increasing in volume when pressure is applied.<br>
2. For thixotropic fluids, the faster the liquid moves, the less viscous it becomes, the material becomes more fluid with increasing time of applied force, e.g. quicksand.<br>
Struggle in "quicksand", it becomes "quicker" and you will sink into it, so do not struggle to get out of quicksand!<br>
The proportionality constant is called the dynamic viscosity η (eta).<br>
Viscosity is the tendency of a fluid to resist flow.<br>

Thixotropy is the property of a fluid mixture to become more fluid, when agitated, e.g. strike the end of a ketchup bottle, the ketchup become "runny" and flows more easily.<br>
Cornflour is powdery starch synthesized from maize and used as a cooking thickener, (in USA "cornstarch"), (in Australia "wheaten starch").<br>
A cornflour mixture is called a stir-thickened mixture, shear-thickened liquid, and non-Newtonian liquid, because it does not follow the laws of Newtonian physics.<br>

 Add a few drops of food colouring, e.g. cochineal.<br>
 Stop mixing when all the cornflour powder is wet.<br>
 Tap the surface of the mixture with your index finger.<br>
 The mixture is correct if it feels hard, although when mixing it felt wet.<br>

 1. Viscosity index<br>
 The viscosity change is called the viscosity index.<br>
 The higher the viscosity index the less change in viscosity as the temperature rises.<br>
 The SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) classification is an unbiased way of classifying the viscosity of "light", "medium" and "heavy" engine oils.<br>
 For example, SAE 10 W is a "thin" oil that you use to start engines in cold weather and SAE 30 is a "thick" oil that you use to start worn engines in hot weather.<br>
2. Centistokes<br>
 The common denominator for Kinematic Viscosity measurement is "Centistokes", measured at 40<sup>o</sup>C, and 100<sup>o</sup>C, and at sub zero temperature, e.g. SAE 15W40 engine oil measures 13 to 15 Centistokes 
 at 100<sup>o</sup>C, but above 16.3 Centistokes you rate the oil as SAE 50 Grade.<br>
 3. Engine oil additives<br>
Additives to engine oil include the following: oxidation and / or corrosion inhibitors to retard engine deposits, detergent dispersers to keep dirty oil soluble, rust preventives, anti-wear agents to retard wear of moving parts, foam inhibitors to reduce froth, pour point depressants to allow oil to flow at low temperatures, and viscosity index improvers to reduce difference of viscosity of hot and cold oil.<br>
4. Friction and wear<br>
See: <a href="Comlist.html#FrictionH">Friction</a> (Commercial)<br>
Engines rely on moving parts to function.<br>
The surfaces that move over each other wear with use.<br>
Friction is the resulting force encountered at the common boundary between two bodies when, under the action of an external force, one body moves, or tends to move, relative to the surface of the other.<br>
Wear is progressive damage, involving material loss, which occurs to the surface of a component, because of relative motion at the surface of that component.<br>
 Wear is a gradual process, so the associated costs and inconvenience are not as apparent as failure due to brittle fracture or fatigue.<br>
 Lubrication is the application of lubricants to reduce friction and wear.<br>
 Boundary lubrication mode is reached every time machinery comes to a standstill.<br>
 Most of the wear takes place at start-up.<br>
 Hydrodynamic lubrication is reached within moments of the machinery starting up.<br>
 The oil pump begins to push the oil in circulation.<br>
 The oil pressure lifts each movable component into operational relationship with the mating component.<br>
 Low viscosity oils (light oils), flow freely, and high viscosity oils, (heavy oils), flow slowly.<br>
5. Viscosity index<br>
Viscosity changes with temperature, the higher the temperature the lower the viscosity.<br>
The Viscosity Index is an empirical numbering system that describes the rate of change of viscosity of an oil within a given temperature range.<br>
A low Viscosity Index signifies a relatively large change, while a high viscosity index shows a relatively small change, i.e. the higher the Viscosity Index the less oil thins out with increasing temperature and vice versa.<br>
 Fluid lubricants include specially formulated Engine Oils, Transmission Oils (Manual and Automatic), Heavy Duty Gear Oils suitable for differentials, Hydraulic Fluids, Compressor Oils.<br>
6. Engine greases<br>
 Greases are semi-solid lubricants.<br>
 A variety of viscosity ranges are produced.<br>
The Load Bearing Capacity is linked to both the viscosity (or thickness) and adherence or retention characteristics.<br>
 The speed of rotation (RPM) of the journal in a bearing will dictate the viscosity needs of the grease.<br>
 The same factors apply in gearboxes or transmission.<br>
 The rule is as follows:<br>
The faster the movement of the components, the lighter the viscosity of the gear / transmission oil, and the slower the movement of the components, the heavier the lubricant needs to be.<br>
 If you use a heavy viscosity oil, e.g. SAE 25W60, in winter condition, the engine may not start without being preheated.<br>
 Engines usually need much lighter viscosity oil, e.g. SAE 5W30, to enable easy cold starting.<br>
If you use SAE 5W30 oil in tropical conditions where pavement temperatures may be above 55<sup>o</sup>C, premature, wear may occur, because it is too thin or "light" for such high temperature conditions.<br>
7. "Speciality oils"<br>
 The OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) are asked to produce engines with finer tolerances, because the lighter viscosity engine oils will result in less internal fluid friction and diminish the amount of fuel required.<br>
 A survey of over 100 major transport companies in USA established that 80% of power is used initially in overcoming friction.<br>
 "Speciality oils" can minimize friction by increasing the film strength of the lubricants.<br>
 An interstate heavy transport operator who has used ordinary brand lubricants until recently decided to try a "speciality" brand gear oil in the differential of his prime mover to reduce the operating temperature.<br>
 The result was lower operating temperature, because of the higher load carrying capability of the gear oil by comparison with the oil previously used.<br>
 In another example, a used car given an oil change oil at 10 000 km was given a "speciality" brand of engine of the same viscosity (SAE 15W40).<br>
 After the oil change, it was travelling 120 km further on every tankful of fuel, so saving over 15% of the fuel costs.<br>
 In both of these examples less fuel is being burnt, so less harmful exhaust gas emissions pollute the atmosphere.<br>
 Experiment<br>
 Compare the viscosity of two engine oils by shaking two identical bottles at the same temperature by the same amount.<br>
 Invert the bottles and compare the speed bubbles rise.<br>
 The higher the speed the lower the viscosity.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="17.4.3H">17.4.3</a> Double ball drop, tennis ball over basketball<br>
1. Drop a small ball from chin height and record the height it bounces.<br>
Hold a small ball, e.g. ping-pong ball, just above a large ball, e.g. a basket ball, with the small ball at chin height, h.<br>
Drop the balls simultaneously.<br>
The balls have velocity V near the ground.<br>
The large ball hits the ground first, bounces and hits the still falling small ball.<br>
The small ball bounces off the large ball with velocity 3V to about nine times the original height, h.<br>
 Kinetic energy is proportional to V<sup>2</sup>, 3<sup>2</sup> = 9.<br>
2. Separately drop two balls with different mass, m and M and note how high they bounce.<br>
Hold the light ball to sit directly over the centre of the heavy ball, i.e. m over M.<br>
Drop the combination, weighing (m + M), and note how high the balls bounce.<br>
The light ball, m, bounces much higher than the heavy ball, and higher than its former separate bounce.<br>
The bouncing is an example of conservation of momentum.<br>
The combination of two balls hits the ground with momentum (m + M) X V1.<br>
 The larger ball bounces up with momentum MV2 and velocity V2.<br>
 The smaller ball bounces up with momentum mV3, and velocity V3.<br>
 However, m is much smaller than (m +M) so V3 is much greater than V2.<br>
3. Hold a basketball and the tennis ball next to each other at about shoulder height.<br>
Drop both balls at the same time.<br>
Observe how high each ball bounces.<br>
Hold the tennis ball on top of the basketball at shoulder height.<br>
Drop both balls at the same time.<br>
Observe how high each ball bounces.<br>
If momentum in a system is conserved, as the mass decreases, the velocity increases.<br>
In this tennis ball and basketball system, when the two balls are dropped on top of each other, the mass of the system is the combined mass of the balls.<br>
When the balls hit the floor only the tennis ball bounces up, the mass of the system decreases to only the mass of the tennis ball, so the velocity of the tennis ball increases.<br>
Observe how high each ball bounces.<br>
When the basketball hits the ground, it quickly bounces back up and hits the small ball, which is still falling.<br>
When the balls collide, the basketball transfers a lot of its energy to the smaller ball, so the small ball bounces very high.<br>
When the two balls are held above the ground, they have potential energy, mgh, which changes into kinetic energy, mv2, when they begin to fall.<br>
When the balls collide on the rebound, kinetic energy is transferred from the basketball to the tennis ball, so it bounces high into the air.<br>
On the rebound most of the energy of the basketball is transferred to the tennis ball.<br>
Its mass remains the same, so to conserve energy it moves faster and bounces high into the air.<br>
The basketball has transferred some of its kinetic energy to the tennis ball so it does not bounce as high as when falling by itself. 
4. Repeat the activity with the balls reversed, so the basketball falls on top of the tennis ball.<br>
The tennis ball does not have much energy to transfer to the basketball, because its mass is much less.<br>
So the tennis ball is squashed under the weight of the heavier basketball.<br>

From Newton's second law, force, F time rate of change of momentum.<br>
 When the change of momentum is uniform, F time rate of change of momentum / t, so Ft change of momentum, Ft = constant × change in momentum.<br>
 If the constant = 1, Ft = change on momentum = mv - mu.<br>
 Ft is called the impulse of the force.<br>
The conservation of linear momentum states that if there is no external force acting on a body or system in a given direction, the total momentum of the body or system will be constant.<br>
 If there is a force acting on a body or system in a given direction, the change of momentum in that direction will be equal to the impulse of the force.<br>
 It follows that if two bodies moving in the same direction collide, the momentum gained by one body will equal the momentum lost by the other body.<br>

Then balls 6 and 7 are knocked away from the other end, and balls 3 to 5 remain nearly at rest.<br>
 The system shows conservation of momentum and energy.<br>
For small displacements, the motion of the balls is linear so they show conservation of momentum and with the conservation of energy law, following the collision if x balls give an impulse to the system, then, x balls leave the system following the collision.<br>
Just after impact, all balls are in contact with the next ball or balls and compression occurs at their interfaces to store potential energy and produce interface elastic forces.<br>
 The line of balls moves at nearly the same speed affected by slight differences 
due to elastic compression and relaxation.<br>
 When all the balls are in contact, the kinetic energy of the system is less than the kinetic energy of the initially moving ball, some kinetic energy is temporarily stored as potential energy of compression.<br>

 The Volvo car company had investigated for the effect of seat belt in Sweden.<br>
 They analyse 50 thousand car accidents, half of them involved the use of a seat belt.<br>
The data analysis shows that among 25 thousand of no seat belt 37 persons died, 263 persons had severe injuries, but among the people who used seat belts in same numbers with the above, only 6 died, 161 had severe injuries.<br>
 The results of the analysis shows that the seat belt can effectively decrease the degree of the hurt in car accidents.<br>
 For a fixed change in momentum, if the time during which the change takes place is increased the impulsive force will be decreased.<br>
 If the opposite happens and the time is decreased, the impulsive force will be increased.<br>
 Equipment A 1.5 m long, 30 cm wide wooden board used for ramp, a small piece of wood used for a barrier, a toy car, a piece of Plasticine, (modelling clay), a piece of chalk, a metre ruler, masking tape and sheets of graph paper.<br>
 Mark 20 cm intervals on the ramp, starting from the bottom 0, 20, 40.<br>
 Support one end of wooden board by some books about 40 cm in height, the end of 0 marked is downward to construct a ramp.<br>
 Put the small piece of wood on bottom of the ramp about 30~40 cm from 0, tape it firmly on the table or ground.<br>
 Form the Plasticine (modelling clay) into a cube with side 1 cm, put it on the cover of the engine (in front of driver).<br>
 Put the car on the place of 20 cm of the ramp, release it, it moves along the ramp.<br>
 As the car crashes into the wooden block, observe what happens to the Plasticine cube.<br>
 Mark with a piece of chalk where it hits on the table and measure the distance between the marked point and impact point, accurately to cm.<br>
 Record the data in a table.<br>
 Repeat the above experiment twice, each time operate as consistently as possible.<br>
 Then calculate the average of the distances that the Plasticine was compressed for the three times.<br>
 Put the car on a higher place in ramp, e.g. 60 cm, repeat the above experiment, three times in one height, calculate the average.<br>
 Do the experiment at 3 heights.<br>
 Graph by using the data from the experiment on graph paper, the horizontal axis is the height of the car's original place, the vertical 
 axis is the distance of Plasticine compressed.<br>
 Analyse according to the graph what is the relation between the distance of Plasticine compressed and the speed of the car when it crashes.<br>
 You can see through your analysis that as the mass of the Plasticine is fixed, the more the car's speed is, the more the impact violently and so the variation of the momentum of the Plasticine is greater, the 
distance it is compressed is greater.<br>
 As the car crashes with the barrier in certain speed, it is acted on by a large impact force to stop it in a very short time.<br>
 This rapid change in momentum means the Plasticine is acted on by a very strong push in a very short time intervals.<br>
 If the Plasticine was replaced by a car driver the driver would be seriously hurt.<br>
 The seat belt not only stops the crash with the barrier in front of him, but also as the body of the car crumples lengthens the time interval for the change in momentum and so decreases the impact force.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="17.7.8H"></a>17.7.8 Seat belts, Instructions for using seat belts<br>
 1. Seat belt and vehicle speed<br>
 The higher the speed and the greater the weight, the greater the energy to be released if there is an accident.<br>
 Passengers not wearing seat belts are not connected to the vehicle.<br>
 If a frontal collision occurs, they will continue to move forward at the same speed at which the vehicle was travelling before impact, until something stops them.<br>
 When passengers are not restrained by seat belts, the kinetic of the body will only be released at the point of impact against the interior of the vehicle, e.g. the steering wheel, dash panel, or windscreen, or against the road if ejected from the vehicle.<br>
 At speeds of 30 km / h to 50 km / h, the forces acting on the body during an accident can easily exceed one tonne, 1, 000 kg.<br>
 Some people believe that the occupants can brace their weight with their hands in a minor collision.<br>
 However, even at low speeds, the forces acting on the body in a collision are so great that bracing oneself with arms and hands is not possible.<br>
 Rear passengers not wearing seat belts endanger themselves, the driver, and other people in the vehicle.<br>
 Seat belts, if fastened properly, hold the vehicle occupants in the correct sitting positions during an accident or braking manoeuvre, prevent uncontrolled movements, 
 and reduce the danger of being thrown from the vehicle.<br>
 Seat belts reduce the kinetic energy as do front crumple zones and the airbag system.<br>
 Wearing a seat belt is required by law in most countries.<br>
 2. Airbags in vehicles<br>
The airbag system is not a substitute for the seat belts, because triggered airbags provide only additional protection and airbags are not triggered in all kinds of accidents.<br>
 The front airbags will not be triggered during minor frontal collisions, minor side collisions, rear collisions, rolls or accidents in which the airbag trigger threshold in the control unit is not exceeded.<br>
 3. Maintenance of seat belts<br>
 Regularly check the condition of all seat belts.<br>
 Keep the seat belts clean.<br>
 Never let any foreign bodies and liquids get on to the seat belt, the latch plate or into the slot for the seat belt buckle.<br>
 Do not allow the belt webbing to become jammed, damaged or to rub on any sharp edges.<br>
 Do not trap or damage the seat belt and latch plate, when closing the door.<br>
 Never remove, modify or repair the seat belt or any part of the belt fixture system.<br>
 Always fasten the seat belt correctly before any journey and wear it properly while the vehicle is in motion.<br>
 4. Fastening seat belts<br>
 Fasten seat belts before every trip and adjust the front seat and head restraint correctly with the rear seat backrests in an upright position.<br>
 Take hold of the latch plate and pull across your chest and pelvis, but do not twist the belt in the process.<br>
 Insert the latch plate securely into the buckle belonging to the occupied seat.<br>
 Pull on the seat belt to ensure that the latch plate is securely locked in the buckle.<br>
 The shoulder part of the seat belt must always lie on the centre of the shoulder and between the breasts, never across the neck, or over or under the arm of behind the back.<br>
 The lap part of the seat belt must always be across the pelvis, never across the stomach, especially with pregnant women.<br>
 The seat belt must always lie flat and snugly on the body.<br>
Tighten the belt when necessary.<br>
 5. Unfastening and removing seat belts<br>
 When unfastening seat belts, the belt has been completely removed when a "clicking" sound can be heard as the seat belt is being rolled up.<br>
 A locked seat belt must be released when a vehicle occupant uses the seat belt.<br>
 Unfasten seat belts only when the vehicle is stationary.<br>
 Press the red button in the buckle.<br>
 The latch plate is released and springs out.<br>
 Guide the belt back by hand so that it rolls up easily, without twisting the seat belt and without damaging the trim.<br>
 If removing the seat belt from the belt guide is difficult, the seat belt may have become twisted if it were returned too quickly into the side trim.<br>
 Take hold of the latch plate then slowly and carefully pull out the seat belt.<br>
 Untwist the seat belt and guide it back slowly by hand.<br>
 Fasten the seat belt even if you are unable to undo the twist.<br>
 However, the twist should not be in part of the seat belt that comes into direct contact with the body.<br>
 The twist should be corrected immediately by a qualified workshop.<br>

<a href="./images/34.7.1.gif">See diagram 34.7.1</a>: Water rocket<br>
 A water rocket uses water as its reaction mass.<br>
 The pressure vessel, the engine of the rocket, is usually a used plastic soft drink bottle.<br>
 The water is forced out by a pressurized gas, compressed air.<br>
 As the water is ejected, the mass of the rocket mass becomes less so less force is needed to maintain acceleration.<br>
 However, as the gas expands its pressure becomes less and can provide less force.<br>
 The Asia-Pacific Regional Space Agency Forum (APRSAF) hosts an annual Water Rocket event in a student between 12 and 16 years of age, and an accompanying teacher, is selected for a competition
 where the rocket must hit a 4m diameter target at a range of 60 m.<br>
 1. Pump a toy water rocket the same number of times first with only air and then with water.<br>
 2. Fill the rocket 1/3 with water.<br>
 Pump it a specific number of times (your specification) and launch the rocket (you will probably get wet).<br>
 Repeat the launch with the rocket filled with air to show the difference in range.<br>
