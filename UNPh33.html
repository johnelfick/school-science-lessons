 <a href="32.162.GIF">See diagram 32.162</a>: Heat and light from electricity.<br>
 A substance is incandescent if it emits light as a result of its temperature 
 being raised.<br> 
 Hot solids or liquids emit wavelengths of radiation depending on the 
temperature as a continuous spectrum.<br> 
 At lower temperatures they emit red wavelengths, so the metal appears
 to be "red hot".<br> 
 At higher temperatures, they emit the full visible spectrum as white 
light, so the metal appears to be "white hot" or "incandescent".<br> 
 The incandescent filament in an electric light globe, a filament lamp, 
 is "white hot".<br> 
Experiment<br>
1. Heat source<br>
* Remove the shade from a bed lamp containing a 100 W incandescent electric light bulb.<br> 
 Cover the bulb with very thin aluminium sheet, e.g. aluminium cooking paper.<br> 
* Insert a 100 watt pearl electric light bulb in a holder so that you can dangle the light bulb down.<br> 
2. Push the ends of two pieces of copper wire through a cork in a small bottle.<br> 
Connect the ends of the copper wire inside the bottle with a stand of steel wool.<br> 
Connect this model electric lamp model in a circuit with one or more dry cells, or lead cell accumulators, and a switch.<br> 
Close the switch until the fine wire filament begins to glow.<br> 
At first the heated iron wire produces light, but soon the iron combines with the oxygen of the air inside the bottle and burns.<br> 
3. Examine a manufactured electric light bulb.<br> 
It contains a mixture of argon and nitrogen, but no oxygen.<br> 
It has a tungsten carbide wire filament that glows without burning when heated to a high temperature.<br> 
The argon restrains the blackening of the inside of the bulb by deposition of tungsten vapour.<br> 
However, fluorescent lamps containing mercury vapour or neon gas are much more energy-efficient than incandescent lamps.<br>

See: <a href="Comlist.html#Batteries">Batteries</a> (Commercial).<br>
Electrochemical cells form electricity from chemical reactions.<br> 
The cell is made up of two half cells.<br> 
Each half cell consists of an electrode in contact with an electrolyte.<br> 
It is usually a metal in contact with a solution of its salts.<br> 
The half cells are separated by a porous membrane or salt bridge that allows movement of ions between the half cells.<br> 
In an electrochemical cell:<br>
* Cations (positive ions, e.g. Fe<sup>2+</sup>), flow to the cathode where they are reduced, i.e. gain electrons, from the cathode.<br>
* Anions (negative ions, e.g. SO4<sup>2-</sup>), flow to the anode where they are oxidized, i.e. lose electrons, by depositing electrons onto the anode.<br> 
The anode is usually labelled as the positive terminal with "+" sign on it and painted red.<br> 
The cathode is usually labelled as the negative terminal, with "-" sign on it and painted black.<br> 
When electrochemical cells are part of a circuit, electrons carry electric current through the external electrical circuit and ions carry current through
the solutions in the cell.<br> 
Oxidation at the anode and reduction at the cathode occur in both electrochemical and electrolytic cells.<br> 
However, an electrochemical cell can react spontaneously, but an electrolytic cell needs external electrical energy to force electrons around the circuit.<br> 
1. Electrochemical cells react spontaneously.<br>
The anode is the negative terminal through which electrons enter and conventional current leaves.<br>
The current formed by a chemical cell is from chemical reactions inside the cell.<br>
Voltaic cells (galvanic cells) and common "batteries" are electrochemical cells that generate electric current.<br>
In simple electrochemical cells, from copper and zinc metals in separate solutions of their sulfates, electrons move from zinc metal to copper metal through
an external wire, an electrically conducting path, i.e. as electric current.<br>
Electrochemical cells generate electric current by using two different metals that differ in their tendency to lose electrons.<br>
For example, zinc tends to lose electrons more than copper, so by placing zinc and copper metal in solutions of their salts, electrons flow through a wire from
the zinc to the copper.<br>
A cathode is a negative electrode or terminal.<br>
The cathode is usually labelled as the negative terminal, with "-" sign on it and painted black.<br>
An anode is a positive electrode or terminal.<br>
The anode is usually labelled as the positive terminal with "+" sign on it and painted red.<br>
 Zn (s) --> Zn<sup>2+</sup> (aq) + 2e<sup>-</sup><br>
At the negative terminal, the anode, oxidation, because electrons are lost.<br>
 Cu<sup>2+</sup> (aq) + 2e- --> Cu (s)<br>
At the positive terminal, the cathode, reduction, because electrons are gained.<br>
2. Electrochemical cells form electricity from chemical reactions.<br>
The cell is made up of two half cells.<br>
Each half cell consists of an electrode in contact with an electrolyte.<br>
It is usually a metal in contact with a solution of one of its salts.<br>
The half cells are separated by a porous membrane or salt bridge that allows movement of ions between the half cells.<br>
3. Inside an electrochemical cell:<br>
Cations (positive ions, e.g. Fe<sup>2+</sup>), flow to the cathode where they are reduced, i.e. gain electrons, from the cathode.<br>
Anions (negative ions, e.g. SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>), flow to the anode where they are oxidized, i.e. lose electrons, by depositing electrons onto
 the anode.<br>
4. When electrochemical cells are part of a circuit, electrons carry electric current through the external electrical circuit and ions carry current through the
 solutions in the cell.<br>

<a href="3.2.85.2ch.GIF">See diagram 3.2.85.2</a>: Voltaic Cell: Zinc/Copper.<br>
1. Put a piece of zinc metal in a zinc sulfate solution to form a Zn / Zn<sup>2+</sup>half cell.<br>
The zinc metal atoms dissolve as zinc ions, leaving negative charges on the electrode until the increased charge stops the process.<br>

Record any changes in the voltmeter reading.<br>
Note the maximum reading.<br>
Note any changes at the copper foil and the zinc foil.<br>
The voltage falls to zero after a short time, because copper deposits on the zinc and causes the reaction to stop.<br>
Zinc metal becomes zinc ions and copper ions become copper metal.<br>
Electrons transfer from the zinc metal to the copper ions by moving from the zinc to copper along a wire.<br>
The potential difference or voltage reflects the greater activity of zinc over copper.<br>
The current flowing depends on the size and rate of the reaction.<br>

See: <a href="Commercial3.html#Thermistors">Thermocouple</a> (Commercial).<br> 
<a href="32.1.1.3.GIF">See diagram 4.1.1.3</a>: Voltage produced by heat, thermocouple.<br>
Voltage is produced by heating the joint (junction) where two unlike metals are joined.<br> 
When a length of most metals, e.g. copper, is heated at one end, some electrons move away from the hot end towards the cooler end.<br> 
However, in some metals, e.g. iron, some electrons move towards the hot end.<br> 
If the metals are connected, the electrons can cross from the iron to the copper at the hot junction, and from the copper through the current meter to the iron at the cold junction.<br> 
 This device is called a thermocouple.<br> 
 Use it to measure temperature, and as heat sensing devices in automatic temperature control equipment.<br> 
 Thermocouples can be subjected to greater temperatures than thermometers containing liquids.<br> 
 A thermocouple consists of two dissimilar metals, joined together at one end.<br> 
 When the junction of the two metals is heated or cooled a voltage is produced that can be correlated back to the temperature.<br> 
 The alloys used in thermocouples are commonly available as wire.<br> 
 A beaded wire thermocouple consists of two pieces of thermocouple wire joined together with a welded bead.<br> 
 A thermocouple probe consists of thermocouple wire housed inside a metallic tube.<br> 
 A thermocouple surface probe is used to measure the temperature of a solid surface.<br> 
The thermocouple is based on the Seebeck effect (thermoelectric effect): a conductor generates a voltage when in a thermal gradient.<br> 
 A thermocouple has two different wires or semiconductors joined at the ends to be a thermoelectric source of emf.<br> 
Experiment<br>
 1. Connect a voltmeter to the iron wires of two copper-iron wire junctions 
 hanging from a stand.<br> 
 Light the Bunsen burner and heat one of the junctions, watching the voltmeter.<br> 
 You can also immerse a junction in ice.<br> 
 2. Make a thermocouple coil magnet.<br> 
 Heat a thermocouple loop and the current produces a magnetic field that 
can be detected by a compass needle.<br> 
 3. Thermocouple magnet.<br> 
 Use a Bunsen burner to heat one side of a thermocouple magnet supporting 
 over 10 Kg.<br> 
 Heat and cool opposite sides of a large thermocouple then suspend a large 
weight from an electromagnet powered by the 
 thermocouple current.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="33.7.6.1H">33.7.6.1</a> Seebeck effect (thermoelectric effect)<br>
(Thomas Johann Seebeck, 1770-1831, Germany)<br>
"Thermoelectric device" ("Seebeck Effect", bismuth telluride), Peltier Device<br>
The Seebeck effect, when the wires are at different temperatures is used to detect very small differences in temperatures.<br> 
The Seebeck effect, an electromotive force is generated in a circuit containing junctions between dissimilar metals if these junctions are at different temperatures.<br> 
A thermocouple consists of two such dissimilar metals connected in series.<br> 
A thermocouple is a thermoelectric device for measuring temperature, consisting of two different metals joined at two points so that the junction develops a voltage dependent on the amount by which its temperature differs from that of the other end of each metal.<br> 
Experiment<br>
<a href="topicIndexCiCy.html#ConstantanH">Constantan wire</a><br>
Experiment<br>
Connect to a galvanometer two iron-copper junctions one in ice and the other in a flame.<br> 
Attach a voltmeter to the iron wires of two iron-copper junctions while they are differentially heated.<br> 
Place a twisted wire thermocouple in a flame and observe the current.<br> 
A thermoelectric generator is made from 150 constantan / nickel molybdenum thermocouples in series.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="33.7.6.2H">33.7.6.2</a> Peltier effect<br>
(Jean Charles Athanase Peltier, 1785-1845, France)<br>
 Thermoelectric ("Seebeck Effect", bismuth telluride) ("Peltier Effect", connect 5 V DC)<br>
The Peltier coefficient is the quantity of heat given out or absorbed, depending on the direction of the current at a junction between two conductors
or between a given material and a reference conductor when a unit of charge passes between them.<br> 
 The Peltier coefficients represent how much heat current is carried per 
unit charge through a given material.<br> 
The Peltier effect is used in thermoelectric refrigeration or heating.<br> 
Experiment<br>
 1. Cool a small test-tube of water in a Peltier device or dry ice / alcohol 
bath and use a thermocouple to record the temperature.<br> 
 Shake to freeze and the temperature will rise.<br> 
 A Peltier device is a very small solid state device that functions as 
heat pump made of layers of ceramic plates and bismuth telluride.<br> 
 Apply DC current to move heat from one side to the other so the cold 
side can cool a small electronic device.<br> 
 They contain no moving parts and no Freon refrigerant.<br> 
 2. Seebeck effect and Peltier effects<br>
Send current through a copper-iron-copper circuit for several seconds and immediately disconnect and switch to a galvanometer.<br> 
3. Make an antimony-bismuth junction and an apparatus to show heating and cooling due to the Peltier effect.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="33.7.6.3H">33.7.6.3</a> Thompson effect<br>
 The Thompson effect (Lord Kelvin, 1851, England)<br>
The existence of a temperature gradient along an electrical conductor causes a potential gradient in the same direction or contrary direction.<br> 
 Experiment<br>
 A flame moved along a long wire will push ahead current.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="33.7.6.4H">33.7.6.4</a> Thermopile<br>
See: <a href="Commercial3.html#Thermistors">Thermocouple</a> (Commercial).<br> 
A thermopile is a set of joined thermocouples.<br> 
A thermopile is made of thermocouple junction pairs connected electrically in series.<br> 
The absorption of thermal radiation by one of the thermocouple junctions, called the active junction, increases its temperature.<br> 
The differential temperature between the active junction and a reference junction kept at a fixed temperature produces an electromotive force directly
 proportional to the differential temperature created.<br> 
This effect is called a thermoelectric effect.<br> 
For more sensitivity, thermocouples are joined in series to make a thermopile.<br> 
Thermopiles do not respond to absolute temperature, but generate an output voltage proportional to a local temperature difference or temperature gradient.<br> 
Experiment<br>
A thermopile consists of four iron and four copper wires twisted to form seven junctions to produce a thermoelectric emf.<br> 
The end terminals connect to a galvanometer.<br> 
Use a hand held hair drier is a suitable source of heat to activate the thermopile.<br> 

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="33.5.01H">33.5.01</a> Power and energy<br
Power and energy, electrical equivalent of heat, power transmission, household power<br>
1. Electric current, I, ampere, A, potential difference, volt, V<br>
 Power = work done / time taken, P = W / t.<br>
 Charge transferred = current time, Q = It.<br>
 Power, P in watts = VI, volts × amps.<br>
 Power, P in watts = current<sup>2</sup> × resistance = I<sup>2</sup>R.<br>
 Power, P in watts = voltage<sup>2</sup> / resistance = V<sup>2</sup> / R<br>
2. Power and Energy, watt W = 1 joule per second, watts = volts × amps, filament lamps, fluorescent lamps, radiant electric fires, three heat switch,
 fuses, W (joules = Q (coulombs) × V (volts)<br>
Electrical energy, W, consumed by an electrical appliance is equal to the work done to move charge through the appliance.<br> 
 If potential difference is v volts and quantity of electricity passed = Q coulombs, the work done = QV joules.<br> 
 Charge (Q) = current (I) × time (t) so work done = QV = VIt joules.<br> 
3. Electric power is the rate of energy use, measured 
 in watts, W, the amount of energy that flows in one second.<br> 
 Electric power, P, is the rate at which electrical energy, supplied by batteries, thermocouples, photoelectric cells (photo-cells), generators, is converted
 to another form of energy.<br> 
 The unit of power is joules per second or watt, W.<br> 
 Power = work done / time taken, = Volts × Amperes, VI = joule / coulomb 
 × coulomb / second = joule / second = watt.<br> 
 So a 100 watt light globe, an incandescent lamp, consumes 100 joules 
of electrical energy per second.<br> 
 In this example "consumes" means converts electrical energy to heat energy 
and light energy.<br> 
 The amount of electric energy used by an electrical appliance, is equal 
to the work done to move charge through that appliance.<br> 
 The longer the appliance operates, the more electrical energy is used.<br> 
 All the electrical energy supplied to ohmic resistors is converted into 
heat.<br> 
 The I-V graph for an ohmic resistor is a straight line graph.<br> 
 Ohm's Law states that the ratio of the potential difference across the 
 conductor to the current flowing through it is constant, volt / amp = 
 ohm, V / I = R.<br> 
 Power = VI watt, IR watt.<br> 
 Some circuit elements, e.g. vacuum diode, do not have uniform I-V graphs 
 and do not have a constant value for resistance.<br> 
 Power systems, UK, 50 Hz 240 volts, RMS.<br> 
4. In high-voltage power lines, high tension power lines, the ohmic resistance of the wires causes some power to be dissipated as heat.<br> 
 To reduce this loss power, engineers use the best conductors, large diameter 
wires, the shortest possible route and the highest possible 
 voltage.<br> 
 If P<sub>loss</sub> = I<sup>2</sup>R, where P<sub>loss</sub> = power 
dissipated as heat (watts), I = line current (amperes), R = line resistance, 
 (ohms).<br> 
 If R remains constant, P<sub>load</sub> I<sup>2</sup>, where I = the 
net load, i.e. the total current used by all the power users.<br> 
 For voltage, I = P<sub>load</sub> / V, where P<sub>load</sub> = total
 power demanded by users.<br> 
 At a fixed power load, P<sub>loss</sub> = I<sup>2</sup>R, P<sub>loss</sub>
 = (P<sub>load</sub> / V)<sup>2</sup>R, = (P<sub>load</sub>)<sup>2</sup>R
 / V<sup>2</sup>.<br> 
 So increasing the voltage decreases the power loss.<br> 
Power loss could be further decreased by using direct current for long distance transmission, because direct current does not produce electromagnetic
 fields, another source of power line inefficiency, electromagnetic radiation loss.<br> 
However, direct current power transmission is costly to install, because it requires high voltage rectifiers at a generating plant and DC to AC inverters
 where high voltage has to be connected to low voltage lines to consumers.<br> 
 In USA, where households use alternating current at 117 volts and 234 volts RMS, step-down transformers reduce the voltage of high tension lines
carrying 100 K volts or more to a "municipal voltage", using large step-down transformers in buildings or on the ground in fenced-off areas.<br> 
Then smaller transformers on utility poles or underground, step down the "municipal voltage" to "household voltage" of 234 volts RMS as three
 separate AC waves, called phases.<br> 
Each wave of the three-phase power runs 120<sup>o</sup> out of phase, with the two other phases to form the three-phase AC power needed for large appliances, e.g. ovens and washing machines.<br> 
However, in USA the conventional wall outlets carry single phase AC electricity at 117 volts RMS.<br> 
5. DC is preferred for long distance transmission hauls, because of the economics of a DC line.<br> 
DC is more efficient than AC at high voltages and has lower line losses.<br> 
The DC line has lower losses, no reactive power is needed, and the power flow can be fully controlled.<br> 
Wire diameter is limited for AC transmission lines, because of the "skin effect" that prevents an AC current from penetrating to the centre of a large wire,
 whereas a DC line can be arbitrarily thick.<br> 
At 60 Hz, the skin effect becomes significant for wires greater in diameter than about an inch (2.54 cm).<br> 
Because of the skin effect in part, multiple wires arranged in a circular pattern and separated by polymer spacers are often used in high capacity
 high voltage AC transmission lines.<br> 
 Overhead HVDC powerlines can transport significantly more power for greater distances than AC lines, for two main reasons:<br>
* the effective voltage can be higher, and 2. the wires can be bigger.<br> 
* DC transmission lines become cost effective with AC lines at around 300 miles for overhead and 30 miles for underground power transmission.<br> 
 This is because the the cost of converter stations for a DC line are much greater than the cost of a transformer.<br>
 At those distances, the line costs equalize and for longer lines, DC is more efficient.<br>

 The megawatt-hour, MWh, is a unit of energy that measures the power consumed 
or produced by one megawatt for one hour.<br> 
 The megawatt (MW), is a unit of power that measures the rate at which 
 power is consumed or produced at any given moment in time.<br> 
 Megawatt hours (MWh) = megawatts (MW), x hours (h).<br>
 Megawatts (MW) = megawatt hours (MWh) / hours (h).<br> 
 One megawatt (MW) = one million watts, joules/second, W.<br>
 One megawatt (MW) = 1000 kilowatts, kW.<br>
 One gigawatt (GW) = 1000 megawatts.<br>
 In the State of Queensland, the long-term average wholesale price of 
electricity is AUD 45 to 50 per megawatt hour, MWh.<br> 
 The baseload generating capacity is about 7 600 MW, but more than 8 000 
MW is required to power the State at peak demand.<br> 
 Spare capacity of about 1 500 MW comes from higher cost peak generators.<br>

<a href="32.2.3.GIF">See diagram 32.2.3</a>: Electric kettle heating efficiency.<br>
Any kettle used to heat water can lose heat to its surroundings and to the materials from which it is constructed.<br> 
So the heat produced by the heat source does not only heat the water.<br>
Experiment 
You can measure the heat efficiency of an electric kettle by doing a simple experiment.<br> 
<b>Be careful!</b><br>
Be sure that water cannot come into contact with the power supply.<br> 
Some simple heating elements are bare wire and should not be used for this experiment!<br>
Do not operate an electric kettle with wet hands!
Be sure that students and teachers cannot be scalded by steam!<br>
* Record the power rating of the heater element.<br> 
* Measure and record the temperature of 500 mL of water and pour it into a kettle.<br> 
* Switch on the power supply to the kettle and start timing how long it takes the kettle to bring the water to boil.<br> 
* Switch off the power supply when the water boils, and record the time it took for the water to come to boil.<br> 
* Empty the kettle and allow the element to cool to room temperature then repeat steps 2, 3 and 4 and find the average time to bring the water to boil.<br> 
To calculate the efficiency of the kettle, find how much energy the water absorbed to bring it to boiling point.<br> 
Use the formula Q = mc (T<sub>f</sub> - T<sub>i</sub>), where m = mass of water, c = specific heat of water, T<sub>f</sub> = final temperature and 
T<sub>i </sub> = initial temperature.<br> 
Divide this value by the time it took to bring the water to boiling and you get the power consumed in boiling the water.<br> 
Divide this value by the power rating of the element to give the efficiency of the kettle.<br> 
The following example is based on a kitchen kettle with an element rating of 2, 200 watts:<br>
 m = 0.5 kg, c = 4186 J / kg<sup>o</sup>C, T<sub>f </sub>= 100<sup>o</sup>C, T<sub>i</sub> = 22<sup>o</sup>C.<br> 
 So Q = 0.5 × 4186 × (100 - 22) = 163, 254 Joules.<br>
The time taken to bring the water to boil was 94 seconds.<br> 
So the power consumed to boil the water = 163, 254 / 94 = 1, 737 Watts.<br>
For the efficiency of the kettle divide the power used to boil the water by the power output of the element and multiply by 100 to give a % value,
 i.e. (1, 737 / 2, 200) × 100 = 79%.<br>
The efficiency of the kitchen kettle is 79%, or 21% of the power output is wasted.<br>

A galvanometer is an instrument for detecting small electric currents by observing the deflection of a magnetic needle by an electric current in a
magnetic field.<br> 
Meters for measuring voltage or current are made from moving coil galvanometers.<br> 
To keep the maximum force acting on the moving coil, the magnetic field is drawn inwards by a "soft" iron core, making the field appear radial.<br> 
The moving coil turns against springs that carry the galvanometer current in and out of the coil, and return the coil to zero.<br> 
The moving coil turns a pointer across a scale, so that the scale reading is proportional to the current through the coil.<br> 
The current to be detected passes through a coil inside the instrument is in a magnetic field.<br> 
This causes the coil and the attached pointer to be deflected, the direction and size of the deflection depending upon the direction and size of the current.<br> 
There is a risk of sending a larger current through the galvanometer than is safe for the instrument.<br> 
However, the greater part of this current is made to "bypass" the galvanometer through a "protective shunt", as in the diagram.<br> 
A short length of fine, cotton covered copper wire serves as a convenient shunt.<br> 
This moving coil meter works on the same principle as a simple DC electric motor and is called the D'Arsonval movement after its inventor.<br> 
It consists of a stationary magnet and a moving coil.<br> 
When current flows through the coil the resultant magnetic field reacts with the magnetic field from the permanent magnet and causes the coil to rotate.<br> 
The greater the current the greater the rotation.<br> 
Experiment<br>
1. Mount a coil vertically on a phosphor bronze suspension that conducts current between the circuit under the test and the coil.<br> 
The phosphor bronze suspension also provides the restoring force when it twists balanced against the driving force of the coil's magnetic field.<br> 
In some galvanometers a coil spring below the moving coil, with an attached pointer, controls how far the coil turns and measures the current.<br> 
The direction of movement follows the right hand motor rule for electron flow, where first finger points towards from North to South, the second 
finger points in the direction of electron flow in the conductor, the thumb points to the direction of motion of the conductor.<br>

<a href="32.7.2.4.GIF">See diagram 32.7.2.4</a>: Hot wire ammeter.<br>
In a hot wire metre you pass the current through a platinum alloy hot wire.<br> 
When current passes through the wire, the wire expands due to the heat effect of the current.<br> 
The expansion is taken up by the spring metal strip.<br> 
The spring metal strip is much like a spring in mechanical watch that it always maintains a tendency of stretch that pulls a silk thread tightly.<br> 
Wind the silk thread around a small pulley attached to the pointer.<br> 
When the silk strip moves, it pulls the pulley resulting in the deflection of the pointer.<br> 
Tie the other end of the silk strip to a phosphor bronze wire attached to the hot wire.<br> 
The silk strip could not be connected directly to the wire, as it would burn when large current passed through the wire.<br> 
The phosphor bronze wire is insulated from heat.<br> 
So the hot wire expands as the current passes through it and loosens the phosphor bronze wire, stretch the spring metal strip through silk's transfer.<br> 
Finally, silk, pulley and pointer move in turn.<br> 
In view of energy, first the electric energy transforms into heat energy.<br> 
Then heat energy transforms into kinetic energy of pointer and potential energy.<br>

<a href="32.2.66.GIF">See diagram 32.2.66</a>: Tangent galvanometer.<br>
The tangent galvanometer measures current flowing through a vertical circular coil of known number of turns of insulated wire.<br> 
The magnetic effect of this current at right angles to the plane of the coil is measured by an aluminium pointer attached to a turning bar magnet.<br> 
The galvanometer is made horizontal with adjustable legs and a spirit level.<br> 
If the strength of the magnetic field at the centre of the coil is H oersted, and the horizontal component of the earth's magnetic field at that point is
H<sub>1 </sub>oersted,<br>
and θ, (Greek <i>theta</i> θ). is the angle of deflection of the pivoted magnet, H = H<sub>1</sub> tan θ.<br> 
H, is a constant at a particular place so H is proportional to tan θ.<br> 
H is proportional to I, so I is proportional to tan θ or I = k tan θ.<br> 
The symbol k represents the reduction factor constant of the tangent galvanometer, using two turns of the coil.<br> 
Experiment<br>
Place the tangent galvanometer away from any magnetic fields from other devices in the circuit.<br> 
Rotate the tangent galvanometer until the plane of the coil is in the magnetic meridian as shown by the pivoted magnet, and one end of the aluminium
pointer is over the 0<sup>o</sup> mark.<br> 
Check that the tangent galvanometer is horizontal.<br>

 The ammeter is an instrument that measures an electric current.<br> 
The resistance of an ammeter must be very small so that when it is placed in a circuit it will not diminish the current it is intended to measure.<br> 
The ammeter is always placed in series in the circuit, and to make the pointer deflect the right way, its positive terminal must be connected to the
 positive side of the circuit.<br> 
An ammeter is a galvanometer with a low value resistor placed in parallel across its terminals so that the largest current in the circuit causes full scale
 deflection and no more.<br>

A voltmeter measures electric potential in volts.<br> 
A voltmeter measures "electron pressure", potential or electromotive force (emf ), the ability of a cell to move electrons around a circuit, potential difference,
with SI unit the volt.<br> 
The voltmeter is an instrument that measures the potential difference between two points in a circuit.<br> 
The resistance of a voltmeter must be very high so that when placed across part of a circuit it does not divert a lot of current from the main circuit.<br> 
The voltmeter is always placed in parallel with (i.e. across) the resistance to measure the potential difference between its ends.<br> 
When, connecting, make sure that you connect the positive terminal to the positive side of the circuit.<br> 
A voltmeter is a sensitive galvanometer with a high value resistor placed in series so that the largest voltage in the circuit causes full scale deflection
 and no more, i.e. a shunted galvanometer.<br> 
Experiment<br>
Connect a voltmeter across a resistor to measure resistance and power consumption.<br> 
Connect an ammeter in series in the circuit to measure the current flowing through the ohmic resistor.<br> 
The voltmeter counts how many joules each coulomb delivers as it travels through a lamp or motor.<br> 
A voltmeter measures the energy transferred from electrical energy to heat or mechanical energy.<br> 
Volts = joules per coulomb, or volts = joules of energy transferred from electrical form of energy to other forms of energy in that part of the circuit for
 every coulomb passing through it.<br> 
Resistance value of a resistor, R, = V / I, ohm = volt / amps.<br> 
Power consumed by resistor, P = V × I = volt × amps.<br>
Resistance, R, of a material increases with length, decreases with cross-section area, and depends on the resistivity quality of the material.<br> 
 R = resistivity × length / area, e.g. resistivity copper = 1.7 × 10<sup>-8 </sup>ohm metre, rubber = 10<sup>13 </sup>ohm metre.<br>
