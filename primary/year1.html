Teach the children to explain the difference between living things and non-living things.<br>
 Use different living things and nonliving things.<br>
 1. What is the difference between things that are living and things that are not living?<br>
 [Living things 1. need air and water 2. can grow in size 3. can change shape and 4. can produce baby animals or baby plants<br>
 5. can move by themselves 6. can eat food or make food.<br>
 Non-living things 1. do not need air or water 2. 3. usually remains the same size and shape 4. cannot produce a baby<br>
 5. cannot move by themselves, and 6. do not eat food or make their own food.<br>
 Make a list on the chalkboard.]<br>
 2. Were some nonliving things alive in the past? [Yes.<br>
 For example, wood is a nonliving thing, but in the past it was part of a living tree.]<br>
 3. Classify the following things into 1. living things 2. nonliving. 
[Use * to mark things that were living, but are now nonliving.]<br>

 4. Some examples of living and nonliving things:<br>
 Most of your hair is dead, but the root of your hair is living.<br>
 Water is nonliving, but all living things contain water and living things such as fish live in water.<br>
 Paper is nonliving, but they make it from pieces of wood that were once part of a living tree.<br>
 Collect living and nonliving things from the school grounds.<br>
 Classify the items as you did in part three of this lesson.<br>
 Explain how you know whether something is living or nonliving.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="1.2H">1.2</a> Animals and plants<br>

 Use examples of plants and animals.<br>
 1. See, and, perhaps, touch examples of animals and plants:<br>
 Animals: cat, dogs, ants, lizards, fish, birds, butterfly, mouse.<br>
 Plants: grass, pine trees, bananas, mango, sugar cane, weeds.<br>
 Say the name of each plant and animal and where they are found.<br>
 2. What are the differences between plants and animals seen in the class?<br>
 Animals can move, plants cannot move, but wind or water can carry seeds.<br>
 Animals have different colours.<br>
 Plants leaves are mostly green.<br>
 Animals lay eggs or have babies, plants make seeds.<br>
 Animals eat plants and other animals.<br>
 Plants make their food from the air, the soil, and the sun.<br>
 Animals have a head, body and legs, plants have roots, stem and leaves.<br>
 3. Play the animal and plant game.<br>
 Divide the class into pairs.<br>
 Point to one child and say "animal" That child has to say something about animals, e.g. "they can move".<br>
 The other child of the pair has to say the difference with plants, e.g. "they cannot move".<br>
 4. Nature Walk<br>
 How many kinds of plants and animals can you see?<br>
 Remember that some funguses, e.g. mushroom, toadstools, bracket fungus on dead trees, are neither an animal nor a plant.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="1.4H">1.4</a> Different plants<br>
<a href="../images/64.3.gif">See diagram 64.3</a>: Cassava<br>
 Teach the children to recognize some features of different plants.<br>
 Use different kinds of plants for this lesson.<br>
 Some plants should be weeds and some plants should have parts you can eat, e.g. potato.<br>
 1. How do you recognize plants?<br>
 [Plants have green leaves, live in sunlight, do not eat food, but they make their food from the air and the soil, they cannot move, but their seeds can move, they have baby plants inside seeds.]<br>
 2. How are plants different from each other?<br>
 [Some plants are very big and some are very small, some are hard and woody.<br>
 Some are soft and can be bent, some have flowers and some have no flowers, some have fruit you can eat.<br>
 Some plants have no fruit that you can eat.]<br>
 3. Name the plants you know.<br>
 4. Hold up different plants and point to them.<br>
 Is it a plant?<br>

 Collect plants to bring back to the classroom and describe.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="1.5H">1.5</a> Plant pictures<br>
 Teach the children to make different shapes using flowers and leaves.<br>
 Use leaves and flowers.<br>
 Leaf and flower Pictures.<br>
 Children become more familiar with the shapes of leaves and flowers when they can use them to make shapes.<br>
 1. Give each pair different leaves and flowers.<br>
 Describe the shapes of different leaves and flowers, e.g. big and round flower, long and fat leaf.<br>
 2. Use the leaves and flowers to make shapes:<br>
 Can you make a house?<br>
 Can you make a boy or girl?<br>
 Can you make a boat?<br>
 3. For the next lesson, bring leaves and flowers from home.<br>
 You will have a competition for the best leaf and flower picture.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="1.6H">1.6</a> Different leaves<br>
<a href="../images/9.66.2.gif">See diagram 9.66.2</a>: Shapes of leaves<br>
 Teach the children to describe different leaves.<br>
 1. Each group go outside to collect many different leaves from all kinds of plants.<br>
 2. Count the number of different types of leaves each group collected.<br>
 1. Are all the leaves the same shape and size?<br>
 Describe the differences.<br>
 2. Are all the leaves green? [No.]<br>
 Name the other colours.<br>
 3. Name some different trees and describe their leaves.<br>
 [Leaves are the factories in the plant to for make food.<br>
 Most leaves are green.<br>
 They have veins that bring water to the leaves from the roots.<br>
 Also, veins carry food made by the leaves to the other parts of the plant.<br>
 Some leaves have parallel veins and others have a network of veins.<br>
 A simple leaf is in one piece.<br>
 It has one leaf blade only, which you may divide into sections that are not completely separate.<br>
 A compound leaf has many separate leaflets.<br>
 Each leaflet has a separate stalk, but all the leaflets are joined to a common leaf stalk.]<br>
 4. Leaf Collection<br>
 Collect different shaped leaves and classify them.<br>
 Before the lesson collect different shaped leaves as in 2. below.<br>
 Collect some extra leaves for use in 3. Groups of four children.<br>
 Give each group a pile of leaves from different plants.<br>
 Show the children that all leaves have three parts:<br>
 4.1 a thin and flat part; [leaf blade]<br>
 4.2 a thin and round part, like a handle; [petiole]<br>
 4.3 a little knob at the end of the handle.<br>
 This is where the leaf joins the stem. [the leaf base]<br>
 2. Divide the leaves into piles:<br>
 Pile 1. Hand shape, e.g. chilli, hibiscus, taro.<br>
 Pile 2. Long and thin shape, e.g. mango, coconut leaflets.<br>
 Pile 3. Dented shape, passion fruit, snake gourd, papaya.<br>
 Pile 4. Divided into little leaves, e.g. Pueraria, cassava.<br>
 3. Look at the extra leaves.<br>
 Which pile do you belong to?<br>
 4. Display different leaves on a wall board.<br>
 5. Trace the shape of different leaves on paper.<br>
 Can you colour them?<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="1.7H">1.7</a> Knocking sounds<br>
 Teach the children to make different sounds by knocking things together, identify sounds that are loud or soft, high or low.<br>
 Which musical instruments make sounds by knocking things together? [Drum, bells, xylophone.]<br>
 Use things that children can hit together: pencils, cardboard boxes, knife or other metal object, bottles, rulers, tins.<br>
 Also, collect some musical instruments: bells, drums, rattles.<br>
 1. Knock together pairs of the same thing, e.g. two pencils together or two boxes together, to make a soft sound and a loud sound.<br>
 Then knock together pairs of different things, e.g. a pencil and a tin, a marble and a box, a ruler against a tin.<br>
 2. Make as many different knocking sounds as you can.<br>
 Which group can make the greatest number of different knocking sounds?<br>
 3. Sounds game<br>
 Take turns in shutting your eyes and guessing what two things are being knocked together by other members of the group.<br>
 4. Fill a bottle with water and hit with a metal object such as a knife.<br>
 Listen to the sound.<br>
 Pour out some water and hit the bottle again.<br>
 Is the sound the same? [It sounds a higher note.]<br>
 Keep pouring out water and hitting the bottle until it is empty.<br>
 5. Ring a bell and let the children touch it.<br>
 Hit a drum and let the children touch the skin.<br>
 Say "hum" for a long time and put your finger on your throat.<br>
 What can you feel? [The bell, the drum skin, and the throat are moving in and out.<br>
 They are vibrating.]<br>
 Hit the drum then push your hand on it.<br>
 Or ring the bell then grab it tightly.<br>
 What happens? [The sound stops.]<br>
 6. Which musical instruments make sound by hitting? [Drum, rattles, bells, castanets.]<br>
 7. Keep very quiet.<br>
 Then tell the children to describe all sounds they heard when they were quiet.<br>
 8. Make simple musical instruments.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="1.8H">1.8</a> String sounds<br>
<a href="../images/26.194.gif">See diagram 26.194</a>: Stretched rubber band | 
<a href="../images/26.2.1.gif">See diagram: 26.2.1</a>: Rubber band over ruler / box<br>
 Teach the children to make sounds from a ruler and rubber band, show how to change the sounds made by strings.<br>
 Use rulers, rubber bands, open tins.<br>
 1. Hold a ruler flat on the desk with about half of it over the edge.<br>
 Make a musical sound by pulling up the end of the ruler and letting it go.<br>
 Press down firmly on the part of the ruler over the desk with one hand then pull up the part that hangs over the edge with the other hand.<br>
 2. Does the ruler move? [Yes.]<br>
 Does it make a sound? [Yes.]<br>
 Can you hear the sound when the ruler stops moving? [No.]<br>

 If the length of the ruler over the edge is longer or shorter, is the sound higher or lower? [The shorter the length over the edge, the<br>
 higher the note.]<br>
 3. Stretch rubber bands between your fingers then pluck them to make a sound.<br>
 4. Make a guitar by stretching rubber bands around an open box or a drink-can or a big plastic drink bottle cut in half lengthways.<br>
 Pluck the rubber bands to make them vibrate and make a sound.<br>
 5. Use long and a short rubber bands that have the same width.<br>
 Which rubber band vibrates quicker? [The shorter rubber band vibrates quicker]<br>
 Which rubber band gives the higher musical note? [The shorter rubber band gives the higher musical note.]<br>
 6. Use a thin and a fat rubber band that have the same length.<br>
 Which rubber band vibrates quicker? [The thin rubber band vibrates quicker.]<br>
 Which rubber band gives the higher musical note? (The thin rubber band gives the higher musical note.]<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="1.9H">1.9</a> Shadow game<br>
<a href="../images/28.105.3.1.gif">See diagram 28.105.3.1</a>: Shadow gamezzz<br>
<a href="../images/28.105.3.gif">See diagram 28.105.3</a>: Shadows, umbra, penumbra<br>
 Teach the children to show how to make shadows, play games with shadows, recognize the light is necessary to make shadows.<br>
 Use a bright sunny day and level ground, a stick one metre long.<br>
 The Jumping on shadows game is best played in the early morning or late afternoon when shadows are long.<br>
 1. Play the jumping on shadows game.<br>
 Fix a stick in the ground that measures one metre above ground level.<br>
 Put a small stone on the end of the shadow of the stick every half hour during the day.<br>
 At the end of the day see where the shadow has been.<br>
 2. Stand so that your shadow is: in front of them, behind them.<br>
 3. Touch your shadow, jump on your shadow, shake hands with your shadow, catch shadows on your hands.<br>
 4. Work in groups and try to make shadows with four arms and four legs, six arms and six legs.<br>
 5. Show how to form shadows of animals with your hands such as butterflies and birds.<br>
 Hold your hands about 50 cm above the ground. Let the children try in pairs.<br>
 Draw around the shadows with sticks.<br>
 How can you make shadows bigger or smaller by moving your hands? [The closer the hands are to the ground,<br>
 the smaller the shadow.]<br>
 6. Put a stone on the ground.<br>
 Show that you can make the shadow of your hands touch it.<br>
 Walk away from the stone so that the shadow hand still touches it.<br>
 7. Stand on a path with your back to the light.<br>
 Walk along the path away from the light.<br>
 Compare how fast you are walking with how fast the top of your shadow is moving away from you.<br>
 8. Draw a circle about five metres across on the ground.<br>
 Choose four children to show how the game is played.<br>
 One is the chaser.<br>
 The other five run around within the circle.<br>
 The chaser has to jump on the shadow of another children and shout "STOP".<br>
 That child then leaves the circle until the game is over.<br>
 The last child caught becomes the chaser in the next game.<br>
 8. Make a shadow with circular hoop, e.g. a bicycle wheel tyre.<br>
 The shadow can be a circle, an ellipse, a straight line.<br>
 9. What is needed to make shadows outside? [The sun, and an object that stops the light from the sun reaching the ground,<br>
 e.g. a stone, but not a piece of glass.<br>
 The stone is opaque, but the glass is transparent.]<br>
 Why are there no shadows on a dull day? [The sun is covered by cloud.]<br>
 Can clouds have shadows? [Yes.]<br>
 Can you see your shadow in the shade or when you are standing under a 
tree? [No.]<br>
 What kind of day do you need to see shadows? [A sunny day.]<br>
 What does your shadow look like? [Draw it with chalk on the ground.]<br>
 How can you make the shadow of your hand on the ground bigger or smaller?
 [The shadow is smallest when your hand is closest to the ground.]<br>
 What do you need to make shadows inside the house? [A light and an object.]<br>
 Show the shadow of your hand on the wall.<br>
 Can you make funny shadows on the wall? [Use your hand to make a dog shadow and<br>
 use two hands to make a butterfly shadow.]<br>
 What are shadows? [If you put an opaque object in the path of the light, it blocks the light that hits it.<br>
 Because light does not bend or go around corners, the area behind the object will receive no light and be dark.<br>
 The dark area will have the same shape as the object.<br>
 The dark area is the shadow.<br>
 Light from the sun causes all opaque objects to form shadows.<br>
 Other sources of light, e.g. candles and torches, can also form shadows.]<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="1.10H">1.10</a> Spinning picture, Thaumatrope, persistence of vision illusion<br>
<a href="../images/28.143.gif">28.143</a> Spinning picture, persistence of vision illusion<br>
 Teach the children to make a spinning picture so that two separate pictures appear as one.<br>
 This experiment is called the persistence of vision illusion or thaumatrope.<br>
 The illusion occurs, because the retina of the eye retains an image for about 1/16 of a second.<br>
 The movie industry uses 24 frames (pictures) per second, FPS.<br>
 You will need: pieces of light cardboard, scissors, coloured pencils or paints or crayons, reel of cotton thread or thin string.<br>
 Suggested Pictures: FRONT / BACK | A bird in a / cage. | A pig behind a / fence. | A fish in a / bowl. | A boy in a / tree. |<br>
 The picture on the back must be upside down.<br>
 The piece of cardboard should be about 10 cm × 8 cm.<br>
 When the card is spinning very fast an image of each picture forms in your eyes at the same time so you see the two pictures as one.<br>
 The image of an object remains in the eye for a short period of time, a fraction of a second.<br>
 So if separate photographs are taken of a moving object a person seeing the separate photographs flashed sequentially on a screen<br>
 see the continuous motion of the object, not the separate images.<br>
 This phenomenon is called persistence of vision - the illusion of continuous motion instead of separate images.<br>
 A cinema film run at 24 frames per second.<br>
 The inventor of the first spinning picture in 1824 called it a thaumatrope, "wonder turner".<br>
 1. Give out the materials to them.<br>
 2. Show your completed spinning picture to them.<br>
 Show how to make it spin.<br>
 3. Draw the first picture on one side of the card, draw the second picture, upside down, on the other side of the card.<br>
 Make two holes on each side of the card, thread and tie cotton into these holes.<br>
 4. Spin the cards by pulling outwards on the string.<br>
 5. If you spin the card slowly how many pictures do you see? [2. ]<br>
 If you spin the card quickly how many pictures do you see? [1. ]<br>
 6. A moving picture can be made by drawing a figure in different positions on successive pages of a book called a flip book.<br>
 Where you flick through this book, the figure appears to move.<br>
 When the Sydney Harbour Bridge was being constructed photographs were taken of it from the same place every few days.<br>
 Later these photographs were transferred to a flip book so that children could flip through the book and see the bridge growing<br>
 steadily until it reached full size.<br>
 Draw a simple picture of a horse with four feet.<br>
 Then draw more pictures on same size piece of paper of the same body and head, but change the position of the feet.<br>
 Put the pages together to make a flip book.<br>
 Flip though the flip book and see the movement of the feet.<br>
 This method is used to make cartoons, e.g. Mickey Mouse.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="1.11H">1.11</a> Mirror game<br>
<a href="../images/28.109.1.gif">See diagram 28.109.1</a>: Lateral inversion<br>
 Teach the children to see things by using a mirror.<br>
 Use mirrors and some objects like bottle tops, stones, flowers, pencils.<br>
 1. Give out one mirror to each group.<br>
 Look at the edge of the mirror.<br>
 Describe what you see. [A piece of glass with one side covered by silver paint.]<br>
 2. Reflect the light from the sun to make it shine on the classroom room.<br>
 Do not let the children shine the mirror into their eyes.<br>
 3. Write these numbers on the chalkboard.<br>
 Tell the children to look at them with their mirrors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.<br>
 Which numbers look the same in the mirror? [0, 1, 8.]<br>
 4. Write these letters on the chalkboard.<br>
 Tell the children to look at the letters with their mirrors: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T.<br>
 Which letters look the same in the mirror? [A, H, I, M, O, T.]<br>
 5. Look into the mirror and touch one eye with your finger.<br>
 Which eye is touched when you look in the mirror?<br>
 [If you touch your right eye, this eye appears to be on the left side of the face in the mirror.<br>
 The image is laterally inverted.]<br>

 Teach the children to observe how we are the same and how we are different.<br>
 This lesson is designed to help young children to make controlled observations about other children.<br>
 1. Children sit on the floor together and later break into two groups at different ends of the classroom.<br>
 In what ways are you all the same?<br>
 [A. We all have the same physical features: two eyes, one nose, two ears, two arms, two legs.]<br>
 [B. We all have the same needs: eating, breathing, drinking, sleeping, going to the toilet]<br>
 [C. We all have the same kinds of feelings: happy, sad, interested, bored.]<br>
 2. In what ways are you different?<br>
 [A. We can be boy or girl.<br>
 We can have different height, hair length, eye colour, skin colour.]<br>
 [B. We are all always breathing, but we have the other needs at different times.]<br>
 [C. We have different feelings at different times.]<br>
 3. What differences are easy to see?<br>
 [Physical differences, e.g. tall or short.]<br>
 Which children are short? | Which children are tall? | Which children have curly hair? | Which children have straight hair?<br>
 Describe all them in the class.<br>
 4. Play the Difference Game.<br>
 Call out a difference and point to one end of the classroom.<br>
 Those children run to the place where you point.<br>
 The other children run to the other end of the classroom.<br>
 For example, call out: "girl" or "curly hair" or "two eyes" or "wears a dress" or "wears shoes" or "is breathing" or "is sleeping"<br>
 or "is happy" or "does not listen"!<br>
 Did you always run to the end of the classroom? [No]<br>
 When were all them the same and when were they different? [For some things, e.g. breathing, we are all the same, but for many things<br>
 we are different]<br>
 5. Look at the palms of the hands.<br>
 Draw the lines.<br>
 Do some children have the same lines? | Which children have the same lines? Which children have different lines?<br>
 Some people believe that they can understand the character of a person from observing the lines in the palm of the hand and bumps<br>
 between them.<br>
 The main lines are given names like "heart line", "head line" "life line".<br>
 This belief is called palmistry or chirognomy and has no basis in science, but it is a very old belief and occurs in many countries.<br>

 Use suitable objects such as pineapple or other fruit, or jam, sugar, water or kerosene.<br>
 Be careful about asking the children to taste things.<br>
 Our senses are any of the special body faculties, especially sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch, commonly called "the five senses",<br>
 which allow us to perceive external objects and stimuli.<br>
 Other senses allow us to perceive internal stimuli relating to balance and motion<br>
 1. Play the senses game.<br>

 Put them in the feelie bags so they cannot see the objects.<br>
 1. Play the feelie bag game.<br>
 This game is not a guessing game, you must:<br>
 1.1 describe what you feel, e.g. "it feels soft", "it feels round",<br>
 1.2 then say what they think the object is, e.g. "it is a bottle top".<br>

 | <a href="../images/2.1.1.gif">See diagram 2.1.1</a>: Length 2<br>
 Teach the children to conserve length by showing that the position of two sticks does not change their size.<br>
 Young children do not conserve length.<br>
 They do not understand that an object can only get longer or shorter by adding something to it or taking something away.<br>
 They think that an object can change in length when they change its position.<br>
 Before their children start measurement, they must think like this:<br>
 "It looks longer in that position, but it cannot be longer, because I did not add anything to it", or<br>
 "It looks shorter in that position, but it cannot be shorter, because I did not take anything away from it".<br>
 The following test will help you to know if their children are thinking like this.<br>
 The answer to every question is "yes".<br>
 You will need for each group: two sticks, equal in length, 15 cm long, or two pencils equal in length.<br>
 1. Put the two sticks side by side, with a space between them.<br>
 Are the sticks the same length? [Yes]<br>
 If the child answers "No", let the child pick up the sticks, compare them, and then put the sticks back in the same position.<br>
 If the child answers "Yes", move one stick about 4 cm to the right.<br>
 Tell the child again: "Are the sticks the same length?<br>
 " If the answer is "No", ask "Which is longer? and "Why is it longer?<br>
 Let the child compare the sticks.<br>
 If the child answers "Yes", ask the child "Why?"<br>
 The child should always answer "Yes, the sticks are still the same length, only their position has changed".<br>
 3. Repeat the question, but move one stick to the right and the other stick to the left.<br>
 4. Now move the sticks at right angles to each other when you change their position from that shown in No. 1.<br>
 5. Ask the child: "Are the sticks the same length? " [Yes]<br>
 Put one stick standing up instead of moving it sideways.<br>
 "Are they still the same length? " [Yes]<br>
 6. Get eight sticks of chalk or pencils that all have the same length.<br>
 Put them in two equal rows.<br>
 When them are sure that the two rows are the same length then arrange the sticks in the following way.<br>
 "Are the two rows the same length" [Yes]<br>
 "Explain their answers." [If them think that one row is longer than the other, replace the sticks in the original position]<br>

 3. Pacing Game<br>
 Divide the class into two groups.<br>
 Send each group to a tree.<br>
 Call out the name of one child in each group.<br>
 When you say "go", the child walks towards the other tree counting the paces.<br>
 The winners walk the same number of paces.<br>
 4. Divide the class into two groups outside the classroom door.<br>
 Each group walks around the classroom in different directions and counting paces until they come back to the door.<br>
 Is the number of paces the same? [Yes.]<br>

 After a few days the plant grows towards the light.<br>
 Draw the plant growing towards the light.<br>
 7. Leave a stone or piece of wood on the grass.<br>
 Look under it after a few days.<br>
 What do you see? [The grass becomes yellow when it loses its green colour.<br> 
Later the grass dies.]<br>
 8. Do any plants grow better in the shade? [Young plants need some shade to protect them from the hot sun, but they cannot grow in<br>
 the dark.]<br>

 Take some juicy stems or leaves to the classroom.<br>
 1. Show the juicy stems or leaves.<br>
 Squeeze them until some juice comes out.<br>
 What is coming out? [Water.]<br>
 Plants contain lots of water.<br>
 2. How do you show that plants need water? [Set up an experiment.<br>
 Give some plants water and the others no water.<br>
 The plants given no water will droop down and wilt.]<br>
 3. Draw two plants:<br>
 One plant given plenty of water<br>
 One plant that has wilted, because it was given no water<br>
 4. Can plants die, because of too much water? [If there is too much water in the soil, the roots cannot breathe and the plant will die.]<br>
 5. Pour some water on the soil and then dig down to see where it went.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="1.33H">1.33</a> Plants need soil<br>
 Plants need soil for the following reasons:<br>
 1. Soil holds up the plants.<br>
 It supports them and holds them firmly.<br>
 2. Soil holds water for the plants.<br>
 Plants need water to grow.<br>
 3. Soil holds foods for the plants.<br>
 Plants must have these plant foods or they cannot grow.<br>
 Teach the children to show that plants need good soil to grow well.<br>
 Use examples of plants growing in good garden soil and plants growing in poor sandy or gravel soil with little organic matter.<br>
 1. Show plants growing in good and bad soil.<br>
 What differences can you see ? [Differences in the size of the plant, whether there are flowers or fruits, size of the fruit, any diseases.]<br>
 2. Why do plants need soil? [Soil is needed to hold the plants up, to give the plants water, and to give the plants food.]<br>
 3. What are the three things all plants need to make them grow well? [Sunlight, water, good soil.]<br>
 4. Where do you find good soil and bad soil? [good soil in the forest, near rivers, new gardens on slopes, near the beach, old gardens.]<br>

<a href="../images/6.26.gif">See diagram 6.26</a>: Soil profiles<br>
 Teach the children to show the difference between good and bad soil.<br>
 1. Take the children to a place where there is good soil with small plants growing in it.<br>
 Dig a hole about half metre deep. [What you see when you look at the side of the hole from the inside is called the soil profile.]<br>
 2. Show the two main layers of the soil: the topsoil and the subsoil.<br>
 What differences can you see? [The topsoil is narrower and darker and contains most of the roots of small plants.<br>
 The subsoil is very deep and lighter and only the roots of big trees are in it.]<br>
 Measure the depth of the topsoil with your finger.<br>
 3. Now move to some bad soil and dig a hole.<br>
 What difference do you see between the bad soil and the good soil? [The topsoil is thinner or there is none at all. It contains fewer<br>
 roots of small plants.]<br>
 4. Dig holes in different places in the school garden and describe differences in the depth of topsoil.<br>
 Where do you find the most / the least topsoil? [You find most topsoil where there is plenty of plant cover.<br>
 You find least topsoil where there is little plant cover or on slopes.]<br>
 Feel good soil<br>
 Teach the children to describe the feel of good soil and then understand the importance of rotting leaves.<br>
 Use a place where lots of leaves are rotting into the soil.<br>
 1. Show the rotting leaves.<br>
 Let the children feel leaves 1.1 that are not yet rotten, 1.2 that are rotten.<br>
 What is the difference between the feel of the living leaves and the rotten leaves? [The living leaves feel smooth.<br>
 The rotten leaves feel sticky.]<br>
 2. What is the feel of the topsoil? [It feels sticky.]<br>
 What happens to the rotten leaves? [They go into the soil.]<br>
 What colour are the rotten leaves? [Black.]<br>
 Is the subsoil black? [No.]<br>
 Why is the subsoil not black? [There are no rotten leaves in it.]<br>
 3. What is the difference between good soil and bad soil? [Good soil has lots of topsoil.]<br>
 Why is the topsoil so good for plants? [It had rotten leaves in it.]<br>
 4. How do rotten leaves make the soil better?<br>
 4.1 They give plant food to the soil.<br>
 4.2 They make soil softer and easier to dig.<br>
 4.3 The soil sticks together and holds water for the plants.]<br>
 5. The rotten leaves form humus.<br>
 This is the black sticky substance found in the topsoil.<br>
 Subsoil does not feel sticky, because there is no humus in it.<br>
 6. Where do you find good soil and bad soil?<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="1.35H">1.35</a> Green leaves for health<br>
 Teach the children to explain the importance of amaranths, ferns, kankong, and other green leaves in the diet.<br>
 Before the lesson tell the children to bring different kinds of green leaves which people eat.<br>
 1. The green leaves of many plants can be eaten.<br>
 If the leaves are cooked quickly they can be an important part of the diet of children, because they are healthy foods.<br>
 Children should eat lightly cooked leaves every day.<br>
 Examples of edible leaves: Kumara, taro, beans, pumpkin tips, wong bok, fern, kankong, watercress, chilli, bok choi, hibiscus<br>
 cabbage, basella, comfrey, pit, tulip tree.<br>
 These greens may be more healthy than introduced vegetables such as cabbage and lettuce.<br>
 3. Amaranths or pig weed usually grows wild, but it can be grown in gardens.<br>
 Collect seeds by rubbing the seed head between the hands.<br>
 The seeds should be dried for a few weeks then sprinkled onto damp soil.<br>
 It is harvested first by thinning then eating the plants pulled out.<br>
 Later the leaves can be pulled off.<br>
 4. About the different kinds of green leaves eaten in the home.<br>
 Write a list of them on the chalk board.<br>
 Show the children Amaranths growing in the gardens nearby.<br>
 Show them how to harvest and plant seed.<br>
These green leaves should be part of your diet every day, because they contain healthy foods.<br>
 5. Collect the seeds or cuttings of different kinds of greens used by local people and plant them in the garden.<br>

 2. What can you see when you use the magnifier? [You can see the parts of the soil.]<br>
 3. Are the earth particles all separate or are some particles stuck together, like crumbs? [Some of it forms crumbs.]<br>
 The black sticky stuff is called humus.<br>
 It binds together some stone particles to form crumbs.<br>
 Good soil has crumbs of soil particles.<br>
 4. What colour is the soil?<br>
 Rub some wet soil on paper, what is the colour? [The colour is red-brown and other colours.]<br>
 Let the paper dry.<br>
 Does it change colour? [Yes.]<br>

<a href="../images/12.305.2.gif">See diagram 12.305.2</a>: Air supports water in a glass tube<br>
 Teach the children to pick up water and carry it using a straw.<br>
 Use drinking straws (or the petiole of a papaya leaf, or the hollow stem of grass), a bucket of water and a rag. 
<hr width="100%" size="2">1. Press your left index finger against the bottom end of the straw. Pour water into the straw or dip it into a bucket of water.<br>
 Dry the outside of the straw.<br>
 Press your right index finger on the top end of the straw.<br>
 Take away your left finger from the bottom end.<br>
 The water will stay in the straw.<br>
 Is there any water in the straw? [Yes.]<br>
 Raise their right index finger and the water will drop out.<br> 
<hr width="100%" size="2">2. Give each group a straw.<br>

 Each child has to pick up some water with the straw and carry it across to a jar.<br>
 The group that carries the most water to their jar wins the game. 
<hr width="100%" size="2">4. Medicine dropper<br>
 Hold water in the straw held vertically by covering the top end with the index finger.<br>
 Bend the finger slightly to let one drop at a time fall into the bucket.<br>
 The straw is now being used as a medicine dropper.<br>
 In a laboratory liquids are transferred in the same way using a pipette. 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">5. Drinking with a straw<br>
 Dip the end of a straw in water in a glass and suck it half way up the straw.<br>
 Put the index finger over the top of the straw and raise the straw above the water.<br>
 Air pressure is in all directions, down, sideways and up.<br>
 When you suck on the straw you take some air above the water into your mouth.<br>
 So the air pressure down on the surface of the water in the straw is less than the air pressure on the surface of the water in the glass.<br>
 If you remove your finger from the top of the straw, the air pressure
 above and below the water in the straw is the same, so the water<br>
 falls down.<br>
 So if you use a straw to "suck" a drink into your mouth, you are removing the air inside the straw to allow air pressure to push the<br>
 drink into your mouth. 
<hr width="100%" size="2">6. Water drop game<br>
