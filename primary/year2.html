<a href="../images/50.6.8.gif">See diagram 50.6.8</a>: The four kinds of feather<br>
 Teach the children to study and describe feathers.<br>
 1.1 State what feathers feel like to touch.<br>
 1.2 Compare feathers as for size, colour, feel and shape.<br>
 1.3 Describe feathers as seen under a magnifying glass.<br>
 1.4 Compare the speed at which feathers float down when thrown into the 
air.<br>
 Use a collection of feathers:<br> 
 1.1 Flying feathers are used for flying and are found on the tail and wings.<br>
 1.2 Contour feathers are used to keep the bird warm and cover its whole
 body.<br>
 1.3 Down feathers grow beneath the flying and contour feathers.<br>
 It is soft and fluffy.<br>
 1.4 Pin feathers are long and thin and seen only in a plucked bird.<br>
 A cover of feathers in birds is like your hair.<br>
 It helps to trap layers of warm air for insulation.<br>
 In this way the heat in the body is kept in and not lost.<br>
 1. Give each group a set of feathers.<br>
 2. Feel the feathers with your fingers.<br>
 Do you feel the same? [No, some are softer than others.]<br>
 Find the biggest feather in your set and compare it with those from other crops. [Hold the feathers up for the children to see.]<br>
 Find the smallest feather in your set and compare it with those from other 
groups. Hold the feathers up for the children to see.]<br>
 Find the fluffiest, softest feather in the set and compare it with those
 from other groups.<br>
 3. Use the magnifying glass to see how the feather is made.<br>
 Tell your friends what you see.<br>
 4. Throw the feathers up in the air and see how you float down.<br>
 Which feather touched the ground first?<br>
 Which feather was last?<br>
 Why did they not reach the ground at the same time? [The fluffier feathers
 have a greater surface and so the air prevents them more<br>
 from falling quickly.<br>
 Remember that two objects with the same shape and volume, but different
 weights fall to earth with the same acceleration.<br>
 If they are released at the time, they will hit the ground simultaneously.]<br>
 Choose the lightest feather and try to keep it in the air by blowing.<br>
 5. Find coloured, straight and curved feathers, and put them into different
 groups.<br>
 6. Choose a feather from each set and tell the children to name the bird 
you think it comes from.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="2.2H">2.2</a> Bird sounds<br>
 Teach the children to describe the sounds made by different birds.<br>
 Before the lesson children can probably imitate the sounds of one bird, 
 e.g. cuckoo "sea to sea".<br>
 For the next lesson, tell the children to find some bird nests, but not
 to harm them.<br>
 1. Name a noisy bird and a quiet bird.<br>
 2. Name birds that keep together in flocks, and birds that do not keep
 together.<br>
 3. Imitate the sound of a bird.<br>
 4. Bird Sound Game<br>
 Divide the class into two groups, A. and B.<br>
 Let a child in Group A. imitate the sound of a bird and a child in Group
 B has to say the name of that bird.<br>
 Then let a child in Group B imitate the sound of a bird and a child in Group
a say the name of the bird.<br>
 Which group can guess the most names of birds correctly?<br>
 5. Try to call birds when you are at home.<br>
 If you hear the call of a bird, try to imitate it.<br>
 Sometimes the bird will call back thinking it is hearing another bird.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="2.3H">2.3</a>Bird beaks and feet<br>

sea".<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="2.4H">2.4</a> Different birds<br>
<a href="../images/9.1.2.gif">See diagram 9.1.2</a>: Birds 1<br>
<a href="../images/9.1.3.gif">See diagram 9.1.3</a>: Birds 2<br>
 Teach the children to describe different birds and draw them.<br>
 Get birds for children to observe during the lesson either by leaving some
food for them or by using caged birds.<br>
 Look at the drawings of birds in the diagram.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="2.5H">2.5</a> Protect birds<br>
<a href="../images/9.1.5.gif">See diagram 9.1.5</a>: Nesting houses, bird feeders<br>
 Teach the children to explain why they should protect birds, because they 
are part of your natural heritage.<br>
 Some birds are pests, because they eat crops, but they should not be killed, because they are part of the food web.<br>
 However, many kinds of birds are in danger of all being killed, because 
the human population is increasing.<br>
 Check the birds near the school.<br>
 1. Describe the birds near the school.<br>
 Can you imitate the voice of those birds?<br>
 Are birds friends or enemies?<br>
 They are friends, because they eat lots of insects that damage food crops.<br>
 Birds they are pleasant to look at and hear.<br>
 Birds can provide food for us.<br>
 Birds are part of the natural food web of all the different plants and
 animals in the country.<br>
 2. How can they protect birds?<br>
 Children can tell people that birds are important animals and should not 
be killed with shotguns<br>
 Children can tell people not to eat birds or their eggs unless very hungry<br>
 Children can tell people not to destroy their nests.<br>
 3. Display of drawings, birds near your school.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="2.6H">2.6</a> Care for birds<br>
<a href="../images/9.1.4.gif">See diagram 9.1.4</a>: Parrots<br>
 Teach the children to care for a pet bird.<br>
 Use a pet bird in the class, e.g. a parrot.<br>
 There are other kinds of parrots that can be tamed as pets such as the
 lory, lorikeet, cockatoo, and the pygmy parrot.<br>
 Some people keep pigeons.<br>
 The Eclectics parrot is found in coastal forests.<br>
 When flying it makes a horrible "kraal" noise, but when feeding it says
 "chew".<br>
 The female has brighter colours than the male.<br>
 This is unusual in birds.<br>
 The female is mainly red and blue with a black beak.<br>
 She has blue around her eyes.<br>
 The male is mainly green with a yellow beak.<br>
 Parrots can be tamed if you talk to them a lot and do not shout loudly.<br>
 They can be tethered to a tree or put in a very large cage with plenty 
of freedom.<br>
 They like to walk on the ground besides sitting on a perch.<br>
 They should be fed with fruit, nuts, grass and shell grit.<br>
 They need lots of clean water.<br>
 They like to move out of the sunlight when it is hot.<br>
 Parrots are funny friends if you care for them.<br>
 They can learn to talk.<br>
 1. Show the tame bird.<br>
 Do you have a tame bird at home?<br>
 2. Can you describe the colours of the bird?<br>
 Can you describe the song of the bird?<br>
 3. Can you look after a tame bird?<br>

<a href="../images/26.3.1.6.gif">See diagram 26.3.1.6</a>: Bottle sounds<br>
 Teach the children to make different sounds using bottles.<br>
 Use to collect 8-10 bottles the same size.<br>
 Practice putting water in them and hitting them with a coin to make sounds.<br>
 1. Sounds can be made with bottles.<br>
 Show how to blow across the top to make a sound.<br>
 Hitting an empty bottle can make a sound.<br>
 2. Pour some water in the bottle then hit it, pour more water in and hit 
it again.<br>
 What is the difference in the sounds? [The sounds are higher or lower.]<br>
 3. Pour different amounts of water in each bottle to try to make the sounds 
(pitch) of an octave.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="2.8H">2.8</a> Dull and bright<br>
<a href="../images/23.36.gif">See diagram: 4.36</a>: Dull and bright drink cans<br>
 Dull, dark coloured things absorb most of the heat reaching them, while
 the shiny light coloured things reflect most of the heat.<br>
 Light coloured things reflect most of the heat.<br>
 When an object absorbs heat, it gets hotter.<br>
 Consequently, dark coloured or black objects get hot much faster than white
or shiny things.<br>
 So light coloured clothes, houses, cars, are cooler in hot sunny places.<br>
 Divide the children into groups.<br>
 For each group you need :<br> 
 1. One clean and shiny one drink can and one drink can painted black.<br>
 2. One piece of dark-coloured cloth and one piece of white cloth or aluminium 
foil.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Teach the children to describe the effect of dull
 and bright surfaces in sunlight.<br>
 1. Give each group one clean and shiny one drink can and one drink can
 painted black.<br>
 Take the children outside and tell them to hold one of the drink cans in
each hand.<br>
 Note what happens after a few minutes? [The hand holding the black drink
 can feels hotter.]<br>
 2. Give each group one piece of dark-coloured cloth and one piece of white 
cloth or aluminium foil.<br>
 Put the dark-coloured cloth over one hand and the white cloth or aluminium
 foil over the other hand.<br>
 Note what happens after a few minutes. [The hand covered by the dark cloth 
is hotter than the hand covered by the white cloth, or<br>
 aluminium foil.]<br>
 4. Fill each of the drink cans with water and leave them in the sun for 
as long as possible.<br>
 Feel the water in each drink can after thirty minutes.<br>
 Note what you feel.<br>
 [The water in the black drink can is hotter than the water in the drink
 can tin.]<br>
 5. If you have a pair of very old shoes, paint the left shoe white and
 paint the right shoe black.<br>
 Stand in the sun.<br>
 Your right foot becomes your hot foot.<br>

 (by Christine Preston, University of Sydney, edited for this website)<br>
<a href="../images/2.46.gif">See diagram 2.46</a>: Simple wind detector<br>
 Teach children to make a wind detector and uses it to find the direction
 and strength of the wind.<br>
 1. Use a fan or hair dryer to blow some leaves around the floor.<br>
 What made the leaves move in the classroom?<br>
 Do leaves move in the same way in the school yard?<br>
 What makes leaves move in the school yard?<br>
 Does the wind always blow?<br>
 Is the wind always the same strength?<br>
 How can we tell if there is a wind?<br>
 Does the wind always come from the same direction?<br>
 What is wind?<br>
 2. We will make wind detectors to find the strength and direction of the 
wind.<br>
 Use scissors to cut cardboard in the shape of the wind detector in the
 diagram.<br>
 Insert the scissors into the cut made by the teacher and cut a hand hold.<br>
 Show the children how their hand fits into the hand hold.<br>
 Does the wind detector need anything else? [It needs streamers.]<br>
 Add streamers to the end, opposite the hand hold, and secure them with 
adhesive tape.]<br>
 3. Hold up your completed wind detectors in the classroom where there is
no wind.<br>
 The wind is calm.<br>
 What do you notice about the streamers? [None of the streamers are lifted
 by the wind.]<br>
 Tell the children to draw streamers when the wind is calm.<br>
 4. Hold the wind detectors in front of a fan or hair dryer on low speed. 
 The wind is a light wind.<br>
 What do you notice about the streamers? [In a light wind not all of the 
streamers are lifted by the wind.]<br>
 Tell the children to draw the streamers when there is a light wind.<br>
 5. Hold the wind detectors in front of a fan or hair dryer on high speed.
 The wind is a strong wind.<br>
 What do you notice about the streamers? [In a strong wind all of the streamers 
are being pushed out by wind.]<br>
 Tell the children draw the streamers when there is a strong wind.<br>
 6. Take the wind detectors outside to see if there is any wind and where
 it is coming from.<br>
 What will happen to the streamers on the wind detector if there is a calm 
wind, light wind, strong wind?<br>
 7. Winds may blow at different strengths.<br>
 Scientists have developed instruments, like our wind detectors, to measure
 and record strength and direction of the wind.<br>
 8. What happens to smoke from a chimney, in a calm wind, light wind, strong 
wind?<br>
 9. Windy poem<br>
 "Who has seen the wind?<br>
 Neither you nor I<br>
 But when the leaves are rustling,<br> 
 the wind is passing by."<br>

<a href="../images/29.2.3.2.gif">See diagram 29.2.3.2</a>: Pin chain<br>
 Use magnetic things and not- magnetic things.<br>
 Magnetic things are made of iron, e.g. pins, paper clips, staples, nails, 
 screws<br>
 Some black sand on the beach is magnetic.<br>
 Non-magnetic things are made of wood, plastic, chalk, clay, e.g. stones, 
 paper, wood, rubbers, pencils, chalk, teacup.<br>
 Use one magnet for each group.<br>
 Teach the children to use a magnet to find which things are attracted by
a magnet and are not attracted by a magnet,<br> 
 1. Give each group a magnet.<br>
 Look after the magnet carefully and do not drop it.<br>
 Give the children a magnet and tell them to pass it around the class.<br>
 2. Give each group a mixture of some magnetic things and some things that 
are not magnetic.<br>
 Which things can the magnet pick up? [Pins, paper clips, nails.<br>
 Which things can the magnet not pick up? [Chalk, plastic, paper.]<br>
 3. Give each group lots of pins or paper clips or very small nails.<br>
 Tell the children: what happens when you put the magnet near all the pins? 
[The magnet pulls all the pins towards it.]<br>
 4. Pull all the pins off the magnet.<br>
 Then tell the children to pick up the magnet and put one pin on the end 
of it.<br>
 Then put another pin on the first and then more pins to make it a chain
 of pins.<br>
 Now tell the children to hold the first pin and take away the magnet.<br>
 Do the pins remain together in a chain? [Yes.]<br>
 Who can make the longest chain of pins?<br>
 5. Dancing pins.<br>
 Put some pins on a piece of paper or glass or a plate.<br>
 Move the magnet under the paper and the pins will dance.<br>
 Why does the magnet make the pins dance?<br>
 6. Tie a piece of string around the middle of two magnets.<br>
 Hold each magnet up by its string, then bring them together.<br>
 Can you get the end of the magnets to touch each other? [No.]<br>

 1. Cut out the shape over the page using the stiff cardboard.<br>
 Let the parrot hang on a stick.<br>
 Push its tail.<br>
 Does it fall over? [No, it balances.]<br>
 2. Balancing bird<br>
 Make a bird perch on your finger.<br>
 Use the diagram of a bird on this page as a template to draw a bird on cardboard.<br>
 Cut out the bird.<br>
 Try balancing the bird so that it will perch on your finger.<br>
 If not, attach some Plasticine on the lowest point of the bird's tail.<br>
 Does the bird balance on your finger now?<br>
 How much plasticine do you need on the tail for the bird just to balance?<br>

 | <a href="../images/12.4.1.gif">See diagram 12.4.1</a>: Siphon fountain<br>
 Teach the children to make a water spray and transfer liquids using a siphon.<br>
 1. Use a siphon.<br>
 Put a rubber tube under water until it is completely filled with water
 so no air remains in the tube.<br>
 Close each end of the tube with a finger and lift the tube full of water
 out of the container.<br>
 Hold one closed end in an upper jar full of water.<br>
 Remove the fingers from the ends of the rubber tube.<br>
 Water will siphon up into the rubber tube then down into the lower empty
 jar.<br>
 1. Push the water jet into one end of the rubber tube.<br>
 Force the other end of the rubber tube through the nail hole in the bottom 
of the milk tin.<br>
 Hold the equipment upright in a U-shape and place a finger over the water 
jet.<br>
 Tell one the children to fill the milk tin with water.<br>
 Take your finger off the water jet.<br>
 What do you see? [Water shoots out like a fountain.]<br>
 2. Lower the jet and asks what happens? [The water spurts higher.]<br>
 Raise the jet and asks what happens? [The fountain is smaller.]<br>
 Repeat raising and lowering the jet slowly so that the children can see 
it clearly what happens to the water.<br>
 [The fountain gets bigger and smaller.]<br>
 Refill the tin with water as needed.<br>
 3. If you can tell you how to stop the fountain working without closing 
 it with a finger? [Raise the jet above the height of the tin.]<br>
 Let groups of children play the water fountain.<br>
 4. Take two jars.<br>
 Put one on the table and the other on a chair next to the table so that
 the second jar is lower than the first.<br>
 Fill the jar on the table about three quarters full of water.<br>
 You have to transfer the water from the top jar to the lower jar without
 moving or tipping the top jar.<br>
 Show a piece of rubber tubing.<br>
 Who can use the siphon tube to transfer the water? Show the siphon to the 
class.<br>
 Take turns at filling the tube and letting water flow from the top jar
 to the bottom jar using the siphon.<br>
 5. What are the uses of siphons? [Siphons are used to empty the dirty water
from an aquarium or fish tank, to "suck out' petrol from<br>
 a petrol tank, to transfer blood from a bottle into the arm of a patient.]<br>

<a href="../images/1.13.gif">See diagram 1.13</a>: Smelling a gas<br>
 The safe way to smell something is to fan the gas towards the nose with
 the hand and sniff cautiously.<br>
 If you detect no odour, move closer and try again<br>
 Use to collect different substances that have different kinds of smell.<br>
 Warning: Do not let children smell petrol, methylated spirit, alcohol, 
pesticides, correcting fluid and dry cleaning fluid.<br>
 Kinds of smells:<br> 
 1.1 "Fruity", from ripe fruit,<br> 
 1.2 "Fragrant", from flowers and perfume,<br> 
 1.3 "Onion", from onion, garlic, sulfur,<br> 
 1.4 "Burning", from burning meat, coffee, feathers,<br> 
 1.5 "Sweaty", from sweat, old cheese, goats,<br> 
 1.6 "Foul", from rotten meat, rotten vegetables and faeces.<br>
 Teach the children to use the sense of smell to distinguish between different 
substances.<br>
 1. What do you use to describe things? [The five senses: sight, sound, 
 hearing, touch, taste and smell.]<br>
 2. Name some good smells and bad smells.<br>
 3. Pass around examples of different smells, e.g. ripe bananas, fragrant
 flowers, cut onion, burnt feather, old shirt, damp earth.<br>
 Describe the smells.<br>
 4. Smelling game<br>
 Give out the examples to the groups.<br>
 Each child shuts its eyes, is given something to smell and then must say 
what it is.<br>
 The child with the most correct answers wins.<br>
 5. Show how animals smell things.<br>
 Which animals smell things a lot? [Dogs and cats.]<br>
 Which animals do not smell things much? [Birds.]<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="2.19H">2.19</a> Our skin and hair<br>
 Teach the children to describe your skin and hair.<br>
 Use magnifying glasses, ink, pencils, white paper.<br>
 1. Give each group a magnifying glass and white paper.<br>
 2. Look carefully at your bodies and name places where hair grows? [Head, 
 arms, legs.]<br>
 Does hair grow on the palms of the hands? [No.]<br>
 Does hair grow on the bottom of the feet? [No.]<br>
 Look at the hair on the head of the person next to you.<br>
 What colour is your friend's hair?<br>
 Is your friend's hair fuzzy, curly or straight?<br>
 Find the longest hair in your friend's head.<br>
 3. Take turns using a magnifying glass to look at the hairs on your arms 
and the hairs on your friend's arms.<br>
 Carefully pull out a hair from your head with a quick pull and put it on 
the sheet of white paper.<br>
 Draw one hair including the tip of the hair and the root.<br>
 4. Look at the skin with the magnifying glass: on the back of the hand, 
 on the palm of the hand.<br>
 Can you see where the hairs come out of little holes called pores of the 
skin?<br>
 Put ink or pencil on the skin.<br>
 Can you see the pattern of the skin?<br>
 Draw the pattern of the skin.<br>
 5. Look at the skin of your thumb with the magnifying glass.<br>
 Can you see a pattern? Put a small drop of ink on paper or cloth.<br>
 Press the thumbs down on it, then press the thumb on clean paper.<br>
 Can you see the pattern of the skin?<br>
 This is called a fingerprint.<br>
 It is used by policemen to discover who stole something by comparing fingerprints.<br>
 6. The thickness of hair is not affected by shaving or cutting.<br>
 So cut hair does not grow thicker, healthy food makes hair grow thicker.<br>
 7. If a grey hair is pulled out two more grey hairs will not grow.<br>
 However, repeated pulling out of grey hairs may damage the hair follicle.<br>

<a href="../images/23.24.gif">See diagram 23.24</a>: Charcoal burner<br>
 When you light a candle you first heat some of the wick, which burns to 
produce heat.<br>
 This heat melts solid wax to become a liquid, then a gas. This gas burns
 to form the candle flame and produce heat.<br>
 Study changes caused by heating<br>
 1. Collect different solids, e.g. stone, grass, metal foil, bone, wood, 
 clay, plastic, paper, iron, wool,<br> 
 2. Hold each solid with tongs and heat it over a spirit burner.<br>
 3. Observe carefully what happens to each substance.<br>
 Does the substance change?<br>
 How does it change?<br>
 Does it burn?<br>
 If it burns is anything left when it stops burning?<br>
 4. Collect the following substances: flour, sugar and wax.<br>
 5. Heat each of these substances in turn in a spoon, or on a tin lid, held
over the spirit burner.<br>
 6. Observe carefully what happens to each substance.<br>
 Does the substance change?<br>
 How does it change?<br>
 Does it burn?<br>
 If it burns is anything left when it stops burning?<br>
 7. Do all substances change the same way when they are heated?<br>
 Which substances change when they are hot, but go back to their original
 form when they cool again?<br>
 Which substances change permanently?<br>
 Some of the metals you find are mixtures.<br>
 Solder metal is used to join metals together.<br>
 It melts at low temperatures.<br>
 Solder is a mixture of lead and tin.<br>
 Brass is a hard yellow metal used to make taps.<br>
 Brass is a mixture of copper and zinc.<br>
 Steel is mainly iron with some carbon.<br>
 Steel is very springy and strong and is used to make razor blades.<br>
 Coin coins are made of a mixture of copper and nickel.<br>
 Studying corrosion<br>
 Collect some old bits of metal.<br>
 Look at them carefully.<br>
 Some of the pieces will no longer be shiny.<br>
 Many metals go dull when they are old and left lying about.<br>
 Lead becomes covered with a dark grey substance.<br>
 Iron gets covered with a brown substance called rust.<br>
 The outside of the lead and the iron changes.<br>
 You say it corrodes.<br>
 Corrosion destroys metals.<br>
 The commonest form of corrosion is the rusting of iron.<br>

 1. To show and apply the balance condition of lever, use a strong board
 about 3 m long and a saw horse or use a playground see-saw.<br>
 Select two students of similar weight.<br>
 Tell them to sit at either end of the board so that they balance and the 
see-saw is horizontal.<br>
 Measure the distance from the balance point to each student.<br>
 Observe that they are similar distances from the fulcrum.<br>
 For each student multiply the distance by the student's weight and compare
 the moments, they should be equal.<br>
 2. Select a heavier student and a lighter student and repeat Part 1.<br>
 3. Select a heavier student and two lighter students.<br>
 Tell them to sit on the board so that they balance.<br>
 The two lighter students may not necessarily have to sit together.<br>
 Measure the distance from the balance point to each student.<br>
 Multiply the distance by the student's weight.<br>
 Add the moments for the two lighter students and compare it to the moment
 produced by the heavier student.<br>

 Teach the children to make a simple beam balance and use it to weigh things.<br>
 Use three pieces of string each about 35 cm long, a wooden ruler that you
can cut, or a smooth stick, two match boxes, a knife.<br>
 Cut a small V-shape in each side of the ruler or stick.<br>
 Tie one end of a piece of string around where the V's are.<br>
 Hold up the ruler by the other end of the string and it should balance
 horizontally.<br>
 Make four holes in the corners of two matchbox trays.<br>
 Thread one end of the string through the holes as shown, then tie the two
ends.<br>
 Pull the string so that the knot is at the top.<br>
 Use some chalk and little stones.<br>
 Move the matchbox trays on the ruler until it balances horizontally.<br>
 Notice the positions on the ruler.<br>
 1. Show how you tie the string to the ruler and then show it balancing 
horizontally.<br>
 2. Show how you made the matchbox trays.<br>
 Show them balancing horizontally from the ruler.<br>
 3. Place a large piece of chalk on the left hand tray, it goes down.<br>
 Put little stones in the right hand tray until the ruler is horizontal
 again.<br>
 The weight of the chalk is now equal to the weight of the stones.<br>

 Place each kind of flower in separate piles.<br>
 2. Hold up each kind of flower.<br>
 What colour it is?<br>
 3. Explain where you found it.<br>
 4. Show the petals on the flowers.<br>
 How many petals can you see on each kind of flower?<br>
 [Dicotyledons, e.g. trees, shrubs and herbs have 5 or 10 or 15, 5 x, or 
many petals]<br>
 [Monocotyledons, e.g. grass, lilies, maize, have 3 or 6 or 9 or 3 x, 
 or many petals.]<br>
 5. Can see other parts of flowers that are in 5's or 3's? [Sepals, male
 parts, female parts.]<br>
 6. Flowers attract bees and birds, because flowers contain nectar, i.e. 
honey.<br>
 Put your little finger into the flower and try to find some nectar, just 
like a bee or a bird.<br>
 Does nectar taste sweet? [Yes.]<br>
 Put your little finger into a flower and try to find the nectar.<br>
 7. Put the flowers into two different groups:<br> 
 big / small,<br> 
 colourful / not colourful,<br> 
 parts in 5's / parts in 3's,<br> 
 have nectar / no nectar,<br> 
 red / not red,<br> 
 many flowers on a branch / one flower on a branch.<br>
 8. Draw the flowers you have collected.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="2.32H">2.32</a> Collect seeds<br>
 Teach the children to recognize the difference between different seeds.<br>
 Make a collection of 4-5 different kinds of seeds, e.g. peanuts, other
 legumes, corn, pumpkin, melon, tomato, pandanus, papaya.<br>
 Use 12 seeds of each kind and a clock face.<br>
 1. Divide the children into groups so that each group has 12 seeds of one 
kind,<br> 
 e.g. Group A: 12 pumpkin seeds, Group B: 12 peanut seeds, Group C: 12 papaya 
seeds.<br>
 2. Are all the seeds the same size? [No.]<br>
 Put the seeds in one line, biggest to smallest, then count the seeds? [12.]<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="2.33H">2.33</a> Floating and sinking<br>
 Teach the children to observe things which float and things which sink.<br>
 Collect wood, ball, bottle tops, stones and other objects.<br>
 Use also plasticine (modelling clay) or putty, jars, water, bottle, little 
stones, container with water.<br>
 Grouping in pairs<br>
 1. Let the children make things float.<br>
 Are they all the same depth in the water? [No Give each group a bottle 
or show the children how to make a paper boat.<br>
 Add little stones to the floating bottle or paper boat.<br>
 Do you stay the same depth in the water? [No, you get deeper until you
 sink.<br>
 Give the children things which sink including a lump of plasticine what
 happens when things sink? [the water level in the container rises.<br>
 2. Make a canoe out of the plasticine.<br>
 If the walls are very thin it will float.<br>
 What is the difference between the plasticine sinking and floating? [When 
it floats the water level in the container is higher, the volume is bigger.<br>
 3. What other things can be made to sink or float? (galvanized iron canoe, 
iron boat.]<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="2.34H">2.34</a> Different kinds of food<br>
 Teach the children to identify the three different kinds of food when shown
samples.<br>
 Collect samples of:<br> 
 1.1 potato, sweet potato, rice,<br> 
 1.2. meat, fish, beans,<br> 
 1.3. vegetable oil or peanut butter, fruit, edible greens,<br> 
 1.4. salt, milk.<br>
 1. Show the different samples of food.<br>
 2. Potato, sweet potato or rice.<br>
 Taste them raw.<br>
 You can taste starch.<br>
 If you eat plenty of these foods, you will not get tired easily.<br>
 These are energy foods.<br>
 3. Meat, fish and beans.<br>
 These foods will make children grow big and strong.<br>
 These are growth foods.<br>
 4. Vegetable oil, peanut butter, edible greens.<br>
 These are protective foods.<br>
 Protective foods keep you healthy and protect you from sickness.<br>
 5. Salt is needed in small amounts.<br>
 Milk is needed, because it contains calcium to make strong bones.<br>
 Salt and calcium are called minerals.<br>
 6. Each day eat the three kinds of food:<br> 
 6.1 Energy food,<br> 
 6.2 Growth food,<br> 
 6.3 Protective food,<br> 
 6.4 Milk and salt.<br>
 What are the different foods you eat each day at home?<br>
 7. Contact a health worker to talk about healthy diet for children.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="2.35H">2.35</a> Paint with plant juices<br>
 Teach the children to use juices from leaves and flowers to draw things.<br>
 Use some plants that produce colourful juice when you break the stem.<br>
 Before the lesson, check which plants grow in the school grounds that the
children can pick or they must bring to the class.<br>
 1. Show how to break stems and squeeze leaves and flowers to make plant
 juices of different colours.<br>
 2. Draw circles with each kind of leaf and flower juice.<br>
 How many different coloured circles can you draw?<br>
 Can you write their name in plant juices?<br>
 3. Can you draw a flower using plant juice?<br>
 4. Hang up all the drawings on the wall.<br>
 Look at them the next day, are the colours the same?<br>
 5. Competition for the best drawing using plant juices.<br>
 6. Try to draw yourselves using the plant juices.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="2.36H">2.36</a> Examine rocks with a magnifier<br>
 Teach the children to describe what you can see inside a rock.<br>
 The most common kinds of rocks are as follows:<br> 
 1.1 Reef limestone is found near the coast, because they are formed from
 old coral reefs.<br>
 They have a white grey, stony appearance.<br>
 You cannot see crystals and it cannot be split into layers.<br>
 It fizzes if put in acid.<br>
 1.2 Sedimentary rocks are formed from mud, sand and little stones compressed
 together.<br>
 Sometimes you can see crystals and layers.<br>
 1.3 Volcanic rocks formed when the lava from old volcanoes has cooled.<br>
 1.4 Basalt is a dark coloured rock with fine crystals.<br>
 Sometimes it contains little holes, but it is never in layers.<br>
 1.5 Andesite is light coloured with very tiny crystals although there may
be some scattered large crystals in it.<br>
 Do not tell the children the names of the rocks.<br>
 Use magnifying glasses and a collection of different kinds of rocks.<br>
 Put the rocks in a cloth bag and hit them with a hammer to get clean faces.<br>
 1. Give out the magnifying glasses and your rock collection to each group.<br>
 2. Look carefully inside a piece of rock.<br>
 What do you see inside?<br>
 Is it all the same inside or is it different?<br>
 Can you see the layers?<br>
 Can you see shiny crystals?<br>
 What colour is the rock?<br>
 Can you see holes?<br>
 3. Take another piece of rock and describe it.<br>
 4. Look at both pieces of rock.<br>
 What are the differences between them?<br>
 Divide all your rocks into 3-4 piles.<br>
 The rocks in each pile should have the same description, e.g. all white
 all layers, all have shiny crystals.<br>
 5. Make a display of different kinds of rocks based on what you saw inside 
them.<br>
 Stick the rocks on cardboard and hang this in the wall.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="2.37H">2.37</a> Different soils<br>
 <a href="../images/6.26.gif">See diagram 6.26</a>: Soil profiles<br>
 Teach the children to collect different soil samples and state three ways 
in which the samples are different.<br>
 Use many sheets of old paper to wrap small samples of soil in, digging 
tools (spades) or digging sticks, 10 sheets of stiff paper or<br>
 cardboard, glue or paste, ready mixed.<br>
 Be sure you can get three very different kinds of soil, e.g. garden soil, 
forest soils, soil from a bare area or near a beach.<br>
 Soils can be different from each other in several ways, e.g. colour, textures 
(or "feel"), amount of black sticky humus, amount of<br>
 decaying plant and animal matter present, how the soil holds together, 
 and the size of the particles.<br>
 There are three main types of soils are:<br> 
 1. Sandy soil<br>
 Sandy soils are usually loose and free flowing with large particles and 
a rough texture.<br>
 2. Clay soil<br>
 Clay soils are smooth and sticky with very small particles.<br>
 3. Loam or garden soil.<br>
 Garden soils have plenty of humus and have a mixture of small and large 
 particles.<br>
 Before the lesson try to find places around the school where these different
 types of soils can be found.<br>
 You can then direct the children to these areas when you are collecting.<br>
 1. Give out the prepared materials, give out soils, or tell the children
 to go outside and collect soil samples.<br>
 2. Look at the colour of the soil, to feel it, to see what is in it, how 
well it holds together, to wrap small samples of soil in separate<br>
 pieces of paper, to write on each parcel where the soil came from.<br>
 3. After 15 minutes of collecting bring the children back into the classroom
 and quickly find out which group has collected which soils.<br>
 You are going to display your soils for other classes to see.<br>
 4. To display the soil samples, use a glue brush to make a 2 cm strip of
glue on a piece of cardboard.<br>
 Sprinkle the soil sample on the strip of glue.<br>
 Write the name of the place where the soil came from on the cardboard.<br>
 5. Name three ways in which soils can be different? [Colour, "feel", size 
of particles, amount of plants / animals present.<br>
 What different types of soils did your group collect? [Different answers
 from different groups.]<br>
 Describe each soil.<br>
 Which group collected the most different soil samples? [Name the group.]<br>
 6. Bring to the class different soil samples from near your home to add 
them to the display.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="2.38H">2.38</a> Shake soil in water<br>
 Teach the children to separate soil into different components and discover
 how soil is formed.<br>
 Use some topsoil taken from underneath some old leaves, glass jars, water.<br>
 1. Take the children outside to dig up some soil just underneath some old
leaves.<br>
 2. Feel the soil by rubbing it between the thumb and finger.<br>
 What do you feel? [Most of the soil feels gritty, but the black part of the
soil feels sticky.]<br>
 3. Add soil to the jar containing water then shake the jar.<br>
 Put the jar on the table and leave it to let the soil settle down.<br>
 4. What do you see? [4.1 Some bits of plant are floating.]<br>
 [4.2 Bigger stones fall down first, then the large sand particles, then
 the small sand particles.]<br>
 [4.3 The water remains muddy for a time, because of the smallest particles
 do not fall down.]<br>
 [4.4 After a long time all the smallest particles and a thin layer of black 
stuff fall down and the water becomes clear.]<br>
 [4.5 If you bump or shake the jar the water becomes muddy again.]<br>
 5. Point to the different layers in the water: stones, big particles of 
sand, small particles of sand, mud, floating parts of plants.<br>
 Where do the layers come from? [The layers that feel gritty come from broken
rocks.<br>
 The black stuff that feels sticky and the floating stuff comes from plants 
and animals.]<br>
 6. Rocks can be broken into small particles by the weather and rivers but
it takes many years.<br>
 The dead bodies of plants and animals form the black sticky stuff after
 some years.<br>
 Soil takes a long time to form so you must not let it get washed away.<br>
 7. Good soil contains different sizes of stone particles and the black
 sticky stuff.<br>
 Bad soil contains stone particles only.<br>
 Where do you find good soil and bad soil in the school grounds? [Good soil
is found in places where you find lots of old dead leaves.]<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="2.39H">2.39</a> Water through soil<br>
<a href="../images/35.6.3.gif">See diagram 36.6.3</a>: Water through soil<br>
 Teach the children to observe how much water passes through different kinds
of soils.<br>
 Use tins with holes punched in the bottom, sandy soil, good soil, clay
 soil, two glass jars.<br>
 1. Give out to each group: one tin with holes, sandy soil, good soil, clay
soil, two glass jars.<br>
 2. Show how to fill the tin with soil, then tip in the first jar of water.<br>
 The second jar is used to catch the water passing through. Do this with
 three different soils.<br>
 3. Through which soil does the water pass fastest? [Sandy soil.]<br>
 Through which soil does the water pass the slowest? [Clay soil. The water 
may not pass through the clay at all.]<br>
 4. Use your fingers to measure the depth of water in the first jar before
 pouring it through the good soil.<br>
 After five minutes, pour the water in the second jar back into the first
 jar.<br>
 How much water remains in the first jar?<br>
 5. Repeat 4, but leave it to drain for a whole day.<br>
 How much water is held in the soil after one day?<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="2.40H">2.40</a> Soil settles in water.<br>
 Use samples of sand, garden soil and powdered clay (for each group, glass 
jars, 10 containers of water.<br>
 1. Put a small amount of clay in a glass jar.<br>
 Almost fill the jar with water.<br>
 Stir the mixture.<br>
 Hold the jar up to the light.<br>
 Look carefully at the mixture.<br>
 What do you see? [The clay does not settle in the water.]<br>
 Place the jar on a piece of paper and write the word CLAY on the paper.<br>
 Do not empty the jar.<br>
 2. Repeat step one for both sand and garden soil.<br>
 In each case tell the children what happens? [Sand settles quickly and
 soil separates into different parts.]<br>
 Place each jar on a piece of paper and label them "sand" and "garden soil".<br>
 3. Place the three jars on your labels in a safe place where they will
 not be moved and allow them to stand for a day and night.<br>
 4. Show a jar of muddy water from a river and a jar fill of clean water.<br>
 How can you make the clean water look like the river water? [Add clay or
soil to the water.]<br>
 5. How did the river water become muddy? [Sand settles much faster than
 clay, because the particles are much bigger and heavier.<br>
 When sand and clay are washed into a river, the sand settles, but the clay 
cannot settle, because the water is moving.<br>
 So the river looks muddy if there is lots of clay in it.]<br>
 6. Collect samples of muddy water from rivers and pools.<br>
 Put them in jars and see how long they take to settle.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="2.41H">2.41</a> Shake good soil and bad soil in water<br>
 Teach the children to explain what they see when good soil and bad soil
 are shaken in water and left to settle.<br>
 Use some good soil and bad soil, jars with lids, a ruler.<br>
 The good soil can be topsoil from the garden especially if it is a new
 garden that has been recently cleared from the bush.<br>
 The bad soil could be subsoil or soil that is on a slope and partly washed 
away.<br>
 The good soil will have roughly equal amounts of sand and clay and much
 plant matter. The bad soil will have little plant matter in it.<br>
 Show the good soil and bad soil.<br>
 Give each group two jars.<br>
 Fill the jars with water, pour equal amounts of soil in, shake the jars
 and let them stand.<br>
 What do you see? [The soil falls down and the water stays muddy, plant
 matter floats on the water.]<br>
 After a few more minutes tell the children what you see.<br>
 [The muddy water is starting to clear.]<br>
 Show the layers of stones, clay and sand.<br>
 Where did the clay come from? [It was floating in the water before the
 water cleared.]<br>
 Measure the depth of the stones, sand, and clay with your finger or a ruler.<br>
 Describe the difference between what you see in the jar containing good
 soil and the jar containing bad soil.<br>
 [Good soil contains more black plant matter, surface soil will have little 
clay and the muddy water will clear first, bad subsoil may be<br>
 nearly all clay and the muddy water will clear last.]<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="2.43H">2.43</a> Different metals<br>
 Teach the children to collect different metals from the home and the school.<br>
 1. Identify metals<br>
 Iron is a shiny metal that goes rusty.<br>
 Nails, knives and tools are made of iron.<br>
 Most metal in a can is iron.<br>
 This metal, unlike most others, can be pulled by a magnet.<br>
 Lead is a soft metal, usually grey.<br>
 It looks like silver when it is scratched.<br>
 Found in old water pipes and old car batteries.<br>
 Aluminium is a shiny metal.<br>
 Used for making silver paper (foil).<br>
 Copper is a red brown metal.<br>
 It is quite soft and it is used to make electrical wire.<br>
 Zinc is a grey metal.<br>
 It is found in cells.<br>
 It is used to cover things made of iron, e.g. galvanized iron roofing and
fencing wire.<br>
 Chromium is a shiny metal, e.g. the shiny parts of a motor car.<br>
 These parts are usually made of steel, covered with a thin layer of chromium.<br>
 Tin is a shiny white metal.<br>
 It is used to cover cans made of iron.<br>
 2. Some of the metals you find are mixtures.<br>
 Solder metal is used to join metals together.<br>
 It melts at low temperatures.<br>
 Solder is a mixture of lead and tin.<br>
 Brass is a hard yellow metal used to make taps.<br>
 Brass is a mixture of copper and zinc.<br>
 Steel is mainly iron with some carbon.<br>
 Steel is very springy and strong and is used to make razor blades.<br>
 Coin are made of a mixture of copper and nickel.<br>
 3. Study corrosion<br>
 Collect some old bits of metal.<br>
 Look at them carefully.<br>
 Some of the pieces will no longer be shiny.<br>
 Many metals go dull when they are old and left lying about.<br>
 Lead becomes covered with a dark grey substance.<br>
 Iron gets covered with a brown substance called rust.<br>
 The outside of the lead and the iron changes.<br>
 You say it corrodes.<br>
 Corrosion destroys metals.<br>
 The commonest form of corrosion is the rusting of iron.<br>

 Teach the children to study a burning candle.<br>
 Fire can be useful.<br>
 It can also be dangerous.<br>
 Its heat can cook food.<br>
 Its heat can also burn you.<br>
 In this experiment you will study fire.<br>
 You must study it carefully and safely, or you could be burned and scarred.<br>
 Always obey these instructions: 1. Fires made from things that burn quickly, 
e.g. paper, must be made outside.<br>
 Keep away from dry grass.<br>
 2. Do not touch hot containers with your hands.<br>
 3. Keep a bucket of water and a bucket of dry sand near you to put out
 fires.<br>
 4. Avoid sudden movements.<br>
 5. If you burn yourself, cool the burnt part in the cold water.<br>
 Keep it cool for 10 minutes then get first aid from your teacher.<br>
 1. Stand a candle on a table so that it is not in a draught.<br>
 2. Light the candle.<br>
 Watch the flame carefully.<br>
 What shape is the flame?<br>
 Is the shape always the same?<br>
 What colours can you see in the flame?<br>
 Is the candle wick straight or bent?<br>
 3. Draw a picture of the flame and colour the picture.<br>
 4. What happens to the candle?<br>
 Does the candle get smaller?<br>
 What happens to the wax just below the flame?<br>
 Where does the melted wax go?<br>
 Graph showing length of candle as it burns, at different times of day: 
 | 8 a.m. | 10.0 a.m. | 12 noon | 2 p.m. | 4 p.m. |<br> 
 5. The graph shows how the length of a candle changed while it burned.<br>
 How much of this candle burned in each hour?<br>
 At what time do you think the candle would have completely burned away?<br>
 Could the candle be used as a clock?<br>
 6. Candle experiments<br>
 Use 2 candles and several jars of different sizes.<br>
 6.1 Put a large jar over a burning candle.<br>
 Did the candle continue burning? How long did it keep burning?<br>
 6.2 Place a smaller jar over a burning candle.<br>
 Did the candle continue burning? How long did it keep burning?<br>
 6.3 Light two candles.<br>
 Cover one candle with a jar.<br>
 When the flame goes out, remove the jar and place it immediately over the
second candle.<br>
 What do you observe?<br>
