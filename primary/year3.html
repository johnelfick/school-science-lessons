 Teach the children to describe the individual behaviour and social behaviour
 of an ant colony.<br>
 1. Use a large jar with tight screw top, a suitable ant's nest, magnifier. 
 Take the children to an ant nest.<br>
 Dig up some of it and put the ants in a glass jar with a tight screw top.<br>
 Put some leaves and bread in the jar.<br>
 Let the children watch the ants in the jar for a few hours each day.<br>
 What do the ants do? [Build their nest again.]<br>
 Catch some ants and put them in methylated spirit.<br>
 Let the children look at them with a magnifier.<br>
 2. Note how many parts of the body. [3.]<br>
 Note how many legs. [6.]<br>
 Where are the legs attached? [At the middle part.]<br>
 Draw an ant.<br>
 Label the parts.<br>
 Note how many eyes and antennas.<br>
 Are all the ants the same? Do any ants have wings?
Draw the different kinds of ants.<br>
 3. Identify the different stages in the life cycle of ants.<br>
 In this lesson teach the children to recognize the different stages in the ant life cycle by showing the children specimens from an ant's nest.<br>
 Use a suitable ant's nest, methylated spirit, small jars, magnifier.<br>
 Make sure that the ants will not bite the children.<br>
 You may need an ant sucker.<br>
 4. Open an ant's nest and collect the different stages of the life cycle.<br>
 Where are the workers? [Everywhere, usually outside looking for food.]<br>
 Where is the queen? [Find the queens deep inside the nest.]<br>
 Where are the egg, larvae (grubs) and pupae? [In different parts of the 
nest.]<br>
 Where are the males? [The males are hard to find, because they die after 
 the marriage flight.]<br>
 5. Draw some rooms and galleries of the nest.<br>
 Can you see workers carrying eggs to safety when you broke open the nest? 
 Take the specimens back to the classroom.<br>
 Let the children look at them with a magnifier.<br>
 Draw the ant life cycle on the chalkboard.<br>
 Ask the children why is it called a life cycle.<br>
 6. Make a collection of ants preserved in methylated spirits.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="3.2H">3.</a>02 Mosquito life cycle<br>
 | <a href="../images/9.8.0.gif">See diagram 9.8.0</a>: Life cycle of mosquito<br>
 Teach the children to identify the different stages in the life cycle of the mosquito.<br>
 Use class specimens, (live eggs, pupae, larvae and adults), jars and magnifiers.
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H">1. The children can recognize stages in the mosquito
 life cycle, because these insects can carry disease such as malaria fever, dengue fever, encephalitis, Ross River virus.<br>
 Mosquitoes may also carry heart worm that is fatal to cats and dogs.<br>
 Male adults have feathery antennae.<br>
 They do not bite people.<br>
 Female adults do bite people to get a drink of blood.<br>
 They live for about three weeks. 

<hr width="100%" size="2H">2. Show the children examples of eggs, pupa, larva
 and adult.<br>
 The eggs are laid on the water at night as single floating eggs or stuck 
 together to form rafts.<br>
 The larva is the stage when you can most easily control the mosquito, because 
it has to live in water for a long time.<br>
 The larva has a breathing tube, siphon that hangs down from the water surface, 
kept there by surface tension.<br>
 However, Anopheles has a short siphon so the larva hangs horizontally, 
parallel to the water surface.<br>
 Draining the water or adding insecticide to the water to kill the larvae 
 can control mosquitoes.<br>
 The pupa is unusual, because it can wriggle.<br>
 It does not feed and breathes air through two trumpet-shaped tubes.<br>
 The mosquito life cycle lasts about seven days. 
<hr width="100%" size="2H">3. Show the children diagrams of the <i>Anopheles</i>
 mosquito that carries malaria fever.<br>
 How can you can help to control mosquitoes near your home?<br>
 Remove water containers, e.g. buckets, discarded containers, roof gutters, 
 pot plant trays.<br>
 Cover entry spaces to rainwater tanks with fine wire mesh.<br>
 Put fish that eat mosquito larvae in ponds, e.g. <i>Gambusia</i> or a local
species if <i>Gambusia</i> is not allowed in your area.<br>
 If mosquitoes are common in your are do not go outdoor at dawn or dusk 
when mosquitoes are most active.<br>
 If you must go outside, wear a long-sleeved shirt, long pants and use an
insect repellent.<br>
 Encourage the children to collect stages of the life cycle of the mosquito 
 found near their homes. 
<hr width="100%" size="2H">4. Collect the different stages of the mosquito
 life cycle: eggs, pupae, larvae, male and female adults.<br>
 The eggs usually cluster together to form a raft.<br>
 The pupa is unusual, because it can wriggle.<br>
 Keep the different stages in a large screw top jar or an aquarium with 
a glass top.<br>
 Put water weed in the jar or aquarium.<br>
 Do not allow adult mosquitoes to fly out and bite people, because of the 
diseases carried by mosquitoes. 
<hr width="100%" size="2H">5. The mosquito can most easily be controlled during
 the larva stage when it lives in water for a long time.<br>
 Draining the water or adding insecticide to the water kill the larvae and
control mosquitoes. 
<hr width="100%" size="2H">6. Observe diagrams of the <i>Anopheles</i> mosquito
 that carries malaria fever caused by the parasitic protozoan <i>Plasmodium</i>.<br>
 Discuss how to control mosquitoes near the home. 
<hr width="100%" size="2H">7. The main sites for mosquito breeding are as
follows:<br>
 7.1 Salt marsh mosquitoes breed in low-lying land near the sea and in tidal
drains.<br>
 7.2 Freshwater mosquitoes breed in temporary ground pools, drains, swamps, 
 roadsides, parks, and reserves.<br>
 These breeding sites attract more mosquitoes than permanent pools or running 
water where fish may eat the mosquito larvae.<br>
 7.3 Container-breeding mosquitoes breed in "natural" breeding places, e.g. tree cavities that full with water after rain and hollows in bromeliad plants and palms.<br>
 They also breed in rubbish and discarded containers, e.g. pot plant saucers, plastic containers, bird baths, motor car tyres and water tanks. 
<hr width="100%" size="2H">8. The most important species in Australia are as follows: <br>
 <i>Culex annulirostris</i> is mainly in the south-east.<br>
 <i>Ochlerotatus (Aedes) vigilax</i>, the salt marsh mosquito, is mainly 
 in the northern coastal areas.<br>
 <i>Ochlerotatus (Aedes) camptorhynchus</i> is mainly in southern coastal 
 areas.<br>
 <i>Culex molestus</i> is in southern areas and it bites indoors at night.<br>
 <i>Aedes aegypti</i> is in northern Queensland.<br>
 Most Australian species may carry viruses, but <i>Aedes aegypti</i> may
 carry dengue fever, break bone fever.<br>
 The haemorrhagic form of dengue fever may be fatal.<br>
 Non-biting midges look like mosquitoes, but when they land on something 
they raise their front legs.<br>
 Mosquitoes raise their back legs. 
<hr width="100%" size="2H">8. Male mosquitoes have a higher pitch humming
 sound than female mosquitoes and they are attracted by the musical note
 of a B-flat<br>
 natural tuning fork.<br>
 Female mosquitoes are attracted by moisture, e.g. sweat, milk, e.g. lactating 
female, carbon dioxide and body heat.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H">9. Control of mosquitoes<br>
<a name="9.1.0H"></a>9.1.0 Methoprene, C19H34O3, is non-toxic to humans and can be used in drinking water to control mosquitoes, because it acts as a growth regulator to prevent the mosquito larva from changing from a pupa 
to an adult.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="9.2.0H"></a>9.2.0 Bti insecticide<br>
Bti insecticide (<i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> subspecies Israelensis strain EG2215) (Bti), forms when this bacterium is in unfavourable circumstances to form spores and die.<br>
 Bti is effective in killing mosquito larvae.<br>
 The serotype H14, Bti, produces 4 main toxins (Cry4Aa, Cry4Ba, Cry11Aa and Cyt1Aa) specific to dipterans (mosquitoes, blackflies and chironomous midges).<br>
 In Australia, "Barmac BTI granules" are used in salt marshes at 7.0 kg / hectare to control the salt marsh mosquito, <i>Aedes vigilax</i> at the 3rd instar or younger larval stage.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="3.3H">3.</a>03 Butterfly life cycle<br>
<a href="../images/9.7.0.gif">See diagram 9.7.0</a>: Butterfly life cycle<br>
 Teach the children to describe the different stages in the life cycle of
a butterfly.<br>
 Collect butterflies, eggs, larvae and pupae.<br>
 1. Show the examples of the stages in the life cycle of a butterfly.<br>
 Identify the different parts of the larva (caterpillar) and adult: head, 
 thorax, abdomen, antenna, mouth, eyes, legs, pro-legs, anus.<br>
 Which adult butterflies are male or female.<br>
 Why it is called a life cycle?<br>
 2. Questions about the adult butterfly: How many parts in its body? [3, 
head, thorax, and abdomen.]<br>
 How many legs? [6.]<br>
 How many wings? [4, two pairs]<br>
 How many eyes? [2]<br>
 How many things on its head? [2 antennas.]<br>
 What is its colour? [Yellow.]<br>
 Does it have a tongue? [Yes, a rolled tongue that they can unroll to lick 
honey.]<br>
 3. Put caterpillars in a box and feed daily on fresh leaves, e.g. silkworms 
 on mulberry leaves.<br>
 Observe and record the development of the caterpillars each day.<br>
 Record all changes from caterpillar to cocoon to the fully developed butterfly 
phase.<br>
 Note the time required for the individual phases.<br>
 Release the fully developed butterflies.<br>
 4. Keep some butterflies in a jar to try to see all stages in the life 
cycle.<br>
 Draw the life cycle of the butterfly.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="3.4H">3.</a>04 Grasshopper<br>
 | <a href="../images/9.9.1.gif">See diagram 9.9.1</a>: Cockroach<br>
 | <a href="../images/9.9.2.gif">See diagram 9.9.2</a>: Grasshopper<br>
 Teach the children to make a model of an insect and name its parts.<br>
 Use a completed model insect: Plasticine or clay, dead insects (one for each child) magnifiers, little sticks or tough grass stalks (for legs and feelers) pieces of paper (for wings) small stones or seeds (for 
eyes).<br>
 1. Show the children your model insect explaining how you made it.<br>
 Look carefully at their insects, the three main body parts, the six legs, 
 the feelers, eyes, wings (if any.).<br>
 Make a model of their insect from the Plasticine then use the sticks to 
put the legs and feelers in afterwards.<br>
 Little stones or seeds can be used for the eyes and paper or leaves for 
the wings.<br>
 2. Compare their models with those of other groups.<br>
 Name your insect models.<br>
 Which group has the best model? How many parts of the body are there? [3.]<br>
 How many eyes? [2.]<br>
 How many antennas? [2.]<br>
 How many legs on the middle part of the body? [6.]<br>
 How many wings on the middle part of the body? [4.]<br>
 3. Make a model insect of a butterfly or a grasshopper.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="3.5H">3.</a>05 Uses of animals and plants<br>
 Teach the children to explain how you use plants and animals to satisfy 
 your basic needs.<br>
 The basic needs are food and water, clothing and shelter.<br>
 In this lesson children will learn to appreciate how you use plants and 
animals to satisfy your needs.<br>
 Food includes energy food, growth food, and healthy or protective food.<br>
 Also it includes special foods for babies, for special ceremonies such 
as marriage and food that can be stored such as seeds and nuts.<br>
 Clothing includes things to cover and protect your bodies.<br>
 Shelter includes houses, fences, windbreaks and shade.<br>
 This lesson can be taught in two ways and you can use both: <br>
 1.1 Which plants and animals are used to satisfy these needs?<br>
 1.2 List the parts of plants and animals and ask how they are used to satisfy
your needs.<br>
 Bring some examples to the classroom.<br>
 1. Explain your need for food, clothing and shelter.<br>
 Ask the children to tell you examples of how these needs are satisfied
 by plants animals in their homes.<br>
 Where does your food come from Where does your clothing come from Where 
 does your shelter come from?<br>
 2. List parts of plants and tell the children how they satisfy your needs 
for 1. food 2. clothing 3. shelter<br>
 3. List the plants and animals you use which are 1. grown locally 2. imported.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="3.6H">3.</a>06 Care for cats<br>
<a href="../images/9.309.gif">See diagram 9.309</a>: Parts of a cat<br>
 Teach the children to care for a pet cat.<br>
 Use a pet cat or kitten to the classroom.<br>
 Cats are good pets, because they are friendly animals and they kill mice
 and rats.<br>
 However, they also kill native birds, so cats should be cared for and not
allowed to go wild in the bush.<br>
 Cats should be fed food scraps and have clean water.<br>
 They should have a
dry place to sleep and be allowed to wander about at night.<br>
 1. Show the cat to the children.<br>
 Look at the cat carefully.<br>
 What can they see? [The cat has a round head, short neck, narrow body, 
long flexible tail, covered with hair, narrow nostrils, big eyes,<br>
 eye lashes, long whiskers, large external ears that can turn to catch sound, 
has canine teeth, 4-5 pairs of teats in female, hair falls out<br>
 and is replaced, when angry the hair stands on end.]<br>
 2. Pick up the cat by the back of its neck.<br>
 Look at the feet of the cat, what can you see? [There are the pads on the
foot and on the toes.<br>
 It has claws that can be pulled in.]<br>
 Why can it pull in its claws? [It pulls in its claws to walk and not wear 
out the claws.]<br>
 3. Look at the cat walking.<br>
 Can it walk in a straight line? [Yes, it can walk side to side in a straight 
line.]<br>
 4. Stroke the cat to make it purr.<br>
 Can they make the same purring sound?<br>
 5. Look at the eyes of the cat at different times of day and night.<br>
 Can you tell the time by their eyes during the day? [The pupils of the 
cats' eyes are large at night and become a slit in the day.]<br>
 Do cats eyes shine in the dark? [Cats' eyes reflect light, but they do not
shine by themselves.]<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="3.7H">3.</a>07 Burn with a magnifier<br>
<a href="../images/23.3.7.gif">See diagram 23.3.7</a>: Burn with a magnifier<br>
 Teach the children to: 1. use a magnifier to make things look bigger 2. 
burn things with the rays of the sun.<br>
 Use a magnifier and paper.<br>
 Try this lesson before the children do it.<br>
 You may have to do method 3. outside.<br>
 1. Draw a (T) on the back of your hand.<br>
 Then look at the T with the lens close to the hand, then move the lens 
away.<br>
 What happens? [The T gets bigger.]<br>
 Then what happens? [The T disappears.]<br>
 Then what happens? [The T appears upside down.]<br>
 2. Notice the distance from the T on your hand to the lens when the T disappears.<br>
 3. Let the sunlight pass through the glass to the back of your hand.<br>
 can you see a bright spot? [Yes.]<br>
 Do your hands feel hot? [Yes.]<br>
 Move the lens up and down until your hands feel very hot.<br>
 When does it feel hottest? [When the bright spot is smallest.]<br>
 Notice the distance between the hand and the lens when the hand feels hottest.
[It is about the same distance as when the T changed to upside down.]<br>
 4. Let the children use the lens to burn paper.<br>
 The paper should be placed where the hand was before and left for sometime.<br>
 Warning: Do not let the children look at the sun through a lens.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="3.8H">3.</a>08 Water waves<br>
<a href="../images/25.3.1.3.gif">See diagram 25.3.1.3</a>: Make water waves<br>
 Teach the children to describe the movement and shape of waves in water.<br>
 Use a large flat container or a large plate, a sunny day, a dropper or outer
case of a ball point pen, flat sticks or rulers.<br>
 Children can observe that when the surface of water is disturbed by vertical 
movement, a wave moves horizontally away from the<br>
 place of disturbance, but the water itself moves up and down only.<br>
 1. Put some water in the flat container in the sun.<br>
 Let one drop of water fall into the centre.<br>
 What do you see? [A circle getting bigger and bigger.]<br>
 Tell one child to move the finger up and down just touching the surface 
 of the water.<br>
 What do you see? [The circles become bigger and bigger.]<br>
 The circles are waves.<br>
 2. Let two drops of water fall into the container at the same time.<br>
 What do you see? [The two circles of waves cross over each other.]<br>
 3. Hold a straight stick or ruler parallel to the surface of the water 
so that it just touches it.<br>
 Move the stick up and down.<br>
 What do you see? [Straight waves moving away from the stick.]<br>
 Hold two sticks at an angle parallel to the surface of the water, move 
them up and down.<br>
 What do you see? [The straight waves cross each other over.]<br>
 4. In which direction did you move the finger and the stick? [Up and down.]<br>
 In which direction did the waves move? [Outwards, along the surface of the
water.]<br>
 5. Sprinkle some small sticks or leaves on the water.<br>
 Then throw in a stone.<br>
 Which way did the stone move? [Down.]<br>
 Which way did the sticks and leaves move? [Up and down.]<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="3.9H">3.</a>09 Different colours<br>
 Use the following: <br>
 1.1 examples of the different colours to show the children violet, indigo, 
 blue, green, yellow, orange, red,<br>
 1.2 coloured paints or pencils or inks or chalks,<br>
 1.3. an old ball point pen,<br>
 1.4. small jars. 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"> Teach the children to describe colours and mixtures.<br>
 1. Describe the following:<br>
 1.1 The colours of familiar things, cloud, sky, grass, hibiscus flower, birds, pollen,<br>
 1.2 things that can have different colours, hair, clothes, flowers, pencils, hair,<br>
 1.3 things that change in colour, sky during the day, clouds on fine day and rainy day, ripening fruit,<br>
 1.4 colours that you like and colours that you dislike.<br>
For exanmple: "Green makes me calm, and red makes me angry."<br>
 1.5 ask children to describe colours as follows:<br>
 as green as [grass],<br>
 as red as [blood],<br>
 as blue as [sky],<br>
 as white as [a sheet],<br>
 as black as [night].<br>
 2. Give each group a small jar of water.<br>
 Drop in some ink.<br>
 Describe what happens to the ink: <br>
 2.1 if you do not stir it,<br>
 2.2 if you stir it.<br>
 3. Give the children different colours.<br>
 Let the children mix the colours two at a time.<br>
 What is the new colour? Then mix all the colours together.<br>
 What is the new colour? [Black.]<br>
 4. Break open an old ball point pen.<br>
 Get some colour out with a pin and put it in the water.<br>
 What do you see?<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="3.10H">3.</a>10 Rainbow colours<br>
<a href="../images/28.220.1.gif">See diagram 28.220.1</a>: Make a rainbow<br>
 Teach the children to: <br>
 1. make a rainbow form,<br>
 2. see the seven colours of the spectrum.<br>
 Use a white dish, mirror and water.<br>
 Light from the sun, and stars is called natural light.<br>
 This light is said to be white in colour.<br>
 In fact it is a mixture of seven different colours.<br>
 These colours are the same as you see in a rainbow.<br>
 The seven colours are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.<br>
 1. Who has seen a rainbow?<br>
 What does the rainbow look like?<br>
 What are the colours?<br>
 When do you usually see rainbows? [When the sun shines while it is raining.]<br>
 2. Fill a dish with water, hold a mirror sloping into the water then slowly 
move the mirror from side to side and up and down until you<br>
 get a rainbow on the wall or ceiling.<br>
 Keep the water as still as possible.<br>
 Tell each child to have a turn at making a rainbow.<br>
 3. Look carefully at the colours, count and name the colours, write the 
names of the colours, say these names you have written.<br>
 How many colours are there in a rainbow? [Seven.]<br>
 Name these colours. [red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet.]<br>
 Where do these colours come from? [The sunlight.]<br>
 4. Use a garden hose.<br>
 Take the class outside, stand with your back to the sun and squirt a fine 
spray of water from the hose into the sky.<br>
 A rainbow should be formed in the spray of water.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="3.11H">3.</a>11 Spin colour disks<br>
 Teach the children to discover what colour you see when you spin a colour 
 disc.<br>
 Use white cardboard, a pin, scissors, paints or coloured pencils: indigo, 
 blue, green, yellow, orange, red.<br>
 This demonstration is to show that when all the different colours are added
they form white light.<br>
 So white light contains all the different colours.<br>
 Black contains no colours.<br>
 1. Show the children how to draw a circle on the cardboard, cut out the 
 circle, divide the circle into seven equal segments, then<br>
 colour each segment a different colour.<br>
 2. Show the children how to push a pin through the centre of the circle.<br>
 Tell the children to spin the colour disc.<br>
 What do you see? [The disc appears white.]<br>
 When the disc slows then stops, what do you see? [The colours appear again.]<br>
 3. When you spin the disc your eye sees the colours as if they are added
 together.<br>
 Ask the children, what does that tell you about white light? [White light 
is made of the different colours added together.]<br>
 4. Use blue, green and red cellophane or glass.<br>
 Hold the three colours up to the sunlight so that they overlap.<br>
 Blue over green gives purple.<br>
 Blue over green gives blue-green.<br>
 Green over red gives yellow, brown.<br>
 Blue over red gives purple.<br>
 Blue over green over red gives black.<br>
 All the colour has been taken out of the sunlight.<br>
 The different colours are violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, 
red.<br>
 When you spin the colour disc the colours together form white.<br>

<a href="../images/26.195.gif">See diagram 26.195</a>: String telephone<br>
 (This experiment is also called "vibrating cans", because it uses vibrating
 metal drink-cans.)<br>
 Teach the children to explain that sound can travel to and from solids 
through a tight string.<br>
 Use two paper cups or the tray in two match boxes, hard twisted string 
(not soft cotton string that does not stretch), two match sticks.<br>
 Telephones are important modern communication instruments.<br>
 They transmit sound through solids.<br>
 1. Punch a small hole in the bottom of a metal drink-can.<br>
 Pass a string or fishing line through the hole with its end tied in a big
knot or tied to a match stick inside the can.<br>
 Rub a resin on the string.<br>
 Hold the can with one hand and keep the string tight with the fingers.<br>
 Draw the fingers along the string.<br>
 Sound comes from the metal can.<br>
 Repeat the experiment by drawing the fingers along the string at different 
 speeds.<br>
 Note the different pitches of sound.<br>
 Drag a wet paper towel along the string or rub your wet fingers along the
string.<br>
 Some people say it sounds like a duck or a chicken.<br>
 2. Repeat the experiment with soft styrofoam cup instead of a metal drink-can 
and tooth picks that be easily poked through the<br>
 styrofoam.<br>
 The sound quality exceeds that when using tin cups, plastic cups and paper 
cups.<br>
 3. Cut the lids out of two used tin cans or use two plastic cups.<br>
 Punch a small hole in the bottom of each can or cup.<br>
 Pass cotton or fishing line or string through the holes with the end tied 
in a big knot or tied to a matchstick inside the can or cup.<br>
 Pull the string tight.<br>
 One person speaks into the can or cap while another person presses the
 other can or cup to the ear.<br>
 Sound waves travel along the string to the bottom part of the can, which
 acts as a diaphragm.<br>
 Vibrations of the diaphragm transmit the sound waves through the air to 
the ear.<br>
 Describe what happens when you speak into this telephone.<br>
 4. Cut the lids out of two used tin cans or use cylindrical cardboard food
cartons with a metal lids.<br>
 Punch a very small hole in the bottom of each tin can and push the ends
 of several metres of thin cotton string through the holes.<br>
 Attach matchsticks or a small nut to the ends of the string inside the
 tin cans or tie a big knot in the ends.<br>
 If you cannot punch a hole through the bottoms of the tin cans attach the
ends of the string with adhesive plaster or glue.<br>
 Pull the string tight and talk and listen to the other person.<br>
 The speaker holds the tin can tightly to the face and speaks into it.<br>
 The listener person holds the other tin can tightly over the ear and listens.<br>
 The string telephone does not work around corners, because the string must 
not touch any object.<br>
 The speaker should first speak very loudly and then speak very softly.<br>
 Sound waves from the speaker's voice cause the bottom of the tin can to 
vibrate.<br>
 This vibration then moves along the tight string and then into the bottom
 of the listener's tin can.<br>
 The bottoms of the tin cans act as diaphragms.<br>
 Vibrations of the diaphragm of the listener's tin can transmit the sound
 waves through the air to the listener's ear.<br>

<a href="../images/9.231.gif">See diagram 9.231</a>: Skeleton.<br>
<a href="../images/9.232.gif">See diagram 9.232</a>: Arm joint.<br>
 Teach the children to examine bones and describe their functions.<br>
 Collect different kinds of animal bones, skull bones, backbones, ribs, 
shoulder bones, hip bones, arm and leg bones.<br>
 1. Give each group a collection of bones.<br>
 Divide the bones into different shapes.<br>
 Where are the following bones?<br>
 1.1 skull and jaw bones,<br>
 1.2 backbone,<br>
 1.3 shoulder and hip bones,<br>
 1.4 ribs,<br>
 1.5 arm and leg bones?<br>
 2. What are the functions of these bones? The skull protects the brain.<br>
 The jaws moves the mouth and the teeth are attached to them.<br>
 Backbones join to form the spine that connects all the bones.<br>
 The shoulder and hip bones connect arms and legs to the spine.<br>
 The ribs protect the lungs and heart, and allow the chest to get bigger 
 and smaller.<br>
 The arm and leg bones allow movement of arms and legs.<br>
 3. Draw and label some of these bones.<br>
 4. How is a young bone different from an old bone? [The young bone is softer
and contains soft material that makes blood, old bones<br>
 are strong and may contain fat.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H">Feel your bones<br>
 Teach the children to observe types of joints and explain how they work.<br>
 Use bones, joints and charts showing bones and joints.<br>
 1. Where a bone joins another bone is called a joint.<br>
 There are different kinds of joints: 1. Hinge joints are like a door, e.g.
the knee, the movement is only forwards and backwards.<br>
 2. Ball joints, e.g. the shoulder, allows movement in a circle, so you 
can swing your arm in a circle.<br>
 3. Pivot joints, e.g. the forearm, turns so you can turn a handle of a door.<br>
 4. Fixed joints, joints of the bones in the skull do not move, but they 
allow growth, e.g. a very young baby has a hole in the skull where<br>
 the bones have not joined.<br>
 2. Show the different kinds of joints in your body.<br>
 [jaw (hinge) | elbow (hinge and pivot) | finger (hinge) | foot (pivot)
 | upper leg (ball) | backbone (pivot) | neck (pivot and hinge)]<br>
 3. Show the children a diagram of a skeleton, point to the joints and tell
the children to say what type of joint it is.<br>
 1. Hinge joint, moves forwards and backwards<br>
 2. Ball joint, swings in a circle<br>
 3. Pivot joint, like turning a handle<br>
 4. Growth joint, allows plates of bones to get bigger.<br>

 stalks (for legs and feelers), pieces of paper (for wings), small stones 
 or seeds (for eyes]<br>
 1. Show the children your model insect explaining how you made it.<br>
 Look carefully at your insects, the three main body parts, the six legs, 
 the feelers, eyes, wings (if any.]<br>
 Make a model of your insect from the plasticine then use the sticks to put
the legs and feelers in afterwards.<br>
 Little stones or seeds can be used for the eyes and paper or leaves for 
the wings.<br>

 Teach the children to mark their height on the wall for further measurement.<br>
 1. Find a place in the classroom where you can mark heights of children
 with a ball point pen or felt pen.<br>
 You must have permission to draw on the school wall for this purpose.<br>
 2. Children should know how to mark their heights to see how they are growing.<br>
 Show the children how to stand against the wall: feet together, heels against
the wall, back against the wall, hands to the sides, head<br>
 against the wall, look straight out.<br>
 Show the children how to measure the height using a book or a ruler at right
angles to the wall, mark the wall with their initials and write<br>
 the date.<br>
 3. Practice measuring the height of other children.<br>
 Mark their height on a wall at home.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H">Teach the children to: <br>
 1. measure the height of all the children in the class,<br>
 2. record the height in writing and as a bar graph.<br>
 1. Use ruler, book, pencil or chalk, metre stick or tape measure.<br>
 Check the diagram to make sure that you know how to measure height consistently, 
 book or ruler on head and at right angles to wall.<br>
 Push down bushy hair. Push the back of the head, shoulders, buttocks and 
heels against the back of the wall.<br>
 Look straight out.<br>
 The measurer makes the mark on the wall.<br>
 Use metre stick or tape measure with zero on the floor.<br>
 Or carefully draw a metric scale or metre stick to wall.<br>
 Measure in centimetres (cm) and to a nearest millimetre (mm), e.g. height
 of the child is 15<br>
 2. Draw a bar graph to nearest centimetres, e.g. 152 cm.<br>
 3. Keep records of your height to see how fast you grow.<br>
 Show the correct way to record height and how to record it in your book, 
 Date, my height is 143. 6 cm.<br>
 Draw a big scale on the chalkboard and tell the children to read it.<br>
 Divide class into pairs.<br>
 Let the children measure each other and write their height in their books.<br>
 Write the name of the child on the chalk board.<br>
 Write their heights next to their names.<br>
 Draw a bar graph of the heights in centimetres.<br>
 Label each bar with a name.<br>
 4. Measure the children again months later.<br>
 Show the new heights as extensions of the bar.<br>

<a href="../images/9.232.gif">See diagram 9.232</a>: Movement of the arm<br>
 Teach the children to display the action of muscles in the arms and legs.<br>
 Try out this lesson on yourself before teaching it.<br>
 Muscles work only by contraction, i.e. pulling, so for each muscle that
 bends a limb, another muscle can straighten it again.<br>
 When a muscle contracts it changes in shape, but it does not change in volume.<br>
 1. Touch the fleshy part of your upper arm.<br>
 This fleshy part is called muscle, joints are moved by muscles.<br>
 2. Close one hand, and form a fist, then bend that arm at the elbow, while 
feeling the muscle of the upper arm with your other hand,<br>
 to feel the change in shape of the muscle as the arm is raised and lowered.<br>
 As the arm is raised, the muscle becomes short, fat and hard.<br>
 3. Lie on the ground on your backs and feel your stomach while raising
 your legs.<br>
 4. Explain to the children that muscles move bones by pulling on them and
that when you pull something the muscles become short<br>
 and fat.<br>
 5. Encourage the children to try many different movements, e.g. walking 
 on their toes, lifting objects, press ups, standing on hands,<br>
 knee bends.<br>
 Tell the children to feel and see their muscles and joints working.<br>
 6. Keep a straight back then bend the knees until your hand touches the 
floor.<br>
 Who can do the most knee bends Where do you feel the pain? Feel behind 
the legs above the knees, when you bend, when you straighten.<br>
 Can you feel the muscle that straightens the legs?

<a href="../images/3.17.gif">See diagram 3.17</a>: Plumb bob<br>
 Teach the children to make and use a plumb bob.<br>
 1. Cut out a 15 cm × 15 cm square of stiff paper.<br>
 Roll the paper into a cone about 15.5 cm long with a sharp point and about 
3 cm in diameter at the open end.<br>
 Use adhesive tape to secure the end flap of the paper.<br>
 Fold down the triangle of paper projecting up from the rim of the cone.<br>
 Hold the cone upside down an tap it down to produce an even edge around 
 the opening.<br>
 Apply adhesive tape over the opposite edges of the opening of the cone.<br>
 Punch two holes through the adhesive tape and paper exactly opposite each 
other.<br>
 Cut 5 cm of light string and pass it through the two holes to make a handle.<br>
 Tie knots in the ends of the string outside the holes.<br>
 Cut a piece of thread 25 cm long.<br>
 Tie one end of the thread around the string handle as a loop and tie a loop
in the other end of the thread so that it can fit around your<br>
 finger.<br>
 Put a marble or round lead sinker in the centre of the paper cone or fill 
it with sand.<br>
 2. Put the loop around you finger and check whether parts of the room are
vertical.<br>
 The thread of the plumb bob shows the vertical direction.<br>
 It is pointing towards the centre of the earth. 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="3.18H">3.</a>18 Measure our fist volume<br>
 Teach the children to measure the volume of your fist.<br>
 In this lesson children can learn two ideas.<br>
 They learn that the volume of an irregular object such as the fist is equal
to how much water displaced by it.<br>
 Also, they learn that when the fists opens or closes, the displaced volume 
of water remains the same.<br>
 Use a large glass container or tin that the children can safely put their 
 hand in, and open and close the hand.<br>
 Also, you will need a measuring jug to measure the volume of the fist.<br>
 Try this experiment with your own hand before you do it.<br>
 Make sure there are no air bubbles inside your fist.<br>
 1. Draw a line along the first line on the skin of the wrist.<br>
 Put the elbow on the desk and look at the palm of the hand.<br>
 Above the line is the hand.<br>
 Below the line is the wrist.<br>
 Curl the fingers and thumb together to form a fist above the line.<br>
 Mark the original level of water in a container. Put the fist into the
 water up to the line on the wrist.<br>
 Mark the new level of water in the container.<br>
 Open the fist under water.<br>
 The new level of water remains the same.<br>
 Take out the fist.<br>
 Pour water from a measuring jug until the level is at the new level of water.<br>
 Discuss how to measure the volume of a whole student.<br>
 2. Give out a container half full of water.<br>
 Draw a line along the first line on the skin of the wrist.<br>
 Put their elbow on the desk then look at the palm of their hand.<br>
 What is above the line? [The hand.]<br>
 What is below the line? [The wrist.]<br>
 Curl the fingers and thumb together.<br>
 What is above the line? [The fist.]<br>
 3. Mark the original level of water in the container as "A".<br>
 Put the fist into the water up to the line on the wrist.<br>
 What happens to the level of the water as the fist enters the water? [It 
rises.]<br>
 Mark the new level of water in the container as "B".<br>
 Take out the fist.<br>
 What is the new level of water? ["A"]<br>
 Pour water from the measuring jug until the level is at level "B".<br>
 How much water poured out of the measuring jug = the volume of the fist
 (B - A).<br>
 4. Use the overflow method.<br>
 Fill the container with water right to the top.<br>
 Be ready to catch any water spilled out and put it into the measuring jug.<br>
 Very slowly put their fist into the water.<br>
 Water spills over into the measuring jug.<br>
 The volume of the water spilled over is equal to the volume of their fist.<br>
 Is the volume of the fist the same as in 2? [Yes.]<br>
 5. Open the fingers, look at the open hand.<br>
 Is the volume of the hand bigger or smaller then the volume of the fist?
 [You must do an experiment to answer this question.]<br>
 How can you can test this? [Put the fist in water again.]<br>
 Put the fist in water.<br>
 What is the level of the water? [The container is full.]<br>
 Open their hand under water.<br>
 What happens to the water level? [No water spills over so the volume of 
the open hand = the volume of the fist.]<br>
 6. How do you measure the volume of the middle part of your finger from
 A to B? [Dip the finger down to level B, then down to level<br>
 A, volume of middle part is A, B.]<br>

 Use a large clock face scale balance, e.g. kitchen scale, Salter clock 
face, plastic, with pan, weighs up to 5 kg, top pan balance/ or a<br>
 small spring balance, e.g. Ohaus, 250 g rope or string, a string bag or 
plastic bag, and things that can be weighed, e.g. stones, books.<br>
 Use somewhere to hang the balances from, e.g. nails in the wall.<br>
 One group for each balance.<br>
 1. Show the children how to count around the scale of the clock face balance 
[10, 20, 30, 40 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100.]<br>
 or show the children how to count along the scale of the small spring balance
[0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250.]<br>
 2. Tell the children to draw a balance scale in their books and label it.<br>
 Note kg means kilogram and g means gram.<br>
 Kilograms and grams are used to show how heavy something is.<br>
 3. Hang the balance from a nail in the wall then hang a string bag or plastic
bag from the hook hanging below it.<br>
 Move the pointer to zero by turning the adjustment knob.<br>
 Add stones one at a time to the bag and note where the pointer moves.<br>
 Take off the stones one at a time until the pointer returns to zero.<br>
 4. Draw the scales on the chalkboard.<br>
 Show the children how to count the main subdivisions.<br>
 5. Show the children how to read the pointer to the nearest subdivision.<br>
 6. Give the children different things to weigh.<br>

 container.<br>
 Use 1.1 a graduated container, e.g. graduated cylinder, measuring jug, 
rain gauge 1.2 bottles and jars of different sizes and shapes.<br>
 Some useful measurements: 1 000 mL = one litre.<br>
 A bottle top holds about 3 mL: a teaspoon holds about 4 mL, a dessertspoon
 that you use for eating holds about 7 mL, a teacup<br>
 holds about 225 mL, a mug about 250 mL, a matchbox holds about 25 mL of 
sand.<br>
 1. Give each group some glass jars or bottles.<br>
 Look carefully at the surface of the water, especially where it touches 
 the glass.<br>
 To draw the shape of the water surface, it is called a meniscus.<br>
 2. Draw water in a graduated cylinder on the chalkboard.<br>
 3. When you measure liquids: the scale and container should be vertical 
 (show this), the eye should be in the same line as the flat water<br>
 surface, the volume is the nearest mark to the flat water surface.<br>

 1. Use a bathroom scale or sling scale to record the weight in kilograms
 of each child.<br>
 This provides an accurate record of weight which can be used when studying 
 the health of children.<br>
 Also, it can be used to place children in order of weight.<br>
 This method only allows you to place children in order of weight.<br>
 It involves using a see-saw.<br>
 The main goal here is to assist the development of the idea of rank order 
but it also draws attention to the very small children who may<br>
 be underweight and not healthy.<br>
 2. Mark a scale of weights on the wall, weigh each child on the scales 
and write the child's initials on the wall next to the child's weight.<br>
 3. Line up the children in order of weight.<br>
 Are boys heavier than girls? [At the same age most boys are heavier than 
girls.]<br>
 Now tell the children to line up in order of height.<br>
 Is it the same order? Are boys taller then girls?<br>
 4. Divide the class into age groups, each child in the group has the same

 height? Which age group has the biggest difference in weight?<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H">2. Teach the children to measure your weights and
 show them on a chart.<br>
 This lesson is the first of a continuous activity that will last for months.<br>
 Giving children measurement and recording skills is important so that they
can make a visual record of the increase of their height and<br>
 weight.<br>
 Different people such as doctors, nurses and agricultural officers use
 such records to check whether people, animals or plants are<br>
 growing properly.<br>
 They will need to draw two wall charts.<br>
 Choose the same day each month from the date of this lesson, e.g. 15th 
day of the month.<br>
 1. Show the weight charts.<br>
 Decide where to stick them on the wall. Revise how to measure weight.<br>
 Let each child measure their weight.<br>
 Let each child ask another to measure their height.<br>
 2. Show how to find the place on the chart.<br>
 If the date is the 15th of June, draw up a line from June.<br>
 Then mark each weight on the line with a cross.<br>
 3. Write the initials of the child next to the cross.<br>
 Explain later how they will read the charts: Weight chart: In June Jill
 was heavier than Jim.<br>
 In September they were the same weight.<br>
 In November Jim was heavier than Jill.<br>
 Jim increased in weight faster than Jill.<br>
 The line joining Jim's weight was steeper than the line joining Jill's 
weight.<br>
 4. Height and weight chart<br>
 Remind the children on the same date each month to measure their heights 
 and weights and record these on the charts.<br>

<a href="../images/9.53.gif">See diagram 9.53</a>: Parts of a plant<br>
 Teach the children to identify the parts of a flowering plant,<br>
 Use small plants with flowers.<br>
 You can tell the children to collect the plants before the lesson.<br>
 Any plants can be used, but they must be complete plants.<br>
 Do not use ferns, because they are not flowering plants.<br>
 1. Show the class a complete plant and name its main parts, flowers, stems, 
leaves, roots.<br>
 Which parts of the plant are usually green? [Leaves.]<br>
 Which part of the plant grows under the ground? [Roots.]<br>
 Which parts are often brightly coloured? [Flowers.]<br>
 Which part of the plant has the leaves and flowers growing on it? [Stem.]<br>
 2. Go outside and find a small plant that has flower, stem, leaves and
 roots.<br>
 3. Dig the plants up carefully, do not break off the roots.<br>
 4. Break the plant up into its various parts.<br>
 Can you name the parts? [Flowers, stems, leaves, roots.]<br>
 5. Count the number of different kinds of parts.<br>
 How many leaves, flowers, stems, roots in one plant?<br>
 6. Nature walk<br>
 Tell the children to name the parts of different trees and small plants 
 they can see during the nature walk.<br>
 Flowering plants are made up of two parts.<br>
 One part is usually found under the ground and is called the root system.<br>
 The other part usually grows above the ground and is called the shoot system.<br>
 The shoot system consists of the stem and its branches, the leaves, the 
flowers and the fruits containing the seeds.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="3.26H"></a>3.26 Leaf collection<br>
<a href="../images/9.66.2.gif">See diagram 9.66.2</a>: Leaf collection<br>
 Teach the children to collect different shaped leaves and classify them.<br>
 Use different shaped leaves.<br>
 1. Give each group a pile of leaves from different plants.<br>
 Show that all leaves have three parts: <br>
 1.1 The largest part is thin and flat. [leaf blade]<br>
 1.2 The thin and round part is like a handle. [petiole]<br>
 1.3 The little knob at the end of the handle is where the leaf joins the 
stem. [leaf base]<br>
 2. Divide the leaves into piles: <br>
 Pile 1. contains hand-shaped leaves, e.g. chilli, hibiscus, taro.<br>
 Pile 2. contains long and thin shape leaves, e.g. mango, coconut leaflets.<br>
 Pile 3. contains dented shapes, e.g. passion fruit, snake gourd, papaya 
 (pawpaw).<br>
 Pile 4. contains leaves divided into little leaves, e.g. <i>Pueraria</i>, cassava.<br>
 3. Look at the extra leaves.<br>
 Which pile do they belong to?<br>
 4. Display different leaves on a wall board.<br>
 5. Trace the shape of different leaves on paper.<br>
 Can you colour them?<br>
 6. Leaf Press<br>
 Collect many sheets of newspaper, two pieces of wood as big as a newspaper 
 page, four heavy stones.<br>
 Go outside in groups of four and collect many different leaves from all 
kinds of plants.<br>
 Return to the classroom and give each group two sheets of paper. Show how
to arrange their leaves between the sheets of paper.<br>
 Make a pile of all the collections, then place heavy stones on the top.<br>
 Put the leaf collections in a safe place and let the children look at them
after a week.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="3.27H"></a>3.27 Leaf classification<br>
<a href="../images/9.66.1.gif">See diagram 9.66.1</a>: Shapes of leaves<br>
 Teach the children to classify leaves in two ways: simple / compound and 
network / parallel veins.<br>
 Use simple leaves, e.g. <i>Hibiscus</i>, <i>Euphorbia</i>, <i>Acanthus</i>, <i>Eucalyptus</i>, breadfruit, five corner, 
guava, papaya, kumara, cassava,<br>
 and compound leaves, e.g. any of above: parallel veins, e.g. grass, coconuts, 
banana, rice, onion, bamboo, ginger.<br>
 1. What does classify mean? [It means to put things into classes.]<br>
 In this lesson the children will learn how to classify leaves in two different 
ways.<br>
 Give each group a mixture of simple and compound leaves.<br>
 Classify the leaves into two classes, simple / compound and network / parallel
veins, and tell you the character of each class.<br>
 Let the children discuss this.<br>
 2. Draw the character of simple or compound leaf on the chalkboard.<br>
 3. Mix the simple and compound leaves together again in one pile for each 
group.<br>
 Add to each pile different leaves with parallel veins.<br>
 Divide the pile into two classes.<br>
 Let the children discuss this.<br>
 Both simple and compound leaves have a network of veins.<br>
 Other leaves are long and thus have parallel veins.<br>
 4. Name some plants with simple leaves, compound leaves, leaf veins in a
network, leaf veins parallel.<br>
 4. Garden Walk<br>
 Pick some leaves in the garden and classify them.<br>
 If you scrape the leaves with your thumb nail and use a magnifier you can
see the veins clearly.<br>

<a href="../images/9.57.6.jpg">See diagram 9.57.6</a> Taproot<br> 
 Teach the children to classify stems and roots according to their functions.<br>
 Collect samples of the following groups of plants, or prepare to take children to see them:<br>
 * hibiscus, weeds, small woody plants, woody stems and tap roots,br>
 * beans and peas, soft stem and tap root grass, bamboo, maize, stem divided into sections and fibrous roots,<br>
 * grass, bamboo, maize, stem divided into sections and fibrous roots,<br>
 * pumpkin, melon, hollow stem and tap roots,<br>
 * banana, no stem and fibrous roots,<br>
 * sweet potato, yam, taro, swollen stem,<br>
 * cassava, carrot, radish, beetroot, swollen tap root.<br>
 1. Give each group different plants.<br>
 Look at the stems and the roots.<br>
 Tell the children to divide the plants according to different kinds of stems
and different kinds of roots.<br>
 Show them plants with: <br>
 1.1 woody stems.<br>
 They are hard to break.<br>
 1.2 soft stems.<br>
 They are easy to bend.<br>
 1.3 stems divided into sections.<br>
 The bumps on the grass stems.<br>
 1.4 hollow stems.<br>
 They can look through the pumpkin stem.<br>
 1.5 no stem.<br>
 The banana has a little stem under the ground, but above the ground its
 stem is made of leaf bases.<br>
 1.6 swollen stem.<br>
 The carrot is swollen with starch for food.<br>
 2. Show the children plant with a: <br>
 2.1 tap root.<br>
 It is one big root and lots of smaller roots,<br>
 2.2 fibrous roots.<br>
 It is lots of little roots,<br>
 2.3 swollen tap root.<br>
 It is swollen with starch for food, e.g. cassava.<br>
 3. Cut open the stems and roots to see the parts inside.<br>
 Can you see where the starch food is stored? [It is white, if you put some
iodine solution on it turns blue.]<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H">Teach the children to recognize different roots
 and stems and classify them.<br>
 Before the lesson walk around the school grounds and note the different
 kinds of roots and stems.<br>
 Take some roots and stems into the classroom.<br>
 Use different kinds of roots and stems.<br>
 1. Show the plants.<br>
 Can you see the roots? [They are very thin.]<br>
 Can you see the stem? [Stems are usually above the ground.<br>
 Leaves and roots are joined to stems.]<br>
 Some plants have underground stems where food is stored, e.g. ginger, sweet
potato, taro, yam.<br>
 2. Take the children outside.<br>
 Find the following: <br>
 2.1 a woody stem, e.g. Eucalyptus, mango, sugar cane, coconut,<br>
 2.2 soft stem, e.g. pumpkin,<br>
 2.3 Grass stems have overlapping leaf bases, e.g. grasses, rice, banana, 
 maize.<br>
 3. Look at the roots of a small tree and a grass.<br>
 How are they different? [A small tree has a tap root, but grass has lots 
 of little roots.]<br>
 4. Make a classroom display of different kinds of roots and stem<br>

<a href="../images/9.100.4.gif">See diagram 9.100.4</a>: Berry, drupe, legume<br>
 Teach the children to recognize different types of seeds and fruits.<br>
 Use different kinds of fruits and seeds, including a legume.<br>
 All flowering plant produce seeds inside a fruit that is sometimes called
 a pod or nut.<br>
 Before fertilization of the flower the seeds were called ovules and the 
 fruit was the ovary.<br>
 Seeds contain growth food and some healthy food and energy food.<br>
 The fruit protects the seeds.<br>
 Some fruits have hard walls that break open to let seeds out when they 
are ready to grow.<br>
 Other fruits have fleshy walls to attract birds and other animals to eat 
the fruit and seed.<br>
 These fruits are good healthy food.<br>
 1. Show children the legume pod.<br>
 Show the children the seeds inside the fruit.<br>
 What are the names of seeds and fruit that you eat? Write a list on the 
chalkboard.<br>

 Some have spines, some have parachutes.<br>
 Can you name some of these seeds and fruit?<br>
 3. Seed collection<br>
 Collect some dried fruits with seeds in them.<br>
 Crush and rub the fruits to get the seed out.<br>
 Clean the seed by picking off the outer shell.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="3.30H">3.</a>30 Prepare plant dyes<br>
 Teach the children to make plant dyes and use them.<br>
 A dye is the substance used to change the colour of something.<br>
 Before the lesson tell the children to bring some parts of plants used 
for dyes.<br>
 Use something to crush the plants, e.g. mortar and pestle, a tin that can
be heated, cloth, and mordants for permanent dying.<br>
 Use a collection of plants to make the dyes, e.g. Wild banana leaves (black), 
Banana leaves (yellow), Sweet potato leaves (green),<br>
 Hibiscus leaves (red brown), Young coconut fruit (black), Sweet potato 
 flowers (yellow), Bougainvillaea flowers (red / purple),<br>
 Turmeric root (yellow), Onion skin (yellow), Bamboo (green), Fern (brown), 
Lichens (orange / brown), Geranium flowers (red),<br>
 Morning glory flowers (yellow).<br>
 1. Show the children the parts of the plants.<br>
 Record the names and colours of each part.<br>
 2. Show the children how to crush the plants and squeeze out the juice.<br>
 Note the colours of the juices.<br>
 Are they the same as written on the chalk board?<br>
 3. Boil the juices, have they changed in colour<br>
 4. Put some dried material or dried grass in the dyes and let them dry.<br>
 5. Crush the plants in methylated spirit.<br>
 Do they get the same colours?<br>
 6. Make permanent dyes<br>
 Boil material for one hour in a mordant, e.g. three parts alum [Al2(SO4)3.K2(SO4).24H2O, 
 potash alum] and one part cream of<br>
 tartar (potassium hydrogen tartrate).<br>
 Squeeze out the mordant then boil material in the dye.<br>

 Teach the children to explain that plant foods are in the soil.<br>
 Plants can absorb something out of the soil that you use as plant food.<br>
 Plants manufacture food during photosynthesis using light, carbon dioxide, 
 water and minerals from the soil.<br>
 These minerals are usually called plant nutrients.<br>
 The Term plant food is not used, because plants make food.<br>
 They do not suck up food from the soil.<br>
 However, in primary school, you call minerals "plant foods", because this 
is easier for children to understand.<br>
 1. What did you eat today? [Food.]<br>
 Where does food come from? [Animals and plants.]<br>
 Where do animals get their food from? [They eat other animals or they eat
plants.]<br>
 Explain that all food comes from plants.<br>
 Plants are food.<br>
 2. What do plants need to grow? Have you seen plants growing in the dark 
 under a stone or under a house? [No.]<br>
 Plants need sunlight to grow and make food.<br>
 3. Why do you breathe? [You need air.]<br>
 Can you stop breathing? [No.]<br>
 Explain that plants also need air to grow.<br>
 4. Have you seen plants growing where there is no water? [No.]<br>
 Plants need water to grow.<br>
 5. If plants can move around like animals. [No.]<br>
 Why not? [They have roots in the soil.]<br>
 Explain that the roots can take two things out of the soil: <br>
 5.1 They can take out water., 5.2 They can take out plant foods.<br>
 6. What are the four things plants need to grow? They need: 6.1 sunlight, 
 6.2 air, 6.3 water, 6.4 plant foods from the soil.<br>
 Explain that if the same crops are grown in the soil year after year some 
plant foods will be used.<br>
 If you grow different crops in the same soil or if you let the soil rest 
the plant foods will not all be used up.<br>
 7. What happens if maize / yam / potato / bean is grown in the same soil 
year after year? [You get less yield.]<br>
 Why is this? [The plant foods for the crops have been used up.]<br>
 Ask some village people to explain what happens when you grow the same 
crops in the same ground year after year.<br>

paper, clear container such as plastic bags or bottles, string or<br>
 rubber bands for the plastic bags, lids for the bottles, water, garden 
soil, spades or digging sticks.<br>
 1. Take the children outside and give them some dry sand to play with.<br>
 Wet the sand and feel it.<br>
 What is the difference between dry and wet sand? [Wet sand is darker, smoother, 
sticky and easier to make shapes with.]<br>
 2. Give out the materials and tell the children to dig a 15 cm hole in the

 2. Place full jars of water over each jar of soil.<br>
 Any air in the soil will bubble out and displace water from the jars.<br>
 Which jar collected the most air? Which soil contained the most air?<br>
 3. Test the air content of the soil in your school garden.<br>
 Cover a full glass of water with a card or plastic sheet.<br>

 Place the glass on top of a full glass of dry soil.<br>
 Remove the plastic sheet or card.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H">Teach the children to show that the soil contains

 What do you see? [The level has dropped.]<br>
 Why did the level of water drop? [The air came out of the soil and the
 water took its place.]<br>
 Is there air in the soil? [Yes.]<br>
 How do you know? [You saw bubbles of air rise out of the soil.]<br>
 What was the volume of the tin containing the soil? [Volume B minus Volume 
A.]<br>
 How much air was in the tin of soil? [Volume B minus Volume C.]<br>
 3. Plant roots need the air in the soil so that they can breathe.<br>
 If there is too much water in the soil most plants die, because their roots 
do not have air to breathe.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="3.35H">3.</a>35 Soil contents<br>
 Soil is weathered rock material containing minerals plus water, air, organic 
matter and living organisms.<br>
 Soil forms a thin layer on the earth's surface.<br>
 It is the growing medium for all terrestrial plants including forests and
agricultural crops.<br>
 The approximate major components of a soil by volume are as follows: minerals 
45%, air 25%, water 25% (after rain, not air dry).<br>
 The five main components of soil: <br>
 1. Mineral particles, the inorganic fraction derived originally from rocks 
by weathering.<br>
 The main particle sizes are sand, silt and clay.<br>
 2. Organic matter, the dead and decaying plants and animals, and animal 
 products.<br>
 3. Water, the soil solution in which nutrients for plants are dissolved.<br>
 4. Air, atmosphere that fills the spaces (pores) between the soil particles 
 not filled by water.<br>
 5. Organisms, ranging in size from small animals to bacteria.<br>
 Teach the children to divide a sample of soil into different parts to see
what it is made of.<br>
 Use a spade, containers or paper, charts on soil.<br>
 Before the lesson select a place in the garden where there is deep soil
 containing lots of organic matter.<br>
 1. Take the children outside to the garden.<br>
 Give each group a space and a container or piece of newspaper.<br>
 Dig up the soil, about 10 cm × 10 cm × 10 cm.<br>
 Sort the soil into three parts: <br>
 1.1 any living things (plant or animal parts),<br>
 1.2 any things that were once living, but are now dead,<br>
 1.3 any things that were never alive, place each part on a separate piece 
of paper.<br>
 2. Look carefully at what you have found, compare what you have found with
what other groups have found.<br>
 Which group can find the most things.<br>
 3. Make a table on the chalkboard and ask each group to enter their group's 
findings in it.<br>
 Ask one member of each group to tell the rest of the class about one thing 
the group has found in the soil, e.g. stones, moss, worms,<br>
 leaves, bones, sand, fungi, ants, shells.<br>
 Use these headings for the table: Living Plants Living Animals Dead plants 
Dead Animals Non-living things<br>
 4. Different groups could dig up ground in different areas, e.g. near the
classroom, food garden, flower garden, bush, playground.<br>
 The children could then compare the different areas to see which contained 
 the most living matter.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="3.36H"></a>3.36 Waterlogged soil<br>
 Teach the children to examine the soil and find out if it is waterlogged.<br>
 Determine how to drain a waterlogged soil.<br>
 Use a spade, string and waterlogged soil.<br>
 You need access to some land that is badly drained.<br>
 1. Plant roots need air to breathe.<br>
 If there is no air in the soil, because the soil is full of water you say 
the soil is waterlogged.<br>
 Most plants cannot grow in waterlogged soils except some plants that grow 
in swamps.<br>
 You can tell when a soil is waterlogged by the following: <br>
 1.1. the soil is always wet,<br>
 1.2. the soil has a funny smell,<br>
 1.3. swamp plants may grow in it,<br>
 1.4. most useful plants die in it.<br>
 You change waterlogged soil into good soil with a drain.<br>
 The depth of the drain will be the depth of the well drained soil.<br>
 2. There are two kinds of drains: open drains and covered drains.<br>
 Open drains must be kept clear of plants.<br>
 Covered drains can be under a field.<br>
 They are made by digging a small open drain, nearly filling it with flat 
stones, cover the stones with wood or plastic, replace the soil.<br>
 Covered drains can be in concrete pipes under roads.<br>
 3. Take the children to some waterlogged soil.<br>
 Dig a hole.<br>
 Let the children smell the soil.<br>
 Find the direction of the slope of the land.<br>
 Show where you would dig a drain.<br>
 Follow some local drains.<br>
 Where do they come from and where do they go?<br>
 What is their purpose?<br>
 Most plants cannot live in waterlogged soil, because the plant roots cannot 
breathe.<br>
 You can improve waterlogged soil by draining it.<br>
 4. Plants vary in their ability to survive periods of waterlogging.<br>
 Species differ and some strains or cultivars are superior to others.<br>
 Observe which plants have survived in waterlogged areas in your district, 
 and those that are abundant on well-drained sites.<br>
 Test whether species found in waterlogged conditions can survive waterlogging 
 better than others.<br>
 Experimental problems include at what stage of growth to flood plants, 
depth of flooding, how long to flood, how to measure recovery.<br>
 5. Waterlogging, "wet feet" of many plants, e.g. olive, rosemary, even 
for small periods, can predispose them to root rot and other<br>
 disorders that affects tree growth and survival. In high rainfall areas, 
 waterlogging may be a major constraint to soil health and crop<br>
 yields, e.g. grain legume, oil-seed and cereal crops early in the growing

<a href="../images/12.303.1.gif">See diagram: 12.303.1</a> Air in a bottle<br>
 1. Air in a bottle<br>
 Place the funnel in the neck of the bottle.<br>
 Seal the space between the funnel and the neck of the bottle with heavy 
 grease or Plasticine (modelling clay).<br>
 Pour water slowly into the funnel.<br>
 The water stops running, because the air takes up space.<br>
 Repeat the experiment and pour in water until it comes nearly to the top 
of the funnel.<br>
 Use a nail to punch a hole through the seal.<br>
 All the water drops into the bottle.<br>
 The water replaces the air that comes out through the punched hole.<br>
 2. Air in a drinking glass<br>
<a href="../images/12.303.2.gif">See diagram: 12.303.2</a>: Air in a drinking glass<br>
 2.1 Float a cork on the surface of a bowl of water.<br>
 Invert a drinking glass over a bowl of water, then push the mouth down 
over the cork until the drinking glass is under water.<br>
 The cork is now floating down in the water, because air has occupies space 
in the drinking glass.<br>
 2.2 Scrunch up some newspaper in the bottom of a dry drinking glass.<br>
 Invert the drinking glass and shake it to ensure that the paper is squashed 
 against the sides and will not fall out.<br>
 Invert the drinking glass over a bowl of water, then push the mouth down 
until the drinking glass is under water.<br>
 The newspaper remains dry, because air has occupies space in the jar.<br>
 3. Blow air bubbles<br>
<a href="../images/12.303.4.gif">See diagram: 12.303.4</a>: <br>
 Place a jar full of water in the bottom of the bowl.<br>
 Use a plastic tube to blow bubbles of air into the jar.<br>
 The jar will start to float.<br>
 4. What causes the bubbles? [When air replaces some water.]<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="3.38H">3.</a>38 Float pins on water<br>
<a href="../images/4.213x.gif">See diagram 4.213</a> Float a needle<br> 
 Teach the children to show small objects can be made to float or sink in
water.<br>
 Use a pin, soap or detergent.<br>
 A clean pin washed in hot water that does not contain soap, some soap or
detergent solution.<br>
 Try this demonstration before the lesson.<br>
 1. Show the children how you can make a pin float on water.<br>
 Explain that water has a kind of skin on it.<br>
 Add some drops of detergent or soap solution.<br>
 The pin will sink.<br>
 Soap or detergent breaks the skin of the water that lets the water mix
 with other things.<br>
 2. If you have seen animals walking on water? [Water strider beetles.]<br>
 If you have seen animals hanging onto the water skin.<br>
 [Mosquito larvae.]<br>
 How do you kill them? [Add oil to the water.]<br>
 Why is soap or detergent used in washing? [It breaks the water skin and 
lets the water mix with the dirt.]<br>
 Why is the detergent or soap added to insecticides or sprays? [It lets 
the sprays mix well and wet the plant leaves.]<br>
 3. Repeat the demonstration with other small objects.<br>
 Water is covered by a thin skin, which can be broken when you put soap 
or detergent in the water to wash your clothes.<br>

<a href="../images/23.127.gif">See diagram 23.127</a>: Convection disc, Heat snake, Hot hand<br>
 Teach the children to show that hot air rises, by using the heat snake.<br>
 Use cardboard, string, scissors and candle sticks.<br>
 Practice cutting out the shape of a heat snake.<br>
 Join the string through a hole on the snake's nose.<br>
 1. Show the children how to cut a heat snake, draw the face and attach 
the string.<br>
 Hang the heat snake by the string so that it is suspended freely.<br>
 It should turn slowly.<br>
 Hold the snake over a lighted candle.<br>
 It should turn quickly.<br>
 Why does the snake turns quickly? [It turns, because the candle flame heats 
the air that rises quickly, called a convection current.]<br>
2. Fold a rectangular piece of paper along the middle and across a diagonal.
Balance the folded paper over the end of a sharp pencil where the two folds cross.
Keep still while holding the pencil tightly in your fist.
The folded paper will start to revolves as heat rises from your hot hand.
3. What would happen to air when it passes over a hot island? [The air
 rises over the land.]<br>

<a href="../images/13.2.8.gif">See diagram 13.2.8</a>: Paper aeroplane and paper aircraft<br>
 Teach the children to explain how changes in the shape of a model plane affects its flight.<br>
 Use a paper aircraft or paper to construct one.<br>
 1. Show the children how to make a paper plane.<br>
 Throw the plane to make it fly straight.<br>
 Who can throw the plane the greatest distance?<br>
 2. Tell the children to bend the end of the tail to make a rudder.<br>
 If the rudder is bent to the left, and the plane is thrown straight ahead, 
in which direction will the plane go? [Turn to the left.]<br>
 3. Tell the children to bend the ends of the wings to make elevators. How
do the elevators change direction of the flight of the plane?<br>
 [Nose goes up when elevators go up, nose goes down when elevators are down.]<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="3.41H">3.</a>41 Air and water change places<br>
 Teach the children to show that air can replace water.<br>
 Use an empty coffee tin or jar with a tight fitting lid.<br>
 Make two small holes on opposite sides of the lid.<br>
 The lid must fit tightly.<br>
 If there is only one hole in the lid both air and water are trying to move
through the hole in opposite directions so that the water does<br>
 not easily come out.<br>
 With two holes in the lid air enters through one and water can come out 
through the other.<br>
 If coconuts are available, step three could be done rather than discussed.<br>
 1. Fill the tin or jar with water and put the lid on tightly.<br>
 Turn the tin or jar upside down and see what happens. [Water drips slowly
 out of both holes.]<br>
 Turn the jar so that water comes out of only one hole.<br>
 What happens at the hole that is not letting water through? [Air bubbles 
 in.]<br>
 How do your stop the water from coming out? [Block one hole.]<br>
 2. How do you hold the tin to get water come out fastest? [Show how, because 
 the position changes.]<br>
 3. Discuss pouring water or milk out of a coconut or a sealed packet of 
drink.<br>
 Are two holes better than one? [Yes.]<br>
 Why? [The drink comes out quicker if air goes in one hole and water goes 
out through the other hole.]<br>
 4. Fill long-necked bottles with water, turn them upside down quickly and
watch the way air replaces water.<br>
 Make two holes in a tin of milk or drink.<br>
 One hole is to let the drink out.<br>
 The other hole is to let the air in.<br>
 So air replaces the drink.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="3.42H">3.</a>42 Burn different substances<br>
 Teach the children to test different substances and classify them as burn 
or do not burn.<br>
 Use a candle or burner, test materials, e.g. wire, paper, cardboard, dry 
and green wood, glass, plastic, steel wool, food, chalk,<br>
 bamboo or metal clamps for holding materials in flame a concrete or earth 
floor under the burning materials.<br>
 1. Put one substance in the clamp.<br>
 Hold the substance over the candle flame.<br>
 Watch the substance to see if it catches light.<br>
 Let it burn if it catches alight.<br>
 Repeat the test with other substances.<br>
 2. Make a list on the chalk board and divide it into two groups: substances 
 that burn, and substances that do not burn.<br>
 3. Heat a sample of garden soil.<br>
 Does all of it burn? [No.]<br>
 Does some of it burn? [Yes, the plant material burns.]<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="3.43H"></a>3.43 Solid, liquid and gas<br>
 Teach the children to observe solid, liquid and gas in a plastic drink 
bottle.<br>
 1. Screw the cap tightly on an empty plastic drink bottle.<br>
 Pick up the bottle and squeeze it in your hand.<br>
 You can squeeze the bottle and change its shape, because the bottle is full
of the gases in the air.<br>
 Gas particles move at great speed and at a great distance apart so they 
 can be squeezed together.<br>
 Gases are compressible.<br>
 If you unscrew the cap you can squeeze out most of the air in the plastic 
 bottle.<br>
 2. Fill the plastic bottle with water and replace the screw cap.<br>
 Do not leave any air in the bottle under the screw cap.<br>
 Try to squeeze the bottle full of water.<br>
 You cannot squeeze the plastic bottle, because liquids are not compressible.<br>
 Liquid particle are close together, but can roll over each other.<br>
 Liquids are not compressible.<br>
 The liquid particle s are like marbles in a drawstring bag pulled tight.<br>
 If you unscrew the cap you can squeeze out most of the water in the plastic 
 bottle.<br>
 Gases and liquids can flow so they are called fluids.<br>
 3. Put the bottle filled with water in a freezer.<br>
 The water freezes to form the solid ice.<br>
 You cannot squeeze this solid.<br>
 The particles in a solid are close together and maintain their relative
 position so a solid keeps its shape.<br>
 Solids are not compressible.<br>
 If you unscrew the cap you still cannot squeezes the ice out of the container. 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="3.44H"></a>3.44 Squeeze materials<br>
 Teach the children to squeeze different materials and observe how they 
respond.<br>
 Squeeze different materials with a potato masher, note what happens when 
you increase the force, and then decrease the force until<br>
 you remove the potato masher.<br>
 1. Some materials spring back to their original shape, elastic materials, 
 e.g. rubber eraser.<br>
 2. Some materials keep the shape when the greatest force was applied, inelastic
materials, e.g. Plasticine (modelling clay), wet clay.<br>
 3. Some materials break into small pieces, brittle materials, e.g. spaghetti, 
 glass.<br>
 4. Some materials do not change shape, tough materials, e.g. steel.<br>
