<a href="../images/9.44.gif">See diagram 9.44</a>: Ecklonia.<br>
 Teach the children to name many different plants and animals of the sea.<br>
 This lesson is designed to give children an appreciation of the great variety of plants and animals in the sea.<br>
 Do not teach the children the scientific classification in brackets over the page.<br>
 The children should list as many different types of plants and animals as possible by visiting the seashore, looking at pictures in books<br>
 and remembering their own experiences.<br>
 You cannot see microscopic animals, e.g. Protozoa or microscopic algae, but sometimes these plants and animals can change the<br>
 colour of the sea.<br>
 Bacteria are also microscopic and they cause dead plants and animals to rot.<br>
 Many large animals have a bony backbone made of a glassy substance called cartilage.<br>
 Porpoises, hippopotamuses and whales are not fish, they breathe air, have 
hair and suckle their young, so they are mammals.<br>
 Seaweed plants, e.g. Ecklonia, are large algae with no roots, stems, leaves or flowers, and  they can be red, green or brown.<br>
 Tiny floating algae or animals are called plankton.<br>
 Sea grass grows on banks outside mangrove swamps.<br>
 It is an underwater flowering plant.<br>
 1. Give descriptions (characteristics) and name examples of different animals
in the sea, e.g. soft sponges, corals sea anemones are<br>
 like flowers, tiny, long and soft worms, animals with jointed legs (shrimps), 
shellfish (molluscs), spiny skins (starfish and sea urchins),<br>
 have backbones and skeletons (vertebrates), plants (seaweed, sea grass).<br>
 Show pictures or specimens.<br>
 How many different kinds of plants or animals do you know?<br>
 Draw one specimen of each kind of animal or plant.<br>
 2. Collection of dead specimens in dilute formalin solution or methylated 
 spirit, do not kill any animals for your collection.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Animals and plants in the rivers and sea<br>
 1. Microscopic single celled animals [Protozoa]<br>
 2. Sponges (dead sponge skeletons found on beaches) [Porifera]<br>
 3. Corals, sea anemone, jellyfish [Coelenterates ]<br>
 4. Flatworms, under rocks in shallow pools [Platyhelminthes]<br>
 5. Roundworms, mainly parasites [Nematoda]<br>
 6. Beach worms, bristle worm, tube worm [Annelid]<br>
 7. Mosquito, diving beetle, cockroach [Insecta]<br>
 8. Shrimps, prawns, crayfish, crabs, barnacles [Crustacean]<br>
 9. Chitons, cowrie, cone shell, turban shell, ear shell, volute, helmet

 Bacteria and fungi (cause rotting)<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.2H"></a>5.02 Protect sea animals<br>
<a href="../images/9.307.gif">See diagram 9.307</a>: Turtle<br>
 Teach the children to explain why we should treat sea animals as a renewable 
resource.<br>
 Use conservation campaign posters for a particular country.<br>
 Before this lesson, think of some local examples of loss of natural resources, 
e.g. inshore fish.<br>
 1. Explain the meaning of the word "resource" to the children.<br>
 It means something you can use when you need it.<br>
 A forest is a resource for fuel wood.<br>
 A river is a resource for stones, clay and minerals such as gold.<br>
 2. If a resource can keep producing something that you need, you say it 
is a renewable resource.<br>
 A forest is a resource for fuel wood for many years provided you do not 
cut down all the trees.<br>
 Stones, clay and minerals are not renewable, once you take them away they 
are gone.<br>
 Living resources are renewable, a garden is a living resource that can produce
food year after year.<br>
 3. Non-living resources are not renewable.<br>
 Living resources are renewable only if some of it is used and the rest 
left to grow and reproduce.<br>
 4. The animals in the sea are one of your greatest living resources. For 
a long time in the past people have eaten only some animals<br>
 and let the rest grow and reproduce.<br>
 The animals have remained a renewable resource.<br>
 5. Nowadays people catch too many sea animals.<br>
 If you catch too many animals such as fish, porpoise and crab there may 
not be enough left to renew the resource.<br>
 Take just enough for your needs, but let most sea animals grow and reproduce.<br>
 Otherwise they will become a non-renewable resource and die out.<br>
 This will be a great loss to future generations in your country.<br>
 Recent government efforts in many countries focus on campaigns through 
various establishments and institutions to do and ensure<br>
 systematic conservation of natural resources.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.3H"></a>5.03 Coral, sea anemone<br>
<a href="../images/9.305.gif">See diagram 9.305</a>: Shells<br>
 Teach the children to identify these animals and explain that these animals 
all have the same basic structure.<br>
 Use different coral specimens and pictures or specimens of sea anemones 
 and jellyfish.<br>
 You can teach this lesson on a coral reef or in the classroom.<br>
 1. If you have seen pieces of coral and a coral reef.<br>
 Explain that coral is made up of many tiny animals each of which has a coat
of hard lime.<br>
 The lime coats stick together to make the pieces of coral and the coral 
 reef.<br>
 The coral animals die leaving the dead coral made of lime.<br>
 Show pieces of coral.<br>
 Is it alive? [No.]<br>
 Where did the coral animals live? [In the holes in the dead coral.]<br>
 Can you name different kinds of coral? The coral animals are so small you
cannot study them.<br>
 2. However, sea anemones are much larger, have soft bodies and are similar 
to coral animals.<br>
 The sea anemone has three main parts:<br>
 2.1 tentacles that can catch food,<br>
 2.2 mouth,<br>
 2.3 stomach.<br>
 Tentacles can kill small fish by stinging them with poison.<br>
 Can you put a finger in a sea anemone's mouth?<br>
 Sea anemones are called the "flowers of the reef", because they have bright 
colours.<br>
 Sea anemones live in rock pools and catch animals with their tentacles.
 Sometimes they pick up shells so they can hide.<br>
 Sometimes there is a friendly fish that swims among the tentacles and does
not get stung.<br>
 3. A jellyfish does not look like a sea anemone or coral animal, but it 
does have the same three parts: tentacles, mouth and stomach.<br>
 4. Look at the drawing of the coral animal cut open.<br>
 Turn it upside down.<br>
 Imagine the soft body swelled up with jelly.<br>
 Now you have a jellyfish.<br>
 Jellyfish float in the sea.<br>
 Jellyfish can sting fish with their tentacles then eat them.<br>
 Jellyfish can sting people.<br>
 Some of them glow at night.<br>
 They swim very slowly.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.4H"></a>5.04 Shellfish and snails<br>
<a href="../images/9.305.gif">See diagram 9.305</a>: Shells<br>
Teach the children to describe and name different kinds of molluscs, shellfish 
and land snails.<br>
Use examples of molluscs, shellfish and land snails.<br>
Collect different kinds of shells or shellfish and land snails.<br>
You can also prepare the class for an excursion to the coral reef.<br>
A live land snail or a shellfish in a jar of sea water will interest the 
children.<br>
 Little land snails (<i>Limocolaria</i>) can be collected at night or early 
in the morning.<br>
 Shellfish are called Molluscs.<br>
 1. If you know an animal that has a soft body and carries its house on its
back. [A land snail or sea snail.]<br>
 Explain that their body is divided into three parts: head, foot and coiled 
stomach.<br>
 The head has a mouth and eyes at the end of tentacles.<br>
 The body can be pulled into a coiled shell.<br>
 Sometimes the house has a door made of hard shell.<br>
 Molluscs can move along using their big foot.<br>
 2. Snails are one kind of animal called molluscs.<br>
 There are four different kinds of molluscs:<br>
 2.1 Snails, have a single coiled shell, e.g. land snails, cowries, ear shells, 
cone shells, auger shells, helmet shell, volute, baler shell.<br>
 Some have lost their shell, e.g. land slugs and sea slugs.<br>
 2.2 Chitons have flat plates instead of a shell, a small head and a big 
foot.<br>
 2.3 Bivalves have two flat shells joined by a muscle that can close them 
together, like clapping hands.<br>
 Some can use the foot to burrow in the sand, e.g. scallop, cockle and muscle.<br>
 Others are fixed in one place, e.g. oyster, clam.<br>
 2.4 A squid and octopus foot is divided into eight arms.<br>
 Squids can swim by squirting water out backwards.<br>
 The squid has a small internal shell and the octopus has no shell.<br>
 How many kinds of molluscs can you find?<br>
 Make a shell collection and name the types of shells from different localities.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.4.1H"></a>5.4.1 Shellfish, molluscs<br>
 Teach the children to classify shells into groups based on observed similarities 
and differences.<br>
 Collect different types of shells and tell the children to bring some.<br>
 1. Give each group a pile of mixed shells.<br>
 2. Sort the shells into small groups.<br>
 You must say why you put shells into a particular group.<br>
 Do not tell the children how to do it.<br>
 Let the children decide their own groupings.<br>
 3. Pick out one shell from a group.<br>
 Why did you put it into that group? [Some possible answers: the shells 
look the same, and have the same colour, same shape, same<br>
 markings.]<br>
 4. Do you know the common name for each group? [Some examples include scallop, 
top shell, cone shell, snail shell, cowrie, clam.]<br>
 5. Arrange the shells in each group in order of size.<br>
 6. Draw the medium-sized shell of each group in your book.<br>
 7. Make a collection of shells for the class.<br>
 Label the shells with common names.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.4.2H"></a>5.4.2 Shellfish, molluscs<br>
 Teach the children to explain why we should protect shellfish.<br>
 Shellfish are molluscs.<br>
 Molluscs have a body divided into three parts: head, a large foot, and coiled
stomach in a shell.<br>
 Explain that shellfish are interesting animals that are part of the natural 
heritage.<br>
 If shellfish are all killed, because more people are eating them or selling 
the shells, then something that you all own would be lost.<br>
 Some shellfish appear on postage stamps: Cowrie, Trochus, Glory-of-the-Sea, 
 Bailer Shell, Pearly Nautilus, Conch, Triton.<br>
 Shellfish are valuable for four reasons:<br>
 1.1 Shellfish are part of the food web, plants and animals depend on each 
other for food and shelter.<br>
 These plants and animals have lived in the local natural environment for 
a long time, because there is a balance of numbers.<br>
 If we kill too many of one kind of plant or animal, you upset the balance 
 and other plants and animals will be affected.<br>
 1.2 Shellfish are a source of valuable growth food.<br>
 Yet the human population is increasing rapidly and some kinds of shellfish 
 on the coast could all be eaten.<br>
 1.3 Shellfish are a source of money.<br>
 Some shells such as Cowrie, Trochus and Glory-of-the-Sea can be sold to 
overseas buyers.<br>
 Also, tourists like to buy shells to remember the country they have visited.<br>
 1.4 Shellfish are a part of our natural environment for all people to look
at and enjoy.<br>
 These shellfish are part of your culture and history.<br>
 Ancestors were famous for the inlay work in carvings using Pearly Nautilus 
 shell.<br>
 If all these shellfish were killed this traditional art work would be lost.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Before the lesson, tell the children to bring some 
 shells.<br>
 1. Show the children the shells and pictures of shells.<br>
 Do people eat them? [Yes.]<br>
 Do people use them? [Yes, e.g. Baler Shell.]<br>
 Do people sell them? [Yes, to tourists.]<br>
 Do people make anything with them? [Yes, Mother-of-pearl inlay work for 
traditional decoration and to sell to tourists.]<br>
 2. Explain how shells are part of your natural heritage.<br>
 Shells are something our ancestors owned, something you own, and something 
 that should be still living for your children.<br>
 3. Explain why shellfish are valuable for the:<br>
 * food web,<br>
 * food,<br>
 * money in culture.<br>
 4. Explain why shellfish could all be killed:<br>
 * There are more people now than before,<br>
 * there are more canoes with outboard motors and people with diving equipment,<br>
 * there are more people want to sell shells,<br>
 * there are more foreign boats and tourists.<br>
 5. Explain how children can protect shellfish:<br>
 5.1 Tell people about the importance and the danger of killing too many 
shellfish.<br>
 5.2 Tell children to watch foreign boat crews and tourists.<br>
 5.3 Not to kill the shellfish unless very hungry.<br>
 6. Display of shells under the heading "Our Natural Heritage"<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.5H"></a>5.05 Starfish, sea urchin<br>
<a href="../images/9.304.gif">See diagram 9.304</a>: Echinoderms<br>
 Teach the children to identify and list the different types of echinoderms.<br>
 Use drawings and preserved specimens of types of echinoderms.<br>
 The spiny skinned animals, called echinoderms are found only in the sea.<br>
 Echinoderms have a circular design.<br>
 If you cut through the centre of their mouth in any direction the two halves
look the same.<br>
 Beside having spines in their skins or spines sticking out, echinoderms 
 have hundreds of little tube feet to help them move along the<br>
 bottom of the sea.<br>
 The starfish usually has five arms and a mouth facing down.<br>
 Starfish can suck on to the shell of a bivalve mollusc such as an oyster, 
 pull open the shells then eat the inside.<br>
 Brittle stars have a separate round body and long legs that they can drop 
off when they are frightened.<br>
 Sea urchins are globe shaped, have long spines and downwards facing teeth 
that can grind a hole in a shellfish.<br>
 Beche-de-mer is an example of the sea cucumbers that have lost their spines.<br>
 When frightened, beche-de-mer they spit out their stomach.<br>
 Beche-de-mer or trepang is exported overseas for Chinese soup.<br>
 Use specimens or pictures of these animals.<br>
 The following groups of spiny skinned animals are called Echinoderms:<br>
 1.1 Starfish,<br>
 1.2 Brittle stars,<br>
 1.3 Sea urchins,<br>
 1.4 Sea cucumbers, e.g. beche-de-mer.<br>
 1.5 Feather stars<br>
 1. Show drawings or specimens of these animals.<br>
 What are their common features? [Shape, spiny skins, live on the sea bottom.]<br>
 2. Look at the starfish.<br>
 Does it have a front or back? [No.]<br>
 Are the arms different? [No.]<br>
 How does it move? [With its tube feet.]<br>
 What are the arms for? [To pull apart the shells of shellfish.]<br>
 3. Draw each different kind.<br>
 The aim is to perfect observation and creativity in them.<br>
 4. Make a collection of dead echinoderms, but do not kill any animals on
the reef.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.6H"></a>5.06 Fish life cycle<br>
<a href="../images/9.301.gif">See diagram 9.301</a>: Life cycle of a fish<br>
<a href="../images/9.302.gif">See diagram 9.302</a>: Shark, Bony fish<br>
 Teach the children to explain the life cycle of a bony fish.<br>
 Use illustrations of the life cycle of a fish.<br>
 Bring some freshwater fish to class.<br>
 25.0 Class Chondrichthyes (sharks, dogfish, stingrays, rays, cartilaginous 
 fish, elasmobranchs)<br>
 26.0 Class Osteichthyes, bony fish (Class Actinopterygii, ray-finned fish)<br>
 Sharks, dogfish and stingrays do not have a skeleton made of bones.<br>
 Their skeleton is made of a clear substance that can bend easily called 
 cartilage.<br>
 So sharks and stingrays are called cartilaginous fish.<br>
 Most fish have hard bones so they are called bony fish.<br>
 Show the diagrams of the life cycle of a fish to explain the following 
points:<br>
 1. A female fish lays eggs in the water and a male fish puts many sperm 
 into the water near the eggs.<br>
 2. Many eggs are not fertilized.<br>
 3. Only those that are fertilized become little fish.<br>
 4. Many little fish are eaten, so only a few grow into adult fish.<br>
 5. The female fish must lay thousands of eggs if some are to grow into 
adult fish.<br>
 6. Examine closely the adult fish.<br>
 Can you see any differences between the male and female fish?<br>
 Can you draw the differences?<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.7H"></a>5.07 Sea food chains<br>
  Teach the children to explain the importance of keeping the food chains 
 in the sea unbroken.<br>
 Use plants and animals in the environment and in the sea.<br>
 Children should understand that all plants and animals in the sea are important
because they are related by food chains.<br>
 Plants and animals depend on each other for food.<br>
 Also, when plants and animals die their bodies are rotted by bacteria to
be used by simple plants and animals again.<br>
 You can think of the food chains usually or by particular examples.<br>
 An example of a food chain is seaweed is eaten by a shellfish is eaten 
by a fish is eaten by a bird.<br>
 Seaweed --> Shellfish --> Fish --> Bird.<br>
 When each of these animals dies, the material in their bodies decomposes 
 and can be used by the seaweed again.<br>
 However, if you eat all the shellfish or fish then the food chain is broken.<br>
 Usually plants are eaten by animals are eaten by larger animals are eaten 
by larger animals.<br>
 If "&gt;&gt;" means "is eaten by", you can show a food chain as: plants 
 &gt;&gt; small fish &gt;&gt; big fish &gt;&gt; shark &gt;&gt; man<br>
 If we kill all the animals or plants in any step of the food chain then 
the food chain is broken and all the living things in the food chain<br>
 are affected.<br>
 1. Give examples of living things in the sea eating other living things, 
 e.g. smaller fish eaten by sharks.<br>
 Write all the examples on the chalk board.<br>
 So far you have steps in the food chain, tell the children to tell you a
third or fourth step, e.g. seaweed, fish, shark, man.<br>
 2. Can you make different food chains?<br>
 Can you make food chains with many steps?<br>
 Try this with the children and write the steps on the chalk board.<br>
 3. What is passed along the food chain? [The material in the bodies of the
plant and animals.]<br>
 What happens to the materials when the plants or animals die and are not 
eaten? [They rot.]<br>
 Is the material of their bodies lost from the food chain? [No, simple plants
and animals can use it again.]<br>
 4. Show the general food chain.<br>
 Plants fish one fish two shark<br>
 5. The dotted lines show the bodies of dead plants and animals made rotten 
by bacteria then used by plants again.<br>
 What would happen if you caught all the fish? [There would be no food for
fish two and later no food for the sharks.<br>
 The food chain would be broken.]<br>
 6. Name any kinds of animals or plants in the sea that could be wiped out
by too much fishing or hunting.<br>
 How many animals of the sea should you catch? [Catch some, but do not catch 
so many to break the food chain.]<br>
 7. Discussion with an old fisherman or fisheries officer on whether there 
are as many fish now as before.<br>
 Are some food chains already broken? Visits to agricultural departments
 (fishery section) can help us to find out more about this.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.8H"></a>5.08 Water wheel<br>
<a href="../images/9.2.1.gif">See diagram 9.2.1</a>: Water wheel<br>
<a href="../images/4.199.gif">See diagram 4.199</a>: Overshot water wheel<br>
A water wheel is a source of hydroelectric power.<br>
 Teach the children to make a water wheel and show how moving water can turn
a wheel.<br>
 Use water, hose, or water in a bucket.<br>
 The wheel can be made in any of the following ways:<br>
 1.1 Use thin bamboo, with thin pieces of tin or cardboard for the blades 
 and a smooth stick for an axle.<br>
 1.2 Use pawpaw stalks instead of bamboo with a smooth stick for an axle.<br>
 1.3 Cut a small square of coconut husk.<br>
 Make a hole in the middle with a hot nail.<br>
 Push the pieces of tin in the sides.<br>
 Let it spin on the nail or a smooth stick.<br>
 1.4 Cut a round piece of paper or taro stem.<br>
 Stick very stiff leaves round the edge.<br>
 Spin on a smooth stick.<br>
 1.5 Stick Plasticine (modelling clay) around a piece of bamboo.<br>
 Stick cardboard or tin pieces in the Plasticine.<br>
 Spin on a smooth stick.<br>
 1.6 Use an empty cotton reel and tin sheets.<br>
 Spin on a nail.<br>
 1. Give out the materials and show how to make their water wheels.<br>
 2. Put the wheel in running water under a tap or by pouring water over 
it.<br>
 What happens? [The wheel turns when the water hits the blades.]<br>
 Increase the speed of the water.<br>
 What happens to the water wheel? [It turns faster.]<br>
 3. What happens when the wheel is placed in running water. [It turns or 
spins.]<br>
 What happens if you increase the speed of the water? [The wheel turns faster.]<br>
 How can you increase the speed of the water? [By opening the tap more, 
by making the water fall further.]<br>
 4. Collect the water wheels and keep them for the lesson on Steam Wheels.<br>
 5. Water wheels are used to generate hydroelectricity.<br>
 the electrical generator is often placed at the bottom of a water fall 
and water is lead to it in a pipe from the top of the waterfall.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.9H"></a>5.09 Steam wheel<br>
<a href="../images/9.2.1.gif">See diagram 9.2.1</a>: Steam wheel<br>
 Teach the children to show that steam can turn wheels.<br>
 Use water wheels from previous lesson on water wheels.<br>
 Cans with tight fitting lids with a small hole in the lid.<br>
 Burners, heating stand and water. Make the holes in the tin lids with a
nail.<br>
 Do not put too much water in the tin as it will take too long to boil and
produce steam.<br>
 About four cm should be enough.<br>
 1. Give out the materials and tell the children to pour water into the can
and then fit the lid on tightly.<br>
 Place the can of water on a heating stand.<br>
 Light the burner and heat the water.<br>
 2. When the water is boiling tell the children what is coming out of the 
hole in the tin lid. [Steam.]<br>
 3. Take it in turns to hold your water wheel over the hole in the lid as
shown in the diagram.<br>
 4. What happens? [The wheel turns.]<br>
 5. What is formed when water boils? [Steam.]<br>
 What causes the wheel to turn? [Steam.]<br>
 Which can turn a wheel faster, water or steam? [Steam.]<br>
 6. The wheels of a steam engine are turned by steam.<br>
 Steam engines are used to make electricity, drive trains and boats.<br>
 Wood or coal is burnt to heat water to produce the steam.<br>
 Steam boats and trains are not common now.<br>
 However, in many countries most of the electricity is made from burning 
 coal in steam engines that turn on electric generators.<br>
 7. Draw pictures of steam engines used in boats, trains and power stations.<br>

 lines<br>
<a href="../images/28.105.1.gif">See diagram: 28.105.1</a>: Light travels in straight 
lines<br>
 Teach the children to show that light travels in straight lines.<br>
 Use 3 pieces of cardboard about 25 cm × 25 cm for each group, candles or
a torch or a mirror to reflect sunlight, jar of water,<br>
 chalk dust, piece of string, rubber tubing or pawpaw petiole about 50 cm
long.<br>
 Light is invisible, it cannot be seen.<br>
 Completely transparent substances, like air it also cannot be seen, because 
you allow all light to pass through them.<br>
 You cannot see light passing through air or water unless the air or water 
has something in it, e.g. chalk dust, street dust that will<br>
 reflect the light into your eyes<br>
 1. Use a pin to cut a hole in three pieces of cardboard.<br>
 Hold each piece of cardboard about 10 cm apart.<br>
 Thread a piece of string through the holes and pull very tight.<br>
 Place a candle in line with the string. Take away the string and tell the
children to look through the hole at the candle.<br>
 2. Can you see the candle? [Yes.]<br>
 What would a line from your eye through the holes to the candle look like? 
[A straight line.]<br>
 3. Move one piece of cardboard.<br>
 Can you see the candle? [No.]<br>
 Why not?<br>
 4. Put some chalk dust in a jar of water.<br>
 Shine some light through it.<br>
 How does the light travel? [In a straight line.]<br>
 Can light bend? [No.]<br>
 Can light go around corners? [No.]<br>
 5. You see around corners with a mirror, but the light still travels in 
straight lines.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.11H"></a>5.11 Mirror reflects light<br>
<a href="../images/28.2.2d.gif">See diagram 28.2.2</a>: Reflection in a plane mirror<br>
<a href="../images/28.2.13.gif">See diagram 28.2.13</a>: Reflection of a clock
in two mirrors<br>
<a href="../images/5.11.gif">See diagram 5.11</a>: Two mirrors<br>
 Teach the children to show how light travels when it is reflected by a mirror.<br>
 Use mirrors, cardboard and scissors, shiny surfaces, e.g. aluminium foil, 
tin lids, rubber ball.<br>
 Practice before the lesson with the recommended materials.<br>
 1. Give out two mirrors and different shiny surfaces to each group.<br>
 2. Use a mirror and shiny surfaces to reflect a beam of sunlight along 
the floor, or the ground or along the top of a desk.<br>
 Which things reflect the light best? [Materials with smooth shiny surfaces.]<br>
 3. Use scissors to cut a slot out of your piece of cardboard, to put the 
slot over the beam of light.<br>
 4. Turn the second mirror to reflect the thin beam of light to the left, 
to the right, up and down.<br>
 5. Tell one child to stand against a wall holding the second mirror to the
chest.<br>
 Another child should reflect light on to the second mirror from the first 
mirror.<br>
 A third child can then see the reflected light.<br>
 Tell another child to throw a rubber ball from the first mirror at the wall
behind the second mirror.<br>
 Where does the ball go? [It bounces off the wall in the same direction 
as the light.]<br>
 Reflection occurs when light bounces off shiny surfaces.<br>
 6. Place two mirrors at right angles and a bottle top between.<br>
 How many reflections are there?<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.12H"></a>5.12 Image with a lens<br>
<a href="../images/28.1.1.5.gif">See diagram: 28.1.1.5</a>: Image with a lens<br>
 Teach the children to form an image on a screen using a lens and can describe 
the image and measure its distance from the lens.<br>
 Use candles or flame, white paper for screens, you can rub some cooking 
 oil on the paper to make a better screen, magnifiers.<br>
 Darken part of the classroom.<br>
 Formation of images on screens and distance measurement are the real focus 
of this lesson.<br>
 1. Put the candle, lens and screen in a darkened area so that the image 
 of a candle can be seen on the screen.<br>
 Place the lens at 10 cm from the screen to get the sharpest image.<br>
 2. Describe the image. [Small and upside down.]<br>
 What happens when you move the lens closer to the candle? [The image gets 
larger and is still upside down.]<br>
 When is the size of the image is about equal to the size of the candle 
flame? [When the lens is about half way between the screen and<br>
 the candle.]<br>
 3. Look at images of objects outside the classroom.<br>
 Describe them. [The images are smaller than the objects and they are upside 
down.]<br>
 4. Lenses are found in eye glasses, cameras, binoculars, projectors.<br>
 5. Where is the screen in your eye? [The screen is at the back of the eye, 
the lens is at the front of the eye where light enters.<br>
 So in your eye the distance between the screen and the lens stays the same.]<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.13H"></a>5.13 Water drop magnifier<br>
<a href="../images/28.1.17.gif">See diagram 28.1.17</a>: Water lens<br>
 Teach the children to make a water drop microscope and use it to describe 
 the structure of small objects.<br>
 You need a piece of cardboard and a piece of sticky tape.<br>
 Punch a hole through the sticky tape and the cardboard.<br>
 Put a drop of water on the hole to make a water drop microscope.<br>
 To use the microscope attach it to a ruler at with sticky tape, put some 
hair or a leaf on the paper, look down through the water drop<br>
 and move the pencil between the book and paper.<br>
 1. Show the curved surfaces of their magnifying lenses.<br>
 [Glass with a curved surface can magnify, make things bigger.]<br>
 We can make a curved shape out of water, a kind of lens.<br>
 2. Show how to make the water drop microscope.<br>
 Show how to set up the water drop microscope.<br>
 Look at the shape of the drop very carefully.<br>
 3. Put a small printed word under the water drop microscope, e.g. CAT.<br>
 Write this word at the size you see it.<br>
 4. Move the microscope up and down.<br>
 Focus it until the printed letters look bigger.<br>
 The children may have to remove a little water from the drop with their 
 fingers until the printed letters look bigger.<br>
 5. Put a little bit of sugar on their paper.<br>
 Spread the sugar under the microscope and then observe it.<br>
 6. Look at different things using your microscope, e.g. soil, ants, roots, 
feathers.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.14H"></a>5.14 Pinhole camera<br>
<a href="../images/28.105.2.gif">See diagram: 28.105.2</a>: Pinhole camera<br>
 Teach the children to make a pinhole camera.<br>
 The pinhole camera is just a light proof box using a pinhole about 0.5 mm
in the centre of one side instead of a lens.<br>
 The opposite side of the box can be a translucent screen or photographic 
 film that can be exposed.<br>
 Some modern photographers use the pinhole camera to obtain its unique soft
images and distortions in perspective.<br>
 These images the human eye would never see.<br>
 The pinhole camera is similar to the "camera obscura".<br>
 Teach the children to make a pinhole camera and describe the difference 
 between the image and the object.<br>
 Use paper screen, nearby objects.<br>
 Make a pinhole camera before the lesson.<br>
 An image is the picture of an object on a screen.<br>
 The image of a pinhole camera on a screen is upside down.<br>
 1. Show your pinhole camera.<br>
 2. Make a small hole in the bottom of the tin using a nail.<br>
 Cover the open end of the tin with a piece of thin paper, e.g. typing, 
tracing or greased paper.<br>
 This is the screen on which the picture will be formed.<br>
 Use a rubber band or a piece of string to hold the paper on the tin.<br>
 Tie a piece of newspaper around the tin to form a tube.<br>
 This makes the screen dark.<br>
 The picture is easier to see in the dark.<br>
 3. When the children have made their pinhole cameras tell the children 
to point them towards the door or windows.<br>
 Let the children look at trees, buildings through their pinhole cameras.<br>
 4. This is how a real camera works except that the paper screen is the film
covered with light sensitive substances.<br>
 5. Measure height of object / height of image, and distance from object 
 to pinhole / distance from pinhole to screen.<br>
6. The first camera designed for use by children was a box camera manufactured
by KODAK in 1900 called a "Brownie".<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.15H"></a>5.15 Breathing in and out<br>
<a href="../images/9.242.2.gif">See diagram 9.242.2</a>: Lungs<br>
<a href="../images/9.242.1.png">See diagram 9.242.1</a>: Simulated diaphragm<br>
 Use a watch with a second hand, bucket with a handle.<br>
 The following lessons are designed with two aims:<br>
 To give children experience in observing their breathing mechanism and<br>
 to improve observation of their own bodies.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">1. Tell the children to sit quietly watching you.<br>
 What are you doing? [Nothing. we are just sitting still. We are not doing 
anything].<br>
 You are sitting still, but you are also breathing in and out.<br>
 Did you realize you were breathing? [No.]<br>
 What made you breathe in and out? [It just happens.]<br>
 Your brain makes you breathe in and out.<br>
 You don't have to think about it.<br>
 It is automatic.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">2. The children sit quietly watching you.<br>
 Tell the children that you will count to 100, using the seconds hand of 
a watch.<br>
 Tell the children to close their mouths, hold their noses and stop breathing.<br>
 Then they can start breathing again.<br>
 Give the order and start counting.<br>
 Why did YOU not wait until the count of 100? [We had to breathe again before
you counted to 100.]<br>
 What made you breathe again? [The brain.]<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">3. Tell the children to breathe in and out very
 deeply 20 times.<br>
 Then say "Stop" and start counting to 100.<br>
 How long can you hold your breath now?<br>
 [About one minute.]<br>
 Why can you hold your breath longer?<br>
 your body needs oxygen gas.<br>
 If you breathe in deeply, your body stores some oxygen gas in the lungs 
so you can hold your breath longer.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">4. Push one finger up under the lowest right rib.<br>
 Breathe deeply in and out.<br>
 What happens to their ribs when you breathe in? [They rise.]<br>
 Show the bucket.<br>
 If your rib is like the handle of the bucket, when you breath in it is like
raising the handle of the bucket.<br>
 When you breathe out, the handle of the bucket goes down.<br>
 Feel up under your ribs again and breathe in deeply.<br>
 What happens to your finger when you breathe in? [It is pushed down.]<br>
 What pushes it down?<br>
 Explain that a big muscle called the diaphragm pushes the finger down.<br>
 If you run a long way, you may get a pain in your diaphragm called a "stitch".<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">5. Does your the chest gets bigger or smaller
when you breathe in? [Bigger, the chest expands.]<br>
 What part of the chest moves? [Two parts, the ribs turn up like a bucket 
handle and the diaphragm pushes down.]<br>
 When you breathe in where does the air go? [It goes into the lungs.]<br>
 Where are the lungs? [There is one lung in each side of the chest.]<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">6. Why do you breathe in air? [Our body needs
oxygen gas.]<br>
 At the start of the lesson, why were you breathing quietly? [We do not need
much oxygen when sitting quietly.]<br>
 What happens to your breathing when you start running? [We breathe more 
quickly and deeply.]<br>
 Why do you breathe more when you are running? [Our body needs more oxygen 
gas.]<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">7. Sentence Completion:<br>
 You breath in, because your body needs [oxygen] gas.<br>
 Your body gets oxygen gas from [the air]<br>
 when you are sleeping or sitting quietly, do you breathe quickly or slowly?<br>
 We breathe slowly, because we do not need so much [oxygen gas].<br>
 When you are running, do you breathe quickly or slowly?<br>
 We breathe quickly, because we need much more [oxygen gas].<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">8.Breathe in and out rapidly through your nose
 and then through your mouth.<br>
 What do you notice? [The nose warms the air before you breathe it in.]<br>
 Close your mouth and hold your nose then try to breathe out.<br>
 What do you notice?<br>
 [We feel pressure inside the ear.]<br>
 This pressure is caused by the air pressing against skin in the ear called 
ear drums.<br>
 If you swallow, the pain will go away.<br>
 You may feel this pressure when you are in a landing aircraft and it makes 
babies cry.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.20H"></a>5.20 Digestion of food<br>
 Teach the children to observe and discuss what happens during digestion 
 by examining an animal's stomach.<br>
 Use food, chicken or rat, scissors and knife, chloroform solution and lens.<br>
 Recall the methods of studying internal organs of animals by means of dissection.<br>
 1. Digestion of food is in two stages:<br>
 1.1 Breakdown of food into smaller parts using teeth and tongue in the mouth, 
<br>
 1.2 Softening of the food by saliva in the mouth and acid in the stomach.<br>
 2. Let the children bite a dry biscuit, their teeth and tongue break it 
into smaller pieces, after a short time it tastes sweet, because the<br>
 saliva changes starch into sugar.<br>
 How many dry biscuits can you eat?<br>
 Nobody can eat more than two dry and salty "SAO" biscuits, because, after 
eating two biscuits, the saliva is used up.<br>
 3. Kill a chicken or toad and show the children the stomach.<br>
 Use the solution of chloroform.<br>
 It is like a bag made of hard muscle.<br>
 This muscle can mix the food with acid.<br>
 4. Cut open the stomach with scissors.<br>
 Turn the stomach inside out and show the children the digested contents.<br>
 5. Wash out the inside of the stomach and let the children examine it with
a hand lens.<br>
 Can you see the folds in the walls?<br>
 6. Show the children the inside of a cow's stomach called tripe.<br>
 You can buy this in a butcher's shop or get it from a cow killed in a local
ceremony.<br>
 Compare the size with the stomach of a rat or rabbit.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.21H"></a>5.21 Water finds its own level<br>
<a href="../images/12.0.0.gif">See diagram 12.0.0</a>: Water finds its own level<br>
 Teach the children to show that the surface of water is always horizontal.<br>
 Use plastic tubing, ruler or metric stick, hose, water.<br>
 The depth of liquid in a vessel remains the same and does not depend on 
the shape of the vessel containing it.<br>
 1. Give out empty plastic tubes, water and rulers.<br>
 Pour some water above the desk in each arm.<br>
 What the difference is in height? [No difference.]<br>
 Pour some more water in and measure again.<br>
 What is the difference? [No difference.]<br>
 Draw a tube showing the level of the water and the horizontal line joining 
the level.<br>
 2. Hold one arm of the tube vertical then move the other arm apart keeping 
it vertical.<br>
 What happens to the height of the water in each arm? [It drops a bit.]<br>
 Compare the height of the water in each arm. [The heights are the same.]<br>
 3. Keep one arm of the tube steady, then bend down the other arm.<br>
 What happens to the height of water in each arm? [The height drops the same
in each arm of the tube.]<br>
 4. Put your finger over the left hand end of the tube.<br>
 Then bend down the right hand end.<br>
 What happens to the water level? [It goes down as you bend the tube.]<br>
 What happens to the water level in the left hand tube? [It does not change.]<br>
 Are the levels still the same? [No.]<br>
 Why not? [The finger in the left hand end blocked the tube so no air can 
get in or out.]<br>
 5. Go outside on a slope.<br>
 How you can find two places at the same level? [Use two rulers and the hose
or long plastic tube.]<br>
 B is five cm lower than A.<br>
 A is five cm higher than B.<br>
 [If the height of water in the tube is 10 cm at A and B, what is the difference 
in height at A and B? [The same height.]<br>
 If the height of water at A is 10 cm and at B is 15 cm, what is the height 
at A and B? [B is five cm lower than A.]<br>
 If the height of the water at A is 10 cm and at B is five cm, what is the 
height at A and B? [B is five cm higher than A.]<br>
 6. Using this tube, you can mark a horizontal line around a hill or along 
a slope.<br>
 This line is called a contour.<br>
 Mark a contour line along a slope.<br>
 7. Make contour banks to prevent soil erosion.<br>
 Mark a contour line along a slope or around a hill.<br>
 Dig a drain at the same depth along the contour line and use the soil to
make a contour bank on the down side.<br>
 Pour some water in the contour ditch.<br>
 It should not flow along, because the bottom of the ditch should be horizontal.<br>
 The water should just spread out.<br>
 Contour ditches and banks can stop soil being washed down by the rain.<br>
 You can stop soil erosion.<br>
 If the height of the stick at A is three metres and at B is 1. 5 m, how 
does the ground slope from B to A? [B is 1. 5 m above A.]<br>

 The site selected for a rain gauge should be level ground not near fences 
or trees.<br>
 Attach the bracket to a post about 1.5 metres above ground in a vertical 
 position.<br>
 Rainfall should be measured at 9.00 a.m. daily and the amount entered on
the rain chart against the date of the previous day.<br>
 To read the gauge, remove the plastic gauge from the bracket, take it to 
the chart, read the scale to the nearest millimetre (mm) and<br>
 record this on the chart, read the scale again and pour out the water.<br>
 Replace the scale in the bracket.<br>
 If you do not have a rain gauge, use a glass jar on a post.<br>
 Measure the depth of water in mm.<br>
 This reading in mm will not be the same as a proper rain gauge in mm.<br>
 Use a rain gauge or glass jar, rain chart on the wall (see over) or special 
rain recording book, ruled as in rain chart.<br>
 Each child must read the rain gauge.<br>
 1. Show the rain gauge or jar and ruler.<br>
 Show how to read the gauge with water in it:<br>
 1.1 Hold the top of the gauge vertically between thumb and first finger,<br>
 1.2 The level of water should be opposite the eye,<br>
 1.3 Keep their back straight and read level of water, to the nearest mm.<br>
 2. Read the gauge, but do not tell the children the reading.<br>
 Pass it from child to child.<br>
 Ask them to read the gauge and write down the reading.<br>
 When you have finished, ask each child to tell the class their readings.<br>
 3. Show the rain chart.<br>
 Show how to write in it.<br>
 4. Go outside to the rain gauge position.<br>
 Is it near trees or buildings? [No.]<br>
 Show how to read the rain gauge at 9.00 a.m. each day and record it on the
rain chart.<br>
 5. Draw up a roster of children to read the rain gauge each day, two children 
each day.<br>
 6. Ask the children if they have heard rainfall measurements announced 
on the radio.<br>
 If used properly, the rain gauge method is the same as that used by government 
officers who measure rain.<br>

 Teach the children to estimate wind speed and directions.<br>
 1. Explain that it is important to know the pattern of wind speed and direction
so people can predict the weather.<br>
 For example in January perhaps you can expect light to moderate winds coming
from the south or south-west.<br>
 This information helps us to understand the weather and is useful for aircraft
pilots and captains of ships.<br>
 2. Direction game:<br>
 Line the children facing north.<br>
 Hold your arms horizontally pointing your fingers.<br>
 Pretend this is the direction of the wind.<br>
 What is the direction of the wind? [Southerly.]<br>
 Turn around facing south and hold your arms up.<br>
 What direction is the wind? [North.]<br>
 Call out different wind directions.<br>
 The children have to point their arms in the wind direction.<br>
 East wind, point west, west wind, point east, south-west wind, point northwest, 
north west wind, point south east.<br>
 3. Wind Speed Game:<br>
 4. Describe the present wind speed and direction and record it on the chart.<br>
 Divide the class into pairs.<br>
 At 9.00 a.m. each day each pair has to record wind speed and directions.<br>
 5. What happens when a cyclone comes? [Strong wind in one direction, then 
calm, then strong wind in opposite direction.]<br>
 6. Beside the 9.00 a.m. reading observe wind speed and direction at 3.00 
p.m.<br>
 Is there a pattern of difference between the 9.00 a.m. and 3.00 p.m. observations?<br>
 For example, perhaps in January the afternoon winds are usually lighter 
 than the morning winds and swing from between S and SW<br>
 to between N and NE.<br>
 A similar observation and exercise should be done in your own area of the 
country.<br>
 7. Trade winds are winds that blow regularly in one direction, sometimes 
 for six months, and are used for trade by sailing vessels.<br>
 In the Northern hemisphere winds blow from the north east and in the Southern 
hemisphere winds blow from the south east, about 30<sup>o</sup><br>
 each side of the equator.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.24H"></a>5.24 Describe clouds<br>
<a href="../images/37.143.gif">See diagram 37.143</a>: Clouds, altocumulus, cumulus<br>
<a href="../images/37.135.gif">See diagram 37.135</a>: Cloud in a bottle<br>
<a href="../images/37.144.jpg">See diagram 37.144</a>: Stratocumulus<br>
 Teach the children to identify and describe different types of cloud and 
relate the children to rainfall.<br>
 Use a clean dry glass, clouds.<br>
 There are three main types of clouds, cumulus, stratus and cirrus.<br>
 1.1 Cumulus are the separate woolly clouds with sharp outlines.<br>
 Cumulus clouds join to form a big cloud with a flat dark base and bulging 
 upper part, like a cauliflower.<br>
 It may rise high in the sky and then spread out to form an anvil cloud.<br>
 This cloud has a dark base and makes lightning, thunder and heavy rain.<br>
 1.2 Stratus is a great misty mass of cloud.<br>
 It has no sharp outline. Therefore, stratus clouds have no shape.<br>
 Lots of cumulus clouds can join to make a stratus cloud.<br>
 1.3 When the wind blows over the sea then up over a mountain, a layer of
stratus cloud can form over the mountain.<br>
 This produces rain, mostly on the windward side of the mountain.<br>
 This can be called the weather coast.<br>
 1.4 Cirrus clouds are very high clouds and look like wisps of cotton wool 
or hairs.<br>
 Cirrus clouds do not bring rain.<br>
 1. Hold a clean dry glass upside down under a running tap to make it cold.<br>
 Breathe strongly into the glass.<br>
 Show the thin layer of water drops inside the glass that come from their 
breath, Explain that water is in the air, but you cannot see it.<br>
 2. Explain how air picks up water when it passes over the sea.<br>
 You cannot see the water in the air.<br>
 However, if the air rises it becomes small drops of water as you saw in 
the glass.<br>
 You see white cloud where sunlight bounces off the small water drops.<br>
 As the water drops grow larger they sink to the bottom of the cloud that 
then appears dark.<br>
 3. Draw the different shapes of cloud.<br>
 Use the side of the chalk to show the shapeless stratus.<br>
 4. Take the children outside.<br>
 What sort of cloud can they see?<br>
 Is it raining?<br>
 Can they see clouds near mountains?<br>
 Draw the clouds and the land.<br>
 5. Cloud watch: Record the clouds and rainfall every day for a week.<br>
 Can the children describe the clouds that bring rain?<br>
 Most thunderstorms occur from December to March in the afternoon over the
larger and more mountainous islands.<br>

 Teach the children to show that a push or pull is a force that can make 
an object start moving, stop moving or change direction.<br>
 Use a big box or pieces of wood with a string or rope attached, a pile 
of coins, a ruler, a pile of books, a catapult, glass of water,<br>

 This lesson should be based completely on the practical applications of 
force and movement.<br>
 Use the suggested instructional materials (and more) to vary demonstrations 
 for push and pull.<br>
 Give an example of force which:<br>
 1. Starts something moving,<br>
 2. Makes something go faster,<br>
 3. Makes something go slower,<br>
 4. Stops something,<br>
 5. Changes the direction of movement of something.<br>

<a href="../images/9.3.49.gif">See diagram 9.3.49</a>: Germination test<br>
 Teach the students to test the germination of seeds.<br>
 Use seed samples, wet newspaper, plate or saucer, water.<br>
 Not every seed will germinate, but instead of planting two or more seeds 
 in each hole use a germination test to estimate how many<br>
 seeds will germinate.<br>
 When seeds remain alive and can germinate to form baby plants, we say the
seeds are viable.<br>
 It is a good idea to test the viability of seeds before planting, otherwise 
 you waste time and effort on useless seeds.<br>
 To test the viability of small seeds, soak 20 seeds for an hour then put 
them on wet newspaper in a closed container.<br>
 After a few days count the number of seeds which produce healthy roots 
and calculate the percentage germination.<br>
 Groups of four students.<br>
 1. Give 20 seeds to each group of four students.<br>
 Show them how to soak the seeds first.<br>
 Then tell them how to do the germination test: you can use half coconut 
 shells for containers.<br>
 After four or five days count the number of germinated seeds and work out
the germination percentage.<br>
 2. If in the germination test on 20 seeds, 16 form roots, % germination
 = 16 / 20 x 100 = 80 %<br>
 If you plant 2000 seeds, how many will germinate? 2000 x 80 / 100 = 1600 
seeds<br>
 If you want 1000 plants to grow, how many seeds should you plant? Let N
= the number of seeds you should plant<br>
 80 / 100 x N = 1000<br>
 N = 1000 x 100 / 80 = 1 250 seeds<br>
 3. Compare there percentage germination of melon, corn and bean seeds<br>
 Are seeds alive? Do they breathe? [Yes, they are alive. They breathe very 
slowly.]<br>
 What are the four things that happen during germination? [1. Water enters 
the seed.<br>
 2. The seed becomes active.<br>
 3. The seed breathes more quickly.<br>
 4. A new plant starts to grow.]<br>
 What are the three stages of germination? [1. The seed swells and the radicle
grows out.<br>
 2. The stem grows into a loop the stem straightens. 3. The cotyledons and
leaves are pushed up out of the ground.]<br>

 Use maize (corn) and bean seeds and a prepared seed bed.<br>
 Although we call maize a "seed", in botany it is a "fruit"!<br>
 The best planting depth is usually 2.0 cm in wet soil and 4.0 cm in dry 
soil.<br>

 Use maize grain, rice or sorghum, jar, wet paper, knife, magnifying glasses.<br>
 The seed of maize, rice and sorghum is really a fruit with a hard tight 
 wall.<br>
 It is called a grain.<br>
 In England "corn" means wheat.<br>
 In USA "corn" means maize, i.e. Indian corn.<br>
 Use maize grain soaked in water for a few days, knife and magnifying glasses.<br>
 About one week before the lesson plant some soaked maize grains.<br>
 A shoot is the stem and the leaves.<br>
 Learn to cut soaked grains longitudinally and transversely with a knife.<br>
 Be Careful!<br>
 1. Show the dry maize grains and soaked maize grains.<br>
 What is the difference? [Soaked maize grains are softer and fatter.]<br>
 2. Look at the germinating grain.<br>
 Can you see the first root? The white shoot cap? The first leaves breaking 
 through the shoot cap?<br>
 3. Cut a soaked maize grain in longitudinal half.<br>
 Can you see its parts? When there is enough water, air and warmth, the new
plant will start to grow.<br>
 This is called germination.<br>
 When all this stored food has been used up, the plant will make its own 
food in its leaves.<br>

 Teach the children to show that plants take in water.<br>
 Use small plants such as Amaranths, glass jars, ink, cooking oil, water.<br>
 In this lesson you can show that plants take up water in two ways: see whether
the ink gets into the plant.<br>
 Put the plants in the inky<br>
 1. Give out plants and inky water.<br>
 Can the plants take in water? How can you show this? [Put plants in inky 
water and water.<br>
 Remove them out after a few hours.]<br>
 2. How you can see how much water plants take in? [Put some oil on the water, 
then the water cannot evaporate.]<br>
 Draw the diagram.<br>
 How will you know that the water went into the plant and nowhere else? 
[The inky water will show us where the plant went.]<br>
 Set up the demonstration and put it aside.<br>
 3. Give out small plants with well washed roots, and magnifying glasses. 
 Can they see the tiny root hairs?<br>
 Take the plant out of the inky water. Break open the stem.<br>
 Can they see the ink inside? What can you learn from this? [Roots take 
in water.]<br>
 Look at the water with the oil in top.<br>
 Is the water level the same? [No, it has gone down.]<br>
 Why did it go down? [Some water went into the plant.]<br>
 Look at the control.<br>
 Did the water level go down? [No.]<br>
 Why not? [There was no plant to take in the water.]<br>
 4. Put some ink in water then put the plant roots in it.<br>
 After a few hours break open the stem with their thumb nails and they will
see the ink in the stem<br>
 5. Put the plant in water and add about one cm thick of cooking oil.<br>
 Mark the level of the water.<br>
 After about one day the level of the water drops.<br>
 If you have another jar with oil floating on it, you will notice that the
water level in this jar has not dropped.<br>
 This is called a control.<br>
 It shows that the water level dropped, because the plant absorbed it.<br>
 If you look at the roots of a small plant, you can see what it uses to take
in water.<br>
 It takes in water through the root hairs.<br>

 Teach the children to show that plant leaves give out water.<br>
 Use plastic bags, string, small tree with soft green leaves.<br>
 Plants take water from the soil into their roots through root hairs.<br>
 From there, water moves up the stem through to the leaves.<br>
 1. You will do an experiment to see what happens when a plastic bag is tied
over leaves.<br>
 2. Show a dry plastic bag, and a tree branch with dry green leaves.<br>

 3. How can you prove that water comes from the leaves and not the stem? 
 [Tie the plastic bag around the stem, the leaves pulled off.<br>
 No water will form in the bag.]<br>
 Draw a plant then draw arrows on it to show how water moves through it.<br>
 Write labels on the arrows.<br>
 [Soil water, root hairs, stem, leaves, air.]<br>
 Plants take water from the soil into their roots through their tiny root 
hairs.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.32H"></a> 5.32 Protect mangroves<br>
 Teach the children to explain why we should keep mangroves growing.<br>
 Use pictures of specimens of mangroves or a natural mangrove environment
 close to the school.<br>
 Either prepare to visit mangroves or have some pictures of typical mangroves.<br>
 It is preferable to have both, for a lasting impression.<br>
 Mangroves are big trees that can live in the shallow sea water near the 
shore.<br>
 Their roots grow in the mud or sand and are under water at high tide.<br>
 Some people want to cut down the mangroves to use the wood or to get rid 
of mosquitoes or to clean trees from the shore.<br>
 Some people do not like mangrove swamps, because they cannot walk through 
 them easily.<br>
 Why should you keep mangroves?<br>
 1. They are very interesting plants.<br>
 Many years ago they lived in the forest, but they learned to live in shallow 
sea water and they developed special parts to do this.<br>
 Some mangroves have roots that grow up through the mud to get air.<br>
 Some mangroves have tall stilt roots for holding onto rocky land.<br>
 Some mangrove seeds grow into small plants still attached to the tree, 
others seeds form a long root to spear into the mud when it falls.<br>
 Can they see anything else that is special about mangroves?<br>
 2. Mangroves hold the mud together and can make new land.<br>
 If we kill all the mangroves, the mud will be washed into the sea.<br>
 Many animals live in the mud and are part of the food chain.<br>
 Many small fish live among the mangroves where they can hide.<br>
 When these fish grow bigger, they swim into the sea.<br>
 3. When mangrove leaves die they fall directly into the sea.<br>
 These leaves act as a fertilizer.<br>
 4. Mangroves have been part of the scenery of the country for a long time.<br>
 We should not destroy your natural environment, but keep it for the next 
generation to enjoy and learn from.<br>
 5. Visit a mangrove swamp.<br>
 How many different kinds of animals can they find living in the mangrove 
 trees and in the mud? Dig a deep hole in the mud.<br>
 Can they smell a gas produced by anaerobic bacteria living in the airless 
 mud? [Hydrogen sulfide.]<br>
 Can you recognize Red Mangrove (<i>Rhizophora</i>) which possesses silt 
roots for absorption from the muddy surface?<br>
 Which of them possesses breathing roots to keep the plant well aerated? 
 [White mangrove, <i>Avicennia</i>.]<br>
 Taste the leaves of the two plants.<br>
 Which of them tastes more salty? [<i>Avicennia</i> leaves, because they 
have salt glands on the upper leaf.<br>
 The lenticels are concentrated on the upper part of the breathing roots 
 or pneumatophores.]<br>

 Teach the children to describe different rocks, make up groups of rocks 
 with the same property, and put a new rock<br>
 in one of those groups.<br>
 Prepare a simple rock classification the week before this lesson, collect 
 enough rocks so that each group of<br>
 children has the same kinds of rocks.<br>
 You can break a big rock into pieces by wrapping it in a cloth then hitting 
it with a hammer.<br>
 Use the following pieces:<br>
 1. rounded stones from rivers,<br>
 2. pieces of gravel,<br>
 3. pieces of stone showing layers,<br>
 4. pieces of stone showing crystals,<br>
 5. stone that makes a mark when rubbed on paper (we call this "streak").<br>
 You will also need paper, nails and a magnifying glass for each group.<br>
 Divide the class into groups of four children.<br>
 1. Give each group one of each kind of stone (a) to (e), and a magnifying 
 glass.<br>
 Is the stone hard or soft?<br>
 Can you break it into pieces?'<br>
 Can you scratch it with a nail?<br>
 What colour is the stone?<br>
 Is the stone made of layers?<br>
 Is the stone shiny or dull? [It may contain shiny crystals.]<br>
 Does the stone feel smooth or rough?<br>
 Rub the stone on a piece of paper.<br>
 What colour does it make on the paper?<br>
 2. Stone Sculptures<br>
 Show the children how to rub or cut soft stone into different shapes.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Teach the children to make a collection of the different
types of rocks near the school.<br>
 Use rock types from different locations, boxes for the rocks, a hammer 
and a magnifying glasses.<br>
 Before the lesson collect different types or rocks from your area.<br>
 Include rocks from cliff faces, streams, and the sea shore.<br>
 Also, tell the children to bring rocks from home.<br>
 1. The three main types of rocks are as follows:<br>
 1.1 Igneous rocks are formed from volcanoes.<br>
 The rocks have cooled from very hot liquid rock.<br>
 You can see whole crystals in them.<br>
 1.2 Sedimentary rocks are formed form particles of other rocks carried 
into rivers, lakes and the sea and then squeezed together.<br>
 You can usually see the layers in the rock.<br>
 Coral reef limestone are also classified as sedimentary rocks.<br>
 1.3 Metamorphic rocks were once igneous or sedimentary rocks, but have been
squeezed and heated again.<br>
 Do you know where the main rocks are found and their uses in your country? 
<br>
 2. Show the collection of rocks.<br>
 Divide the rocks into those obtained from:<br>
 2.1 rivers, rounded pebbles, pieces from the edge of the river,<br>
 2.2 Sea shore, pieces of limestone, rounded stones,<br>
 2.3 Deep in the soil,<br>
 2.4 Cliff faces, pieces of rock.<br>
 3. Wash the stones.<br>
 Divide the children into two groups:<br>
 3.1 Stones have crystals, they shine when you turn the rock.<br>
 These are igneous rocks from volcanoes.<br>
 3.2 Stones do not have crystals, usually have layers.<br>
 These are sedimentary rocks formed at the bottom of lakes and the sea.<br>
 4. Look at the igneous rocks.<br>
 Are the crystals darker or lighter than the rest of the rock?<br>
 How big are the crystals?<br>
 5. Look at the sedimentary rocks.<br>
 Can you see the layers?<br>
 Are all the particles the same size?<br>
 How big are the particles?<br>
 6. The sedimentary rock limestone may contain shells.<br>
 If you put some acid on limestone, it forms bubbles of carbon dioxide gas.<br>
 7. Make a display of their rock collection.<br>
 Label it:<br>
 igneous, where found, description of crystals, colours, layers.<br>
 metamorphic, where found, description of crystals, colours, layers.<br>
 sedimentary, where found, description of crystals, colours, layers.<br>
 8. Name the rocks you find:<br>
 Basalt: Heavy, dark rock, with very small crystals, some have green colour<br>
 Andesite: Light coloured, with very small crystals<br>
 Limestone: Looks dirty, no layers, fizzes in acid<br>
 Mudstone: Sedimentary with fine particles, layered, easily broken<br>
 Sandstone: Sedimentary, separate sand grains can be seen<br>
 Conglomerate: Sedimentary, has mixture of rounded stones and smaller particles.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="1.32H"></a>1.32 Different rocks<br>
 Teach the children to describe different rocks, make up groups of rocks 
 with the same property, and put new rocks in a group.<br>
 Use the following:<br>
 1.1 rounded stones from rivers,<br>
 1.2 pieces of gravel that are small stones with sharp edges often used 
to make roads,<br>
 1.3 pieces of stone showing layers,<br>
 1.4 pieces of stone showing crystals,<br>
 1.5 stone that makes a mark when rubbed on paper, called "streak".<br>
 You will also need paper, nails and a magnifier for each group.<br>
 You will need enough rocks so that each group of children has the same 
kinds of rocks.<br>
 Break a big rock into pieces by wrapping it in a cloth then hitting it with
a hammer.<br>
 1. Give each group each kind of stone 1.1 to 1.5. and a magnifier.<br>
 Is the stone hard or soft?<br>
 Can you break it into pieces?<br>
 Can you scratch it with a nail?<br>
 What colour is the stone?<br>
 Is the stone made of layers?<br>
 Is the stone shiny or dull? [It may contain shiny crystals.]<br>
 Does the stone feel smooth or rough?<br>
 Rub the stone on a piece of paper.<br>
 What colour does it make on the paper?<br>
 2. Stone Sculptures<br>
 Show how to rub or cut soft stone into different shapes.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.34H"></a>5.34 Soil profiles<br>
<a href="../images/6.26.gif">See diagram: 6.26</a>: Soil profiles<br>
 Teach the children to collect samples of different kinds of soils and what
you see in them.<br>
 1. Use a sharp spade to dig the soil profiles and glass jars or pieces 
of glass.<br>
 To dig a soil profile, find a flat area free of stones.<br>
 Dig down vertically on three sides of a square.<br>
 Dig the fourth side on a slope to make a wedge, then lift up the soil.<br>
 The top few centimetres of soil are dark in colour, because rotten plants 
 and animals form a black sticky substance called humus.<br>
 The topsoil is a layer containing the humus and most of the plant roots.<br>
 Below it is the subsoil that contains mostly sand, stones and clay and some
big tap roots.<br>
 Below that is solid rock.<br>
 The subsoil and topsoil may have formed from these rocks or the soil may 
have been dumped on the rocks by a river or water washing down.<br>
 2. Record how many kinds of soil profiles you can collect:<br>
 2.1 Loam soil is a good garden soil found in river valleys.<br>
 It may be black or red with much humus in the topsoil.<br>
 Soil from a hill will have less topsoil than soil from a river valley.<br>
 2.2 Sandy soil is found just behind a beach or near the bend in a running 
 river.<br>
 It does not have much humus and dries out easily.<br>
 2.3 Clay soil is hard to dig in dry weather and very sticky in wet weather.<br>
 It takes a long time to dry out and when it does it forms cracks. It usually 
has a red to brown colour.<br>
 2.4 Mangrove soils and poorly drained soils have a grey colour and often 
a funny smell.<br>
 3. Show the children how to dig a soil profile.<br>
 4. Collect different soil profiles.<br>
 Measure the depth of topsoil and subsoil, note the colours and record where
it was found.<br>
 5. Describe where different kinds of soil are found and why they are found 
there.<br>
 What kinds of plants are growing on them Are soils good for gardens<br>
 6. Dig soil profiles in a new garden, old garden, in a forest and on a steep
slope.<br>
 What differences do you see? Make a table and record your observations.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.36H"></a>5.36 Cover crops<br>
<a href="../images/6.65.4.gif">See diagram 6.65.4</a>: Cover crops, Centro, Siratro, Puero<br>
 Teach the children to name which plants are suitable for cover crops or 
green manure and explain how they improve the soil.<br>
 Use specimens of common plants used for cover crops and green manure or 
diagrams of the different plants.<br>
 Ask an agricultural officer to show you how to prepare these seeds or cuttings
for planting.<br>
 1. Draw a diagram of a bed of soil on the chalkboard.<br>
 Hold your arm above the diagram.<br>
 What would my arm protect the soil from? [Sunlight, rain.]<br>
 Why should we protect the soil from sunlight? [If the soil is too hot, 
if seeds cannot germinate, if water is lost from the soil.]<br>
 Why should you protect soil from rain? [Heavy raindrops make the soil splash
up then get washed away.]<br>
 2. What can you use to protect the soil?<br>
 Can you use sheets of iron? [No.]<br>
 Can you use trees? [Yes, but when the trees grow big they will use most 
of the light and water so you can't grow other crops.]<br>
 You use plants that do not grow high, but cover all the ground with lots 
of leaves, e.g. legumes called Puero, Centro and Calopogonium.<br>
 3. A legume cover crop can:<br>
 3.1. Lower soil temperature and evaporation of water,<br>
 3.2 Protect soil from splash erosion, but let water trickle down into the
soil<br>
 3.3. Shade the weeds so they cannot grow,<br>
 3.4 Add humus and nitrogen fertilizer to the soil when the leaves die.<br>
 4. If you are not using land for some time, e.g. during the school holidays, 
protect the soil and keep weeds out by planting a cover<br>
 crop.<br>
 However, clearing plants is hard work.<br>
 If you plant an upright legume such as cow pea or mung bean, you can easily 
dig them into the soil.<br>
 This is called green manure.<br>
 About 3-6 weeks after digging, the plants rot in the soil and the plant 
 foods will be available for their next crop.<br>
 5. Show the legume plants and let the children feel the soil under a cover 
crop.<br>
 6. Sowing a of green manure.<br>
 Note that Centro has hard seeds that take a long time to germinate unless 
you treat them with boiling water.<br>
 Puero and Calopogonium grow well in shade under leaves.<br>
 You cannot dig in green manure crops under tree crops, because it would 
damage the roots.<br>
 Other good legumes are Hetero and Siratro that produce good grains for cattle
and Stylo that is good at smothering weeds.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.37H"></a>5.37 Rain on slopes<br>
<a href="../images/24.4.6.png">See diagram: 24.4.6</a>: Rain on slopes<br>
 Teach the children to describe what happens when water falls on different 
 slopes.<br>
 Use:<br>
 1. One to four jam tins with holes punched in the bottom,<br>
 2. A soil ridge that is flat on top, has one side sloping steeply and the
other side sloping gradually<br>
 Teach this lesson outside in the garden.<br>
 1. Show to how to make two ridges that are flat on top.<br>
 One ridge has steep sides and the other has gradual sloping sides.<br>
 Leave no plants or stones on the ridge, only fine soil.<br>
 2. Give each group a tin with holes in the bottom.<br>
 Show how to fill the tin with water and make artificial rain.<br>
 3. Make rain on the gradual slope.<br>
 Tell the children what happens. [Some water just soaks into the soil, some
water runs down the slope and carries soil down.]<br>
 4. Make rain on the steep slope.<br>
 Explain what happens.<br>
 [Much soil is carried down the slopes.]<br>
 5 .Where should you make gardens? [On flat ground or else the soil will 
be washed away.]<br>
 6. Do the same, but cover the soil with grass.<br>
 Grass stops the soil from being carried away.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.39H"></a> 5.39 Make clay pots<br>
 Teach the children to make a pot from sand and clay.<br>
 Use fresh sand and different types of clay, banana fibre, round stones, 
 fuel wood.<br>
 About a week before the lesson, collect the same amount of red clay and 
washed sand.<br>
 Mix them in equal parts by pounding with a wide stick.<br>
 Wrap it in banana leaves to keep it moist.<br>
 1. Explain that this method of making pots is very old and is still is in
some parts of the world.<br>
 2. Give each group a lump of damp clay.<br>
 Divide it into four smaller pieces.<br>
 Flatten each lump with a round stone.<br>
 3. Twist the banana fibre to make a hoop for a stand.<br>
 4. Mould one piece over a stone to make the bowl shape.<br>
 Put this on the hoop.<br>
 Add flat pieces to build up the walls, keeping the stone inside.<br>
 Cut the lip smooth with a coconut fibre and smooth the edge with wet fingers, 
take the stone out.<br>
 Write your name in the side with a small stick.<br>
 5. Leave the pot to dry for 1-4 weeks.<br>
 6. Firing the pot: Get lots of little softwood sticks.<br>
 Put the pot on top of some, then build a house of sticks all around the 
pot.<br>
 Set fire to the house of sticks.<br>
 Encourage the children to visit different locations where pots are made 
from clay.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.41H"></a>5.41 Keep water clean<br>
 Teach the children to explain how to keep water clean for humans, animals 
 and plants.<br>
 Use sample of pure drinking and polluted water, examples of purifying processes.<br>
 Before the lesson visit a local source of drinking water or a river and 
the seashore.<br>
 Note where the water is clean.<br>
 Use samples of good drinking water and smelly polluted water that is unfit 
for drinking.<br>
 Bring some rubbish found in a river or on the seashore.<br>
 1. Show the good samples of good drinking water and water unfit for drinking.<br>
 Tell them to look at the samples, smell them and tell you the difference.<br>
 Why do you need clean water? [Dirty water can make us sick.]<br>
 Explain that dirty water can contain bacteria that make us sick.<br>
 Bacteria are so small that you cannot see them with your naked eyes.<br>
 You need a microscope to see them.<br>
 2. How can you be sure that water is clean and will not make us sick?<br>
 2.1. Boil water for babies.<br>
 2.2. Drink rainwater.<br>
 2.3. Drink clean water from wells or rivers.<br>
 2.4. Drink clean water from treated sources.<br>
 3. How you can you make clean water dirty:<br>
 3.1 Throwing rubbish or dead animals in the river.<br>
 3.2 People putting their faeces or urine in the river.<br>
 Toilets must be 20 metres from the river otherwise bacteria from sick people
can get into the water.<br>
 3.3 Chemicals such as insecticides and weedicides can wash into the river 
from sprayed crops.<br>
 Soil can wash into the river to make it muddy.<br>
 4. How you can keep rivers clean:<br>
 4.1 Bury all rubbish.<br>
 4.2 Build toilets at least 20 m from the river and at least one metre deep.<br>
 4.3 Do not let agricultural chemicals wash into rivers.<br>
 Bury unused chemicals.<br>
 4.4 Use contour banks to stop soil washing into rivers.<br>
 4.5 Do plants and animals in the rivers and sea need clean water? [Yes.]<br>
 How can dirty water hurt them? Disease and chemicals can kill them.<br>
 Muddy water and rubbish stop them getting light.<br>
 Muddy water can kill coral.<br>
 Plastic rubbish can kill some fish if they eat it.<br>
 5.1 Visit a pig latrine.<br>
 Is it 20 metres from a river, houses, pig yards, wells?<br>
 Is it more than one metre deep?<br>
 Does it have a cover?<br>
 re there any flies around it?<br>
 5.2 Visit a river.<br>
 Is there any rubbish in it?<br>
 Is muddy water caused by garden soil washing into it?<br>
 an chemicals get into it?<br>
 5.3 Visit the seashore.<br>
 Is the water muddy?<br>
 Can animals and plants live in the muddy water?<br>
 Collect the flotsam washed up on the beach.<br>
 How did it get there?<br>
 Does it contain plastics?<br>
 Plastics do not rot quickly and remain rubbish for a long time.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.42H"></a>5.42 Heated air expands<br>
<a href="../images/20.1.1.gif">See diagram 20.1.1 </a>: Heated air expands<br>
 Teach the children to describe what happens when a bottle is heated and 
then cooled.<br>
 Explain that air expands when heated and contracts when cooled?<br>
 Use a bottle, plastic tube from ball pen, burner, glass jar.<br>
<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Be careful! This experiment is dangerous 
 if you heat the bottle too much.</span><br>
 Before the lesson, practice the demonstration in a preparation room before 
doing it in front of children.<br>
 Strict adherence to instructions is very essential here if accidents are 
to be avoided.<br>
 Demonstration preferred<br>
 1. Give out the materials and tell the children to push the ball pen tube 
into the hole in the cork.<br>
 Push the cork into the mouth of the bottle, so that no air can leak out
around the side of the cork,<br>
 Hold the neck of the bottle with a piece of rag or paper and tip the bottle 
so that the end of the tube is about three cm under the level<br>
 of the water in the tin.<br>
 Heat the bottle gently with the burner for a few minutes and watch what 
happens. [Bubbles come out of the tube in the water.]<br>
 2. Stop heating the bottle.<br>
 Put out the burner flame.<br>
 Keep the end of the tube under the water and watch what happens as the bottle
cools down.<br>
 [Water is sucked into the tube.]<br>
 3. Explain why it is dangerous to heat closed bottles or gas cylinders 
because when gases are heated they expand.<br>
 If expansion occurs very quickly this is called an explosion.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.43H"></a>5.43 Burn to make carbon<br>
<a href="../images/3.1.2.4ch.gif">See diagram 3.1.2.4</a>: Bunsen burner flame, Candle flame<br>
 Teach the children to show that all living things contain carbon.<br>
 Use a candle or burner, old torch battery from a radio, paper, pencil, 
dry leaves, insects, sugar, food, tin lids, iron nails, tongs or a<br>
 holder to hold nails in the fire.<br>
 In this lesson you will burn a variety of materials that are alive or were
once alive and in each case you will show that when the burning<br>
 is completed only carbon is left.<br>
 Carbon is an element represented by the symbol C.<br>
 Oxygen is represented with O.<br>
 If carbon is heated to a very high temperature, it can form the gas carbon 
dioxide or CO.<br>
 So if you heat the substances in this experiment to high temperatures you
would not have any carbon left, it would all have turned into<br>
 carbon dioxide gas.<br>
 Break open the battery and take out the black rod in the middle.<br>
 Dig a hole outside where there is good topsoil containing plenty of black 
humus.<br>
 1. Give out the candle or burner, tongs and things to be burned.<br>
 Hold a tin lid in the candle flame.<br>
 Cool the lid then wipe off the black stuff called soot.<br>
 Explain that this black stuff is called carbon.<br>
 Put some carbon on your fingers.<br>
 2. Make a pencil mark on paper then rub your finger on it.<br>
 The black mark on your finger is carbon.<br>
 3. Show the black rod in the centre of the battery.<br>
 It is carbon.<br>
 4. Burn paper, an insect, piece of meat or sweet potato.<br>
 What happens to them? [They become black.]<br>
 What is the black stuff? [Carbon.]<br>
 5. Heat up some sugar on a tin lid.<br>
 What happens to the sugar? [It burns to form carbon.]<br>
 6. Take the children outside to the hole.<br>
 How is the topsoil different from the subsoil? [It is darker.]<br>
 What is in the topsoil? [Rotten plants and animals.]<br>
 Why is it black? [The rotten plants and animals become carbon.]<br>
 Explain that the substance from rotten plants and animals that contain 
carbon is called humus.<br>
 7. Take a piece of burnt wood, it is called charcoal.<br>
 Heat it until it glows red.<br>
 Why does it get smaller? [The carbon is changed into carbon dioxide gas.]<br>
 Relate this to what happens in a charcoal pressing iron and when used for
cooking locally.<br>
 8. Burn some feathers or hair.<br>
 Carbon is formed, but there is also a strong small.<br>
 The smell comes from another substance called sulfur S, which burns to form
the gas sulfur dioxide, SO2<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.44H"></a>5.44 Soil fertilizer trial<br>
<a href="../images/5.44.gif">See diagram 5.44</a>: Fertilizer trial<br>
 Teach the children to set up a fertilizer trial to test whether fertilizer 
 makes crops grow better.<br>
 Use a piece of land already dug, wooden pegs, maize seeds or pineapple
 suckers or other planting material.<br>
 Ask an agricultural officer for advice on which fertilizer to use for a
trial.<br>
 The plant nutrients are divided into the following three classes:<br>
 1. Primary plant nutrients, nitrogen N, phosphorus P, and potassium K.<br>
 (Potash is potassium oxide).<br>
 One or more of these usually limits the yield of a crop i.e. if there were
more of this plant nutrient in the soil the yield would be greater.<br>
 These are the most important plant nutrients, which make from 2-6 % of the
dry weight of plants.<br>
 2. Secondary plant nutrients, sulfur S, iron Fe, calcium Ca and Magnesium 
 Mg.<br>
 These nutrients are needed in smaller amounts than the primary plant nutrients 
for normal growth.<br>
 There is usually enough of these in the soil for good crop yields.<br>
 3. Micronutrients (sometimes called trace elements] include:<br>
 boron B, chlorine Cl, cobalt Co, copper Cu, manganese Mn, molybdenum Mo 
and zinc Zn.<br>
 These are needed in very tiny amounts for the normal growth of some plants.<br>
 If a soil does not have enough of a particular plant nutrient, e.g. nitrogen, 
we say that the soil is deficient in nitrogen.<br>
 The only sure way to find out whether a soil is deficient in any plant 
nutrients is to ask a field officer of the Department of Agriculture<br>
 to send some of the soil to a laboratory for chemical testing.<br>
 However, we can tell if the soil is deficient in plant nutrients by examining 
our crop plants carefully.<br>
 If a plant does not look healthy, because there is not enough plant nutrient 
we say that it shows deficiency symptoms.<br>
 When there is not enough, the plant shows plant nutrient deficiency symptoms:<br>
 4. Nitrogen deficiency: The plants are small and you have few leaves which 
are pale green or yellow.<br>
 The lower leaves look burnt and die early.<br>
 5. Phosphorus deficiency<br>
 The plants are small and do not grow well.<br>
 The leaves are a blue-green colour and are usually purple underneath.<br>
 The lower leaves die early.<br>
 They take a long time to produce fruit which are small and badly shaped.<br>
 6. Potassium (potash) deficiency<br>
 The plants have small main shoots, but many side shoots.<br>
 The leaves have dead white areas on the leaf edges and later die.<br>
 7. sulfur deficiency<br>
 The plants are small with pale green upper leaves.<br>
 8. Calcium deficiency<br>
 The plants are small with unusually shaped leaves.<br>
 The shoot tips may die.<br>
 9. Magnesium deficiency<br>
 The leaves have green veins, but are pale yellow in between.<br>
 10. Iron deficiency<br>
 The younger leaves look yellow.<br>
 The lack of healthy green colour in the leaves is called chlorosis and this
may be due to a deficiency in one or more plant nutrients.<br>
 11. A fertilizer trial is designed to try out different kinds of fertilizer 
 in different amounts to see if fertilizer makes crops grow better.<br>
 12. Show the children how to mark out with wooden pegs the corners A. B.
C. D and the mid points I, II, III, IV.<br>
 The rows should all be the same size.<br>
 The seeds or cuttings should be all planted the same distance apart in the
rows.<br>
 3. Fertilizer is applied to the experiment plots A and D.<br>
 No fertilizer is applied to plots B and C called control.<br>
 4. Draw the trial in an exercise book, write down the date.<br>
 5. Compare the crops in A and D with plots B and C plots.<br>
 Does the fertilizer improve the crop yield?<br>
 6. Set up a long trial using tree crops.<br>
