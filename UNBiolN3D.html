Datura species are called angel's trumpets, as are other Solanaceae species.<br>
22/12/2022: Australian broadcasting Corporation, "Thornapple", (edited for this website)<br>
About 200 Australians have been reported being poisoned this week as a result of eating contaminated spinach.<br>
The contamination was traced back to the noxious weed thornapple, also known as jimsonweed, a poisonous invasive species that is found across Australia.<br>
Thornapple, (Datura stramonium), jimsonweed, devil's snare, devil's trumpet, Solanaceae, a family of plants, which includes both highly toxic plants such as nightshade and belladonna and kitchen staples like tomatoes and potatoes.<br>
It is a leafy annual herb, grows to 60 cm in height, oval or broadly triangular-shaped flowers with jagged edges, white flowers, from Central America, was introduced in Australia as a garden plant and once used as a treatment for mania and epilepsy.<br>
Every part of the thornapple plant is toxic to both humans and animals.<br>
Children in particular are very sensitive to thornapple poisoning, with common symptoms including: thirst dilated pupils, high temperatures, weak or rapid pulse, incoherence or hallucinations, vomiting, breathing problems, convulsions.<br>
Touching the plant can also cause dermatitis, nausea and headaches in some people.
Every part of the thornapple plant is poisonous, with the seeds particularly high in toxins.<br>
In agricultural lands it competes with summer crops and spreads by seed,<br>
A spinach producer has confirmed that thornapple had been found in its "baby spinach" products.<br>
Thornapple in gardens can be removed physically with hand weeding, or chemically with herbicide.<br>
