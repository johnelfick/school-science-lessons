 See: <a href="./commercial/Commercial.html#FoodH">Food</a> food chain, food web, (Commercial)<br>
<a href="./images/9.311.gif">See diagram 9.311</a>: Food chain animals.<br>
 In this lesson introduce the idea of food chains in the forest and start 
 them on observing small animals in plastic cages as shown in the<br>
 figure below.<br>
 The importance of the food chain is that it teaches children that living
 things depend on each other.<br>
 The sign --> means "is eaten by" and shows the direction of flow.<br>
 Teach the children to study animals in the forest and discover food chains.<br>
 Examples of food chains:<br>
 1. leaf --> butterfly --> larva --> lizard<br>
 2. Kangaroo grass --> grasshopper --> birds --> round worm
parasite<br>
 3. Palm beetle --> scorpion --> spider --> bird<br>
 4. Dead <i>Casuarina</i> --> fungus --> wood louse --> ant<br>
 5. Rotten leaf --> millipede --> toad --> snake -->
 dog<br>
 Before the lesson, prepare plastic cages.<br>
 Use a plastic drink bottle.<br>
 Groups of four<br>
 1. Explain the food chains using arrows.<br>
 Think of some food chains.<br>
 Use animals in the forest.<br>
 2. In the forest telling what eats what is not easy, especially if they 
 are small animals.<br>
 To enable us to do this you will collect animals and plants from the floor
of the forest and study them in plastic cages.<br>
 3. Take the children into the forest to collect animals for their cages.<br>
 Can you see something eating something else?<br>
 You will need to put different animals together to see what happens to them.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="6.2H"></a>6.02 Protect turtles<br>
<a href="./images/9.307.gif">See diagram 9.307</a>: Turtle.<br>
 Turtles and crocodiles are reptiles.<br>
 They have a thick skin with scales and lay their eggs on land.<br>
 In this lesson the teacher should explain that they are interesting animals, 
which are part of their natural heritage.<br>
 If you killed them with the aid of modern weapons, something that you all
own would be lost.<br>
 There may be a good reason for killing some animals for traditional purposes.<br>
 Most people are frightened of crocodiles, but we should not kill them, just
keep away from them.<br>
 Both crocodiles and turtles are part of the food chain.<br>
 In some countries crocodiles are kept in farms for their skins.<br>
 Crocodiles live in the Laurie Lagoon on Guadalcanal and on the Olu and 
Malau Islands.<br>
 We should respect all creatures and let them survive for future generations
 to study and admire these beautiful creatures.<br>
 Collect pictures of turtles and crocodiles.<br>
 Some of these animals are on postage stamps: Green Turtle, Pacific Ridley 
 Turtle, Loggerhead Turtle, Leatherback Turtle, Estuarine<br>
 Crocodile.<br>
 Hawks Bill turtles live near the shore and are easily caught.<br>
 We seldom eat them, but some people kill them to use the shell to make things
sold to tourists.<br>
 Leatherback turtles are very big and can swim great distances in the open
ocean.<br>
 They are a very old kind of turtle and do not have a bony back shell.<br>
 They are rare, because people eat their eggs when the mother lays them on
the land.<br>
 Green turtle, Pacific Ridley turtles and Loggerhead turtles are becoming 
 fewer, because so many people like to eat them.<br>
 They catch the mother turtles when they swim to a beach to lay their eggs.<br>
 In the past people killed only a few turtles for traditional use, but now
many people use motorboats to catch them and do not respect<br>
 the old customs.<br>
 Also large fishing boats from other countries drown turtles when they get
caught up in fishing nets.<br>
 Turtles cannot lay eggs until they are more than 10 years old.<br>
 So protecting them now is important or there will be no turtles left for
us to watch or eat.<br>
 1. Show the pictures of turtles.<br>
 Ask them if they have seen turtles.<br>
 What they think about them, should you kill them? Why people kill them.<br>
 2. Explain why we should NOT kill them<br>
 We must respect all animals.<br>
 Animals should not become extinct.<br>
 Animals are part of our natural heritage.<br>
 Turtles are beautiful creatures that should be admired.<br>
 3. Explain why they are in danger of animals becoming extinct:<br>
 The custom of killing for special occasions or to honour special people.<br>
 However, some customs are no longer respected.<br>
 People now have motor boats.<br>
 Foreign fishing boats drown the turtles when they are caught in nets.<br>
 4. Explain how they can protect turtles:<br>
 Protect eggs and hatched baby turtles,<br>
 Protect laying mothers,<br>
 Protect turtles at sea.<br>
 5. Turtle sightings.<br>
 Encourage the children to report whenever they see these animals.<br>
 Give a small reward for each sighting.<br>
 What can children do?<br>
 Do not disturb turtle nests and eggs, let the baby turtles hatch out and
get into the sea.<br>
 Do not catch a turtle when it is moving up the beach to lay eggs.<br>
 If you see a turtle on a beach, keep it a secret, do not tell everybody, 
 or bad people will kill her before she can lay her eggs.<br>
 If you are out in a canoe and see a turtle, do not kill it.<br>
 Teach the children to explain why we should protect turtles and crocodiles.<br>
 Tell the teacher where you saw the turtle and what kind it is, then the 
teacher will give you a prize!<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="6.3H"></a>6.03 Chicken life cycle (Primary)<br>
<a href="./images/50.6.2.gif">See diagram 50.6.2</a>: Chicken life cycle.<br>
<a href="./images/50.6.0.gif">See diagram: 50.6.0</a>: Parts of a chicken.<br>
 Objective: To explain how the mother hen can make baby chickens.<br>
 Discuss the diagram for this lesson with the head teacher before teaching 
 this lesson.<br>
 1. Where do baby chickens come from? [Eggs.]<br>
 Where do the eggs come from? [The mother hen lays them.]<br>
 What does a hen need to make a baby chicken? [She must mate with a rooster
 that will put sperm inside her to fertilize her egg.]<br>
 Then she puts a shell around the egg and lays it.<br>
 2. Show the children the diagrams and read the explanations.<br>
 Most fish and all frogs do not look after their young, but chickens always
 look after their young.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="6.8H"></a>6.08 Heated liquids expand<br>
<a href="./images/20.1.2.gif">See diagram 20.1.2</a>: Heat conical flask.<br>
<a href="./images/20.1.3.gif">See diagram 20.1.3</a>: Heat with hands.<br>
 Teach the children to describe how water expands when heated.<br>
 Use a bottle, plastic tube from a ball pen, burners, heating stand, ink 
to colour the water, cork with a hole through it.<br>
 Water expands when heated and contracts when cooled.<br>
 1. Give out the materials and tell them to push the clean ball pen tube 
through the small hole in the cork.<br>
 2. Fill your bottle with coloured water right up to the top.<br>
 Push the cork gently, but firmly into the bottle so that the coloured water
is a short distance up the clear tube.<br>
 3. Mark on the side of the tube the level of the coloured water as mark
 1.<br>
 4. Light your burners.<br>
 Heat the bottle of coloured water gently on the heating stand.<br>
 Closely watch the level of the coloured water in the tube.<br>
 What happens to the level of the water? [The water level rises.]<br>
 Mark the new level on the side of the tube as mark 2.<br>
 5. Give a reason the water has risen. [It expands when heated.]<br>
 6. Take the bottle away from the flame.<br>
 Watch the level of the water in the tube.<br>
 What happens to the water level? [The water level falls back to mark (1).]<br>
 Give a reason the water level falls. [The water contracts.]<br>
 7. Show the children a thermometer and show how the temperature changes 
 when the bulb is placed in hot water, then in cold water.<br>
 Explain how thermometers are used to measure the air temperature and your
body temperature.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="6.10H"></a>6.10 Pull with pulleys<br>
<a href="./images/21.5.0.gif">See diagram 21.5.0</a>: Types of pulleys.<br>
 Use pieces of string three metres long, small pieces of string 40 cm long, 
pulleys (fixed and movable), bags full of sand or soil<br>
 (for loads), sticks or strong rulers.<br>
 A force can be a push or a pull.<br>
 Forces cause things to move.<br>
 If you push or pull a small object it can start to move.<br>
 If you increase the force, it can move faster.<br>
 In the same way if you want to stop a moving object then you must push
 or pull it in the opposite direction.<br>
 If an object is not moving, it does not mean that there are no forces on
it.<br>
 An object will not move if there are equal and opposite forces acting on
it.<br>
 When a force causes an object to move then work is done.<br>
 Sometimes work cannot be done, because the object is too heavy.<br>
 The force needed to move it is too big.<br>
 Machines make work easier for us by decreasing the force needed to do the
work.<br>
 Teach the children to use pulleys to change the direction of a pull and 
to move heavy loads.<br>
 One type of machine is the pulley.<br>
 The pulley is a grooved wheel.<br>
 The pulley with a rope or a chain is used to lift heavy objects or to change
the direction of a force.<br>
 A pulley can be used in two ways:<br>
 1. a fixed pulley changes the direction of the force and<br>
 2. a moveable pulley makes the force needed smaller.<br>
 If a fixed pulley and a moveable pulley are used together then the direction 
 of the force is changed and the force needed is smaller.<br>
 Draw a diagram on the chalkboard showing the way the equipment is set up.<br>
 1. Tie the load to the string and pull it along the desk top by pulling
 the string towards them.<br>
 Can you move the load away from them and still pull the string towards
 them?<br>
 2. Ask successful groups to show how they did it. [This can be done if a
pencil is held by another child at the other end of the desk,<br>
 and the string passed around the pencil.]<br>
 Give out a pulley to each group.<br>
 3. Use the pulley instead of the pencil and try again.<br>
 Is it to pull with the pencil or with the pulley? [Pulley.]<br>
 Why? [The pulley wheel can move freely.]<br>
 4. Show the children your chalkboard diagram then tell them to set up the
fixed and moveable pulleys.<br>
 Check that each group has arranged the pulleys correctly.<br>
 Each child should take it in turns to hold the neck of the bag between
 finger and thumb and pull it.<br>
 Now use the pulleys.<br>
 Hold the free end of the long string between finger and thumb and pull
 so that the bag moves from one end of the desk to the other.<br>
 5. Have you found any differences? [It should be easier when the moveable
 pulleys are used as in the diagram.<br>
 The pull should be smaller than in the diagram, but the distance pulled 
will be greater.]<br>
 6. How can you lift the load above your heads using the string and pulley?<br>
 Tie your pulleys to a beam across the classroom roof, and to pull up your
loads using these pulleys.<br>
 What could you use a pulley for? [Lifting heavy loads.]<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="6.11H"></a>6.11 Coins on a slope<br>
<a href="./images/16.160.gif">See diagram 16.160</a>: Start and stop.<br>
<a href="./images/16.4.0.gif">See diagram 16.4.0</a>: Forces.<br>
 Use coins of different sizes and a ruler.<br>
 This lesson is designed to train children to observe what happens when
 a force is increased and to introduce the idea of the force of<br>
 gravity that causes the weight of objects.<br>
 Teach the children to explain why an object can slide down a slope and 
move another object.<br>
 1. A force is a push or a pull.<br>
 A force can make an object start moving, stop or change direction.<br>
 In this lesson you will use forces to start things moving and find out 
why they stop moving.<br>
 2. Hold down a 20 cent coin with your finger.<br>
 Move the coin sideways to hit a 10 cent coin.<br>
 What does the 10 cent coin do? [It starts moving.] Measure how far it moves.<br>
 Hit the 10 cent coin again, but this time hit it harder.<br>
 Measure the distance the 10 cent coin moved.<br>
 What difference did you see? [The 10 cent coin moved faster and farther.]<br>
 How did the 20 cent coin move? [It moved faster the second time.]<br>
 Why did the 10 cent coin move faster and farther? [The 20 cent coin moved 
with more force.]<br>
 3. Make a slope with a ruler.<br>
 Slide a 20 cent coin down a slope to hit a 10 cent coin.<br>
 Note the height of the slope and how far the 10 cent coin moves.<br>
 Table of Results<br>
 Height of slope<br>
 Distance of 10 cent coin<br>
 4. What did you notice about the speed of the 20 cent coin when the height 
of the slope increased? [It moved faster.]<br>
 What did you notice about the distance the 10 cent coin moved when the 
height of the slope increased? [It moved farther.]<br>
 Why did these increases occur? [The force of the 20 cent coin hitting the
10 cent coin increased as the height of the slope increased.]<br>
 5. Put a coin on the flat table.<br>
 Will it move sideways by itself? [No.]<br>
 What can make it move sideways? [A force.]<br>
 Pick up a coin.<br>
 Can it move by itself? [Yes.] Let it go.<br>
 What happens? [It falls.]<br>
 Why did it move? Did you make it move with a force? [No.]<br>
 Did anything push it? [No.]<br>
 Did anything pull it? [Yes, it was pulled down by the force of gravity.]<br>
 6. The earth pulls all things towards it.<br>
 This pull is called the force of gravity.<br>
 Hold a coin in your hand.<br>
 Can you feel a downwards force? [Yes.]<br>
 What do you call this force? [The weight of the coin.]<br>
 The weight of the object is the pull down caused by the force of gravity.<br>
 7. When you hold a coin in your hand is there a pull down on the coin? 
[Yes.]<br>
 Does the coin move down? [No.]<br>
 Why not? [The coin does not move down, because your hand pushes up the coin.<br>
 The pull down on the coin is equal to the push up by your hand, so the 
coin does not move.]<br>
 When an object does not move this is, because the pull down is equal to the
push up on it.<br>
 8. Slide a coin down a slight slope.<br>
 Why does the coin slide down? [It is pulled down by the force of gravity.] 
<br>
 Why does it slide slowly? [There is some push on the coin by the sloping 
 ruler.]<br>
 Make the slope steeper.<br>
 Slide the coin down.<br>
 Why does the coin slide down more quickly? [The coin is pulled down by the
force of gravity.<br>
 The sloping ruler pushes up less on the coin.]<br>
 Turn the ruler over.<br>
 What happens to the coin? [It falls very fast.]<br>
 Why does it fall so fast? [It is pulled down by the force of the gravity, 
 the ruler does not push up on it at all so there is nothing to<br>
 stop the coin from falling.]<br>
 An object falls down when the force pushing up on it is less than its mass.<br>
 9. Repeat the experiment as above, but use a 10 cent coin sliding down to
hit a 20 cent coin.<br>
 What do you see? [The distance the 20 cent coin is pushed along the table 
is less.]<br>
 10. Can you explain why a ripe mango or orange fruit drops to the ground
 from the tree? 11. Force<br>
 1. What is a force? [A push or a pull.],<br>
 2. Can a force start things moving? [Yes.],<br>
 3. Can a force stop things that are moving? [Yes.],<br>
 4. Can a force make a moving thing change direction? [Yes.],<br>
 5. Which ball hits your hand with the greatest force, the heavy ball or
the light ball? [The heavy ball.],<br>
 6. The ball thrown high or ball thrown low? [High.],<br>
 7. See a coconut on a tree.<br>
 Is there a force pulling down the coconut? [Yes.],<br>
 8. What is the force called? [Weight.],<br>
 9. Is there a force pushing up? [Yes.], 10. What is pulling it up? [The 
 tree.],<br>
 11. Which force is bigger? [If the coconut stays on the tree then, Force 
 down = force up.]<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="6.12H"></a>6.12 Float Plasticine boat<br>
(1 millilitre, mL, is a basic unit of capacity)
 Use Plasticine, a jar and water.<br>
 An object that sinks can be made to float by increasing its volume so that
the weight of the object is less than the weight of the water<br>
 displaced. one mL of water weighs close to one gram.<br>
 Make the boat by moulding the Plasticine around a small jar.<br>
 Try out the experiment before the lesson.<br>
 This will give an idea of the extent to which it can work.<br>
 This discussion can help in explaining the floating of ships and liners.
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Teach the children to explain why an object that
 sinks in water can be made to float.<br>
 1. Half fill a jar with water, mark the level of the water on the side
 of the jar.<br>
 2. Make a piece of Plasticine into the shape of a boat with high sides.<br>
 Float the boat in the jar of water.<br>
 What happens to the level of water in the jar? [It goes up.]<br>
 Why did the level of the water go up? [It was pushed up by the part of the
boat under the water.]<br>
 3. Now sink the boat.<br>
 What happens to the level of the water in the jar? [It drops.]<br>
 What does this new level tell you? [This is the volume of the Plasticine
 used to make the boat.]<br>
 Was the volume of the Plasticine greater or less than the volume of the 
floating boat? [Much less.]<br>
 What is the weight of the boat?<br>
 4. Float the boat again.<br>
 Add bits of Plasticine so that it floats lower in the water.<br>
 What has happened to the level of water as the boat floated lower? [It 
rose.]<br>
 Why did it rise? [The boat has pushed out more water as it floated lower.]<br>
 Why did the boat sink down more? [It is heavier or more massive with bits
of Plasticine in it.]<br>
 5. Add more Plasticine until the boat is just floating.<br>
 It cannot float any lower without sinking.<br>
 What is the volume of the boat? [Equal to the volume of the water pushed
 out.]<br>
 6. Find the weight of the water pushed out.<br>
 7. Conclusion: An object floats when the weight of the object is less than
the weight of the water it pushes out or displaces.<br>
 8. How does step 7 above explain floating of ships? [The weight of the 
ship is less than the weight of the water displaced.]<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="6.13H"></a>6.13 Forces of friction<br>
<a href="./images/17.264.gif">See diagram 17.264</a>: Reduce friction with ball bearings.<br>
 Teach the children to explain what causes friction and how you can reduce 
 it.<br>
 Use three new match boxes, full of sand and full of nails, heavy book, piece
of string, lead pencils.<br>
 Friction has both advantages and disadvantages.<br>
 Friction allows us to walk without falling over and to pull a thread with
a needle.<br>
 Smooth car tires have less friction on the road than tires with tread.<br>
 Which tyre is the safest?<br>
 Friction is also the cause of wear of the moving parts of engines so you
have to reduce friction with lubricants, e.g. motor oil.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">1. Rub your dry hands together.<br>
 What do you feel? [Hands get hot.]<br>
 Wet your hands and do it again.<br>
 What do you feel? [Not hot.]<br>
 2. Explain that your hot hands are caused by the force of friction.<br>
 When two things rub over each other there is a force in the opposite direction
to the movement called friction.<br>
 When you wet your hands, they were lubricated with water.<br>
 The water between the hands reduced the friction.<br>
 To stop the metal parts of engines rubbing on each other you use oil called
lubricating oil.<br>
 3. Show the children a matchbox and matchsticks.<br>
<a href="./images/3.1.2.6ach.jpg">See diagram 3.1.2.6</a>: Matchbox.<br>
 Where do you strike the match? [Strike on the black part at the side.]<br>
 Try to strike the match on the smooth part.<br>
 Why does the match not light? [Because you struck it on the part that is
smooth.<br>
 You must strike it in the black part that is rough where there will be more
friction.]<br>
 4. Matchbox race<br>
<a href="./images/3.1.2.6ach.jpg">See diagram 3.1.2.6</a>: Matchbox.<br>
 Label the matchboxes full of sand "S" for smooth and "R" for rough.<br>
 Label the heavy matchbox "H".<br>
 Do not tell the children what the letter means.<br>
 Put the three matchboxes in line on the end of the heavy book.<br>
 "S" is lying on the smooth side.<br>
 "R" is on its black side.<br>
 It is lying on its smooth side.<br>
 Tip up the book.<br>
 Which matchbox comes first, second and third? Do it often and put the results
on the chalkboard.<br>
 Let the children pick up the matchboxes then explain the race using the 
word friction.<br>
 Smooth comes first, because the force of friction is least between the smooth
side and the book, rough comes second, because it is<br>
 sliding on its back rough side so the force of friction is greater.<br>
 You are the same weight.<br>
 Heavy comes last, because a heavy weight increases the force of friction
 a lot.<br>
 You can reduce friction by changing sliding motion to rolling motion.<br>
 Put a piece of string through a book and roll it along.<br>
 Now put the book on pencil rollers.<br>
 What do you feel? [The pull needed is less.]<br>
 5. Methods of reducing friction<br>
 The simplest method of reducing friction is to place rollers between the
two surfaces.<br>
 This method is used when boats are launched, or when heavy wooden crates
 have to be moved.<br>
 Here linear friction is replaced by rolling friction.<br>
 Ball bearings are used to reduce friction for revolving shafts.<br>
 The axle of a bicycle is mounted in ball bearings.<br>
 The ball race shown is similar to the ball race used in a bicycle.<br>
 Friction is thus reduced by:<br>
 1.Replacing linear friction with rolling friction, and<br>
 2.By using hard surfaces, because hard surfaces have less friction than softer surfaces.<br>
 Lubrication is the most common method of reducing friction.<br>
 On a bicycle all moving parts have small holes through which oil is squirted 
so that the parts that move in contact with one another are<br>
 covered in oil.<br>
 On a motor car, grease nipples are provided for the same purpose and grease
is forced under pressure through those nipples.<br>
 6. How does friction help in increasing or decreasing the speeds of athletes 
at sports meets?<br>
 [Runners need friction between their shoes and the track to give forward 
 motion.<br>
 Soccer players use friction between the air and the soccer ball to bend 
 it in flight.<br>
 They kick the ball to give it spin to increase friction with the air to
make the ball curve.]<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="6.15H"></a>6.15 How far can you see?<br>
 In the human eye the distance between the lens and the screen (the retina) 
 remains the same whether you try to see things near or far.<br>
 What changes is the shape of the lens controlled by muscles in your eye.<br>
 1. Look outside the classroom at something far away.<br>
 Hold up one finger 20 cm in front of your eyes, but keep looking at the 
distant object.<br>
 Can you see the distant object clearly? [Yes.]<br>
 Can you see your finger clearly? [Not at first.]<br>
 Can you feel any movement in your eyes? [Yes.]<br>
 Is the distant object clear now that the finger is clear? [If you keep 
looking at your finger then the distant object will not be clear.]<br>
 2. Hold a printed page at arm's length.<br>
 Bring the book closer and closer until it is just too close to read the 
letters.<br>
 Measure the distance from the book to the eyes with a ruler and record 
it in your notebook.<br>
 Move the book away from the eyes until it is just too far to read the letters.<br>
 Measure the distance and record.<br>
 3. Compare the distance recorded with other children.<br>
 Are they all the same? [No, the answers should vary.]<br>
 4. Judging distance game<br>
 One child of each pair puts a hand over one eye.<br>
 The other child holds up one finger about 40 cm in front of the partner's 
 eyes.<br>
 The child with one eye covered has to place the tip of one fingers on top
of the finger that the partner is holding up.<br>
 [This is difficult to do, because you need both eyes to judge distances.]
 Uncover your eyes and try again.<br>
 [It should be easy for them with both eyes open.] Partners swap places 
and repeat the activity.<br>
 What conclusion?<br>
 [We need both eyes to judge distance correctly.]<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="6.17H"></a>6.17 Relative humidity<br>
<a href="./images/37.114.gif">See diagram 37.114</a>: Wet and dry bulb thermometer.<br>
<a href="./physics/UNPh37.html#37.8.4">See 37.8.4</a> Relative humidity table, depression of the wet bulb.<br>
 Use Figures of humidity measurements, thermometer and a piece of cloth.<br>
 Humidity is a measure of how much water vapour in the air.<br>
 More water vapour can be in the air at higher temperatures than at lower 
 temperatures, so if the temperature drops the water vapour<br>
 will condense as rain.<br>
 The relative humidity used in weather forecasting is a measure of how much
water vapour held in the air compared with the amount it<br>
 could hold.<br>
 In the Solomon Islands humidity is always high.<br>
 It does not change much during the year, but it varies during the day.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2">
 At night the relative humidity is always greater then 90%.<br>
 The lowest relative humidity occurs during the hottest times of the year.<br>
 Children should understand that the climate of the Solomon Islands is hot and humid whereas in some places such as Western Australia and California it is hot dry.<br>
 In Honiara there is the biggest change in relative humidity, because the winds usually shift from southerly in the early mornings to northerly in the afternoon.<br>
 Use a bottle and running water.<br>
 You can make a wet bulb thermometer with a thermometer and a piece of cloth.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Teach the children to explain the importance of humidity in your climate.<br>
 1. Hold a bottle under a running tap and breathe into the bottle.<br>
 What do you see? [The inside becomes cloudy.]<br>
 What is inside the bottle? [Water.]<br>
 Where did it come from? [Our lungs and the air.]<br>
 2. What do you see inside the walls of a freezer? [Ice.]<br>
 Where does the ice come from? [It comes from the water in the air.]<br>
 3. Air can hold water in it as a gas.<br>
 This gas is called water vapour.<br>
 How much water in the air is called the humidity.<br>
 The climate of the Solomon Islands is always humid compared with many other countries.<br>
 The humidity is high, because the country is near the equator and so the climate is hot.<br>
 The winds come from over the sea picking up water.<br>
 4. If humidity is high, metal rusts easily, fungus diseases can live in the air and people feel hot, because they cannot cool down so much by sweating.<br>
 So remember that there may be problems with imported machines or seeds if they come from countries where humidity is low.<br>
 5. Cover the bulb of a thermometer with cloth and dip this in water.<br>
 The temperature should drop.<br>
 The greater the drop in temperature the lower the humidity.<br>
 The instrument used to measure relative humidity is a hygrometer.<br>
 The hygrometer described in the activity uses two thermometers, a dry bulb thermometer and a wet bulb thermometer.<br>
 The dry bulb thermometer is simply an ordinary mercury or spirit thermometer used to measure the temperature of the air.<br>
 The wet bulb thermometer has the bulb is<br>
 covered with cloth kept moist by means of a cotton wick and a glass of water.<br>
 Evaporation cools the bulb and makes the reading lower than the dry bulb thermometer.<br>
 The two thermometers are used in conjunction by means of tables to find relative humidity.<br>
 The higher the humidity, the greater the difference in temperature between the two thermometers.<br>

 Use coins, glasses of water with cardboard lids, drinking straws or tubing.<br>
 If you have a simple barometer or aneroid barometer you can use it in the lesson.<br>
 The average mean sea level pressures for example at Honiara in millibars (mb) are as follows:

Teach the children to state how atmospheric pressure (air pressure) affects weather.<br>
 1. Give each group a coin.<br>
 Wet one side and then press it on the forehead.<br>
 Why does the coin not fall down? [The air presses it against the forehead.]<br>
 2. Give each group a glass full of water covered with a cardboard lid.<br>
 Turn it upside down.<br>
 Why does the water stay in the glass? [The air presses the cardboard against the water.]<br>
 In which direction does the air press? [The air presses in all directions.]<br>
 3. Give each group a straw or tube and a glass of water.<br>
 Suck on the straw until the water is half way up it.<br>
 Why does the water go up the tube? [When you suck in some air, the air pressure in the straw becomes less.<br>
 Then the air pressing on the water in the glass pushes some water up the straw.]<br>
 Put your first finger over the top of the straw and hold up the straw.<br>
 Why does the water stay in the straw? [The air is pressing up.]<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">4. Explain that air pressure can change.<br>
 Air pressure is greatest at sea level and gets less with height.<br>
 Air pressure can also change at one place.<br>
 When the air pressure is fine, the weather will stay fine.<br>
 When the air pressure is low, rain clouds will come and there will be wet weather.<br>
 Very low air pressure occurs before a cyclone.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">5. Air pressure is measured with a barometer.<br>
 This is a tube closed at one end.<br>
 The other end is open in a bowl of mercury.<br>
 Mercury is a very heavy liquid.<br>
 When the air pressure is high, the mercury is pushed high up the tube.<br>
 When the air pressure is low, the mercury is lower in the tube.<br>
 On a fine day at sea level the atmospheric pressure is 760 mm of mercury.<br>
 6. Read a barometer every day.<br>
 Note when the pressure is high and when it is low.<br>
 7. Make a table to show some daily records of air pressure at 9.00 a.m.<br>

<a href="./images/36.28.1.gif">See diagram 36.28.1</a>: Phases of the moon in a classroom.<br>
 Use custom stories and observed movements of the moon.<br>
 This activity consists of three parts: custom stories about the moon and tides, movements of tides, movements of the moon.<br>
 There are many interesting stories about the moon.<br>
 Some people see a woman weaving baskets in it.<br>
 Some people think it is a friend of Halley's Comet, which reappears every 76 years, called the smoking star.<br>
 The palolo worm, which is a swimming annelid worm, rises to the surface on the second night after the full moon in November.<br>
 Then they mate and lay their eggs.<br>
 Teach the children to explain how to make and use different kinds of natural fertilizers.<br>
 Try to find out the times for high and low tide and the phase of the moon.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Teach the children to observe the moon and tides and try to find a connection between their movements.<br>
 1. When do you get high tides and low tides during the day? [Two high tides and two low tides each day, about 12 hours apart.]<br>
 2. Are the heights of the high tide and low tide always the same during the month? [No.]<br>
 3. Are the heights of the high tide and low tide the same during the year? [No.]<br>
 4. What else changes during the month? [The moon.]<br>
 How does it change? [First there is a new moon when you can hardly see it then it gets bigger until a full moon, then it gets smaller.]<br>
 How many days between full moons? [30.]<br>
 How many days in a month? [31, 30, 28.]<br>
 5. Can you see any connection between the moon and the tides?<br>
 6. Can you remember any custom stories about the moon and the tides?<br>
 7. Make a wall chart on the phases of the moon.<br>
 Rule the chart into squares and number the squares with the dates of the month.<br>
 Each evening a different child has to look for the moon then draw it on the chart the next day.<br>
 Wall chart on the tides, tide during the day.<br>
 Measure the depth of the tide each hour and mark on the wall chart.<br>
 Measure the highest tide and lowest tide each day and mark on the wall chart.<br>
 8. The Sun force is about 5 / 11 of the Moon force on the earth, but they can act conjointly.<br>
 When a high tide occurs on one side of the Earth a high tide occurs on the other side of the Earth.<br>
 Spring tides are higher than other tides and occur just after new Moon and full Moon when the gravitational attraction of both the Sun<br>
 and the Moon act in a direct line.<br>
 Spring tides are nothing to do with the spring season.<br>
 They "spring up" higher than the other tides.<br>
 When the Moon is at first quarter or third quarter, the tide is minimum, has the least rise and fall, and is called the neap tides.<br>
 The rise and fall of the neap tides is about half that of the spring tides.<br>

 Teach the children to observe the movement of stars in the Southern Cross constellation.<br>
 Use evening and night observations of the stars in the Southern Cross and custom stories about it.<br>
 Make sure you can find the Southern Cross and pointers.<br>
 When you have done that, you can show the position of this constellation to children who will do their observations at night.<br>
 1. Draw the Southern Cross constellation and pointers on the chalk board and show the children in what part of the sky these stars can be seen.<br>
 2. Look for these stars that evening.<br>
 The next day, make sure that you really did see the Southern Cross.<br>
 Then tell the children to observe it the next evening at three different times: 6: 00 p.m., 7: 00 p.m. and 8: 00 p.m.<br>
 Draw it and another object such as a tree at these times.<br>
 3. The next day, look at their drawings.<br>
 Do you realize that the Southern Cross and all stars appear to move in a circle to the right?<br>
 This shows that the earth is turning.<br>
 4. Show the children how to find South by extending Gamma, Alpha Crusis × 3, then dropping to the earth.<br>
 5. Do you know any traditional stories about the Southern Cross?<br>
 Some people said that the Southern Cross is a fishing net suspended on four poles and the pointers are two fishermen.<br>
 Some people said that the appearance of the Southern Cross in March told them to start planting yams.<br>

<a href="./images/9.53.9.gif">See diagram 9.53.9</a>: Acacia.<br>
 Teach the children to identify and describe some trees, shrubs and herbs 
 in the locality.<br>
 Use local examples of herbs, shrubs and trees, plant presses.<br>
 The plants you know as trees, shrubs and herbs or bushy plants have the 
parts of their flowers in fives, leaves shaped like hands with<br>
 three parts, a tap root, and the trees and shrubs are woody.<br>
 Trees are tall with usually one main stem.<br>
 Shrubs are smaller and branch near the ground.<br>
 Trees include the mango tree, cassia trees, Acacia, Casuarina or she oak
and Ngali Nut tree.<br>
 Shrubs include <i>Euphorbia</i>, Hibiscus, side herbs include most weeds, 
 e.g.<i> Commelina</i>.<br>
 1. Explain the difference between trees, shrubs and herbs and show the 
children some examples. [See the differences above.]<br>
 2. Look at a herb.<br>
 Does it have a stem? [Yes.]<br>
 What is the shape of the leaf? [Like a hand.]<br>
 What kind of root does it have? [A tap root and smaller roots.]<br>
 Does it have flowers? [Yes.]<br>
 3. List all the trees, shrubs and herbs you know.<br>
 They may have to stroll around the area.<br>
 4. Some herbs are thin stemmed vines, some are called climbers, e.g. passion
fruit (<i>Granadilla</i>) and <span style="font-style: italic;H">Bougainvillaea</span>.<br>
 Some are creepers, e.g.<i> Basella</i> (Indian Spinach.)<br>
 5. Garden Walk See the trees, shrubs and herbs.<br>
 6. Display of cut out shapes of trees, shrubs and herbs.<br>
 Hold a piece of paper up and draw the shape of the tree on it.<br>
 Cut it out and stick it on the display board.<br>
 Can you tell a tree by its shape? You could also display herbarium specimens 
 of various trees, shrubs and herbs.<br>
 Can you identify the specimens?<br>

 Natural fertilizers<br>
 | <a href="./images/6.65.1.gif">See diagram 6.65.1</a>: Soil nutrient cycle 1.<br>
 | <a href="./images/6.65.2.gif">See diagram 6.65.2</a>: Soil nutrient cycle 2.<br>
 Use soil, plant ash, manure, food wastes and cut grass.<br>
 In traditional agriculture, people cut down and burn the forest, plant
 crops, farm the land for a few years, then regeneration of a<br>
 secondary forest for 5-12 years before using the land again for crops.<br>
 This method of bush fallow is using natural fertilizers to improve the 
soil.<br>
 You can speed up this method and grow crops more often by using the following 
methods of natural fertilizing.<br>
 White plant ash is mainly potash.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Teach the children to explain how to make and
 use different kinds of natural fertilizers.<br>
 1. Explain the traditional methods of natural fertilizing.<br>
 How long is the fallow period in your area? Explain that by using the following
methods the use of natural fertilizers is improved and<br>
 you can grow crops more often on the same piece of land.<br>
 2. The methods are as follows: 2.1 composting and mulching, 2.2 plant ash, 
2.3 green manure, 2.4 liquid manure.<br>
 3. Composting means to make a compost heap on the ground out of layers
 of different wastes that can rot.<br>
 Such wastes include onion, plantain and yam peels from the kitchen or any
soft wastes for that matter.<br>
 After how many days does their own heap start to lower in the soil?<br>
 4. If mulch covers the soil for a long time, the bottom layer becomes rotten
compost.<br>
 Do not dig mulch into the soil unless it is rotten.<br>
 5. White plant ash (potash) contains plant food.<br>
 Burn old leaves and stumps until all the black charcoal is gone leaving
 only the white ash.<br>
 Spread it evenly over the soil.<br>
 Rake or dig it into the soil, do not let it blow away or wash away.<br>
 Compare this with what happens in farm lands or when farm land is cleared
 for local housing.<br>
 6. Green manure is made from local leguminous plants that grow and can 
be easily dug into the soil, e.g. cow pea and <i>Crotalaria</i>.<br>
 Digging in is hard work.<br>
 When these plants rot in the soil they fertilize it.<br>
 7. Liquid manure is used for small individual plants that may be burnt
 if you use new chicken manure or pig manure.<br>
 Fill a steel drum with water and throw in any animal manure.<br>
 Keep a lid on the drum, because it will smell.<br>
 If you pour some manure liquid on the soil, the plants will grow fast.<br>
 8. Take the children on a garden walk to see the four methods of using
 natural fertilizers.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Chemical Fertilizers<br>
 Teach the children to explain why chemical fertilizers are used and how 
you are put in the soil.<br>
 Use samples of chemical fertilizers.<br>
 Chemical fertilizers are made in factories overseas.<br>
 For example, superphosphate is made from phosphate rock.<br>
 these fertilizers are expensive to buy and can easily be wasted if not 
used properly.<br>
 There is no need to use them in school gardens, but children should know 
about them.<br>
 Some plant foods such as potash are not enough in tropical gardens to get
good root crops.<br>
 A small amount of white plant ash or chemical fertilizer increases the 
yield greatly.<br>
 Plantation crops such as coconut and cocoa may need a lot of chemical fertilizer
because the crops have high yields, year after year.<br>
 Chemical fertilizers replace the plant foods lost from the soil.<br>
 The three main plant foods in mixed chemical fertilizers are nitrogen (N), 
phosphorus (P) and potash (K.]<br>
 Other plant foods such as boron (B) may be used for vegetables.<br>
 On the chemical fertilizer bag you can read (a) the name of the factory, 
 (b) the weight of the fertilizer, (c) the grade formula,<br>
 e.g. NPK 12: 4: 19, showing the amount of main plant foods.<br>
 Another mixed fertilizer NPK 12: 12: 17 contains more phosphorus and less 
potash.<br>
 Also there are some simple fertilizers which contain mainly nitrogen, sulfate
of ammonia, urea, phosphorus superphosphate, potash,<br>
 muriate of potash, sulfate of potash.<br>
 Chemical fertilizers are put in the soil in three ways:<br>
 1. Spread over the soil before planting then plough in,<br>
 2. Place the fertilizer in a band under the soil parallel to the seeds, 
 called banding,<br>
 3. After the crops have started growing, give side dressing or top dressing 
 of fertilizer between the rows.<br>
 Because chemical fertilizer is so expensive you should ask an agricultural
 officer to:<br>
 1. Tell you if fertilizers are is really necessary to increase yield,<br>
 2. Calculate the amount needed.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">1. Show the children the fertilizer bag.<br>
 Tell the children that the bag contains chemical fertilizer that is made 
in factories in other countries.<br>
 If used properly you can increase the amount of food you can grow, but you
are very expensive.<br>
 Read what is written on the bag aloud to the children and explain it to
them.<br>
 2. Explain that there are different kinds of plant foods.<br>
 Some chemical fertilizers contain a mixture of food plants and others contain
only one or two food plants.<br>
 For example sweet potato and coconut both need a lot of the plant food
 called potash.<br>
 For our vegetable garden we get enough potash from the white ash formed
 when trees are burnt.<br>
 However, on a coconut plantation a lot of the potash plant food is used 
 in the coconuts so the chemical fertilizer called muriate of<br>
 potash, KCl, may be used.<br>
 3. Explain the three methods of putting chemical fertilizer in the soil, 
 spreading, bonding, side or top dressing.<br>
 Explain why an agricultural officer should be asked to advise before using
chemical fertilizers: 1.<br>
 need to calculate rate of application, 2. need to save money, 3. need to
make sure that the fertilizer will increase yield.<br>
 4. Take the children to a garden or plantation where chemical fertilizer
 is being applied<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="6.26H"></a>6.26 Grasses<br>
<a href="./images/9.52.gif">See diagram 9.52</a>: Grass plant.<br>
 Teach the children to:<br>
 1. describe and identify the parts of grass and how they grow and<br>
 2. distinguish between grasses and sedges.<br>
 Grasses are the most useful group of plants.<br>
 They have many small flowers and, except bamboo, grow close to the ground 
 as runners or tufts.<br>
 They have a special shape of leaf.<br>
 Each leaf has a leaf blade, sheath and a ligule.<br>
 They have parallel veins.<br>
 Sedges have angular stems while grasses have round stems.<br>
 1. Give each group different kinds of grass.<br>
 What do you call these plants? [Grass.]<br>
 How are they different? [Tufted grass grows upright in a clump, rumour
 grass grows along the ground, bamboo is very tall and has<br>
 a woody stem, cereals have large grains that you can eat.]<br>
 2. Look at the tufted grass and runner grass.<br>
 How are the grasses different from bushes and trees? [Grasses are small
 plants, they may cover the ground, they have very small<br>
flowers and seeds, cereals produce grains. They have fibrous roots.]<br>
 3. Describe the grass roots.<br>
 [Lots of small roots that grow from the same place, bushes and trees have
a long tap root and smaller roots from growing along it.]<br>
 4. Describe the grass stem.<br>
 [Most grasses have no stem, cereals and bamboo have a kind of stem that 
 may be hollow.]<br>
 5. Describe the grass leaves. [The leaves are quite different from the 
leaves of bushes and trees, grass leaves are long and thin, part<br>
 of them wraps around the other leaves or stem and part hangs down when
 it is old.]<br>
 6. Can you see the grass flowers? They are very small.<br>
 Large grass seeds are called grain.<br>
 7. Pull off a while grass leaf and draw it.<br>
 8. Pull off a sedge stem and compare with a grass stem.<br>
 9. Drawing the grass plants.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="6.27H"></a>6.27 Palms<br>
 <a href="./images/53.2.gif">See diagram 53.2</a>: Coconut palms.<br>
 <a href="./images/9.50.3.gif">See diagram 9.50.3</a>: Pandanus palm.<br>
<a href="./images/9.50.2.gif">See diagram 9.50.2</a>: Palm.<br>
 Teach the children to describe different palms and how they grow.<br>
 Use examples or pictures of palm plants, mosses and ferns.<br>
 Edible palms include coconut, sago, oil and date palms.<br>
 1. Give each group a piece of palm leaf.<br>
 What kind of plant is it from? [Palm.] How is it different from the fern 
or moss leaf? [It is much bigger, hard and shiny, divided into<br>
 strips.]<br>
 2. How many useful palms do you know? [Coconut, sago, raphia, nipa, betel, 
oil palm, pandanus.]<br>
 Do you know a useful palm that grows in the desert? [The date palm.]<br>
 There are many other kinds of palms in the forest.<br>
 Do you know any use for them?<br>
 3. Show the children a picture of a palm tree or show them a palm outside. 
<br>
 What do you notice about the following parts of a palm? The stem [It grows
straight up, no branches.]<br>
 How the leaves grow? [The leaves grow from the top of the stem, the youngest 
at the tip, the oldest hang down.]<br>
 The size of the leaves? [The leaves are very big.]<br>
 The shape of the leaves? [Split into strips or fan-shaped.]<br>
 The roots? [Shallow roots that may stick out before going into the ground.]<br>
 The fruit? [They can be large and heavy.]<br>
 4. Palms are one of the most useful plants in the world.<br>
 Palms are also special trees in the forest.<br>
 They grow very slowly so we should not cut them down unless you have a
good reason.<br>
 Be kind to palms.<br>
 5. Visit the forest and study the sago palm.<br>
 Before it flowers, you cut it down and wash the sago starch out of its 
trunk.<br>
 The leaves make good palm thatch.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="6.28H"></a>6.28 Ferns and mosses<br>
 | <a href="./images/9.48.2.gif">See diagram 9.48.2</a>: Pteridium bracken fern.<br>
 Teach the children to collect and describe different ferns and mosses.<br>
 Use different types of ferns and mosses:<br>
 1. Tiny, filmy ferns,<br>
 2. Bracken ferns that grew up out of the ground,<br>
 3. Tree ferns that are tall and have a kind of trunk,<br>
 4. Epiphytic ferns that grow high up on other plants and grow high up on
other plants to reach the light<br>
 Ferns do not have flowers, seeds or fruits.<br>
 They reproduce by tiny round spores from the underside of their leaves
 called fronds.<br>
 If they press a frond down on to inked paper, you can get an outline of
where the spores are made.<br>
 Ferns usually live in damp places or in the forest.<br>
 Mosses are tiny single plants that crowd together like the pile of a carpet.<br>
 Ferns are found in damp places.<br>
 They have root-like structures called rhizoids.<br>
 Use ferns to the lesson or prepare to go out to the forest to see different
 kinds of ferns.<br>
 Collect ferns with brown spores underneath.<br>
 The spores underneath are called sori, singular "sorus".<br>
 They are used for reproduction.<br>
 1. Show the class the different kinds of ferns and mosses.<br>
 Have you seen them before? Can ferns be poisonous? [Yes, some ferns can 
make cattle sick if they eat them.]<br>
 2. What do you see on the fern leaf (frond)? [Brown balls are under the 
frond.]<br>
 They are called spores or sori and are like little seeds.<br>
 They are used for reproduction.<br>
 3. Draw a fern leaf.<br>
 How is it different from the leaf of a tree? [It is much thinner and has
a different shape.]<br>
 4. Does it have flowers and fruits? [No.]<br>
 Does it have a stem? [Some have a kind of stem.]<br>
 Does it have a tap root? [No, it has little roots.]<br>
 5. Look at a piece of moss carpet.<br>
 Can you see the separate moss plants standing up straight?<br>
 Can you separate one moss plant?<br>
 Why do they all stand closely together? [To keep water between them and 
not get dry.]<br>
 Look at a single moss plant with the magnifier.<br>
 Does it have flowers? [No.]<br>
 Does it have leaves, stem and root? [Yes, but they are very small and 
simple.]<br>
 6. Make spore outlines on inked paper, or draw a harvested sample from 
a moss plant.<br>
 Use a magnifier for the initial observation.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="6.29H"></a>6.29 Protect coral reefs<br>
<a href="./images/6.62d.gif">See diagram 4.62</a>: Conserving land.<br>
 Teach the children to explain why we should stop loss of land and coral
 reefs by controlling water runoff.<br>
 Use examples of ridges and terraces.<br>
 If land is perfectly flat it cannot be washed away by rain, but it may 
be cut away by a river.<br>
 Heavy rain can cause loss of nutrients by leaching.<br>
 Sloping land can be washed away if water washes over it.<br>
 Loss of land can be prevented by covering the soil with grass and trees.<br>
 When people make gardens on slopes some soil will be washed into the valley
below to become valuable topsoil.<br>
 However, that topsoil will be lost if it is washed into the river and becomes
silt.<br>
 The silt can cover the animals in the coral reef and kill them.<br>
 Children should know how to prevent loss of land and coral reefs.<br>
 1. What will happen to the bare soil on slopes if it rains? [It is washed 
 down.]<br>
 Where does it go? [On to the land below.]<br>
 Where can it go? [Into the river.]<br>
 Where does the silt go? [Out to sea, it can cover the coral.]<br>
 2. How can you stop water washing the soil down?<br>
 [2.1. Grow crops in horizontal strips,<br>
 2.2. Build terraces to hold the soil back,<br>
 2.3. Dig horizontal ridges,<br>
 2.4. Dig drains to carry water away.]<br>
 3. What is the best way to protect a sloping level? [Cover with plants.]<br>
 4. Visit to ridges and terraces.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="6.31H"></a>6.31 Describe soils<br>
<a href="./images/6.36.3.gif">See diagram 6.36.3</a>: Examining soils.<br>
 Teach the children to link different types of soils with their physical 
 properties.<br>
 Use different kinds of soils in plastic bags, e.g. garden soil, sandy soil, 
clay soil, forest soil, magnifiers, water.<br>
 Examine soil types with special reference to the texture types.<br>
 1. Give soil samples and other materials to each group.<br>
 Label each soil sample Put garden soil in the glass jar, until it is about
one third full of soil.<br>
 Pour water from the bucket into the jar containing the soil until the jar
is two thirds full.<br>
 Put the lid on the jar and shake it strongly.<br>
 What happens inside the jar? [Solid particles settle to the bottom.]<br>
 2. What do you see from top to bottom in the jar? [Floating plant matter, 
 clay suspended in water, fine sand, coarse sand, pebbles.]<br>
 Put this jar where it will not be moved, because they will be looking at
it later in the lesson.<br>
 3. Examine each sample of soil<br>
 Which soil has the darkest colour? [Forest soil.]<br>
 Which soil feels the most sticky? [Forest soil.]<br>
 Which soil feels the driest? [Sandy soil.]<br>
 Which soil holds together most loosely? [Sandy soil.]<br>
 Which soil has the most plant matter? [Forest soils.]<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="6.32H"></a>6.32 Soil texture<br>
 Soil texture is the feel of the soil caused by the size of the soil particles.<br>
 2.1.1 Sandy soil has a coarse texture.<br>
 The sand particles are too large.<br>
 Sandy soils drain too quickly.<br>
 Sandy soils feel rough.<br>
 2.1.2 Clay soil has a fine texture.<br>
 The clay particles are too small.<br>
 Clay soils may not drain at all and the soil becomes waterlogged.<br>
 Clay soils feel smooth.<br>
 A good soil has a mixture of sand, clay and other particles between these 
sizes.<br>
 You can improve soil texture by mixing soils with different sized particles, 
 i.e.<br>
 add sandy soils to clay soils add clay soils to sandy soils.<br>
 Use samples of different soils, e.g. clay, silt, sand and a small quantity
 of water.<br>
 The texture of a soil affects soil characteristics such as ease of cultivation, 
 its ability to accept water and how much water it can hold<br>
 for plants and other organisms to use.<br>
 A quick and simple technique to measure soil texture is useful when deciding 
agricultural activities such as ploughing.<br>
 Soil texture reference information:<br>
 1. Sands have grains that do not stick together.<br>
 Sands cannot be moulded.<br>
 Single sand grains stick to the fingers.<br>
 2. Loam sands form fragile shapes that just stand handling, give short
 ribbons that break easily, usually discolour the fingers.<br>
 3. Fine sandy loam forms shapes that will just stand handling.<br>
 Fine sand grains may be felt, but otherwise they feel smooth and may feel 
greasy if much organic matter is present.<br>
 Fine sandy loam may be formed into ribbons 15 to 25 mm long.<br>
 4. Silt loam will stick together, but will crumble.<br>
 Silt loam feels very smooth and silky and may be formed into ribbons 25
mm long.<br>
 5. Clay loam will stick together to form shapes.<br>
 Clay loam has a spongy feel and is plastic when squeezed between the thumb
and forefinger.<br>
 It is smooth to manipulate and may be formed into ribbons 40-80 mm long.<br>
 6, Clays form smooth, plastics casts and show some resistance to manipulation, 
 i.e.<br>
 toughness.<br>
 They may be formed into ribbons at least 80 mm long, depending on heaviness
 of the clay.<br>
 Sand grains can be felt in sandy clays that may be formed into ribbons 
40-50 mm long.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Teach the children simple method to assess g the
 texture of soil.<br>
 1. Take a small amount of soil enough to fit in the palm of the hand.<br>
 Discard obvious pieces of gravel.<br>
 2. Moisten the soil with water, a little at a time and knead until there 
 is no apparent change in the feel of the ball.<br>
 The moisture constant should be such that the ball just fails to stick
 to the fingers.<br>
 3. Inspect the sample to see if sand is visible, if not, it may still be
felt and kneaded as the sample is worked.<br>
 5. Finally, squeeze it out between the thumb and forefinger with a sliding 
 motion and note the length of self supporting ribbon that can<br>
 be formed.<br>
 6. Give the children some pure sand, silt and clay to test.<br>
 Then test soil from:<br>
 6.1. a garden,<br>
 6.2. a forest,<br>
 6.3. bank of a river,<br>
 6.4. top of a slope,<br>
 6.5. bottom of a slope.<br>
 7. Make a soil texture museum.<br>

<a href="./images/3.2.0.3ch.gif">See diagram 3.2.0.3</a>: Speed of cooling.<br>
 Use small glass tubes, or any other glass container you can heat, burner, 
 or a candle in a holder, a wooden peg, two glass jars,<br>
 naphthalene (mothballs) or crystals of copper (II) sulfate or salt or sugar, 
silver foil or paper or cloth.<br>
 An igneous rock consists of crystals produced when the rock cooled from 
 a very hot liquid state.<br>
 Rocks that formed deep in the ground such as granite have large crystals.<br>
 Rock that formed on the ground after the liquid rock came out of volcanoes, 
 such as basalt, have small crystals.<br>
 Rocks formed deep in the ground cool slowly.<br>
 Rocks formed above the ground cool quickly.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Teach the children to discover whether the speed 
 of cooling affects the size of crystals and then discuss why rocks have 
different<br>
 sizes of crystals.<br>
 1. In this lesson you will imitate the cooling of an igneous rock.<br>
 2. Fill the two test-tubes with naphthalene to the one quarter mark, Using
the wooden peg, gently heat the test-tubes until the<br>
 naphthalene starts to melt.<br>
 3. Move the test-tubes about to distribute heat evenly.<br>
 Then remove the tubes from the flame and shake gently.<br>
 Heat a little more, then shake again.<br>
 Keep doing this until all the naphthalene has melted, or dissolve as many
crystals as you can in a small amount of warm water.<br>
 4. Quickly wrap the test-tube containing the melted naphthalene or crystal 
 in silver foil to keep it warm.<br>
 Then stand it in a large beaker.<br>
 5. Rapidly cool the second lot of melted naphthalene or dissolved crystals 
 in a beaker of cold water.<br>
 6. Observe the naphthalene or dissolved crystals in the two tubes and note
carefully the size of the crystals formed.<br>
 Why the crystals in the tubes are different sizes.<br>
 [Larger crystals formed in the tube wrapped in foil, because it cooled more
slowly than the tube in the cold water.]<br>
 7. What is the relationship between the rate of cooling and crystal size 
of igneous rocks? [The slower the speed of cooling the larger<br>
 the crystals formed.]<br>
 8. Can you find rocks that cooled quickly?<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Candle "lava"<br>

wax and discuss how molten rock cools.<br>
 Use candles, matches and a safe place to drop the wax.<br>
 Find time to do the activities recommended here.<br>
 1. Hold a lighted candle 30 cm above the tray to let drops of melted wax
fall on it.<br>
 <font color="#ff0000H">BE CAREFUL!</font><br>
 2. Repeat this procedure several times, holding the candle at different
 heights.<br>
 Observe the cooled drops.<br>
 3. From which height did the molten wax spatter the most? The least? What
shape did the cooled wax take?<br>
 4. Explain that volcanoes sometimes shoot out molten rock called lava.<br>
 Does this experiment explain the cooled shapes of lava from a volcanic
 eruption?<br>
 5. Study a volcano cone.<br>

 Teach children to explain how chemical fertilizers should be used.<br>
 1. Use Illustrations and real examples of chemical fertilizers, technical 
 information, artificial fertilizers.<br>
 It is unlikely that children will be using chemical fertilizers, but you 
can explain as follows.<br>
 Chemical fertilizers can increase yields so much that all village gardeners 
 should think about using them.<br>
 Chemical fertilizers are expensive, because they are all imported.<br>
 The use of chemical fertilizers must be exactly as recommended by the agricultural
officers.<br>
 Otherwise, money will be wasted.<br>
 Recommendations are based on type of crop and soil grouping.<br>
 2. Groups of soils in tropical areas<br>
 Coral beach sand soils are weakly weathered, alkaline, have moderate amount
of phosphorus and low amount of potassium.<br>
 Mineral beach sand soils are weakly weathered, weakly acid, and have moderate
amounts of phosphorus and potassium.<br>
 Alluvial soils, near rivers or on lower slopes are weakly weathered, weakly
acid or alkaline, good amounts of phosphorus and<br>
 moderate amounts of potassium.<br>
 Yellowish, brownish, reddish clays, form mainly on coral limestone.<br>
 Moderately to strongly weathered, acid, usually good amount of phosphorus, but low amount of potassium.<br>
 Reddish clays on volcanic rocks are strongly weathered, acid, low on phosphorus
and potassium.<br>
 From these descriptions of the soil group you can see that most gardens 
 may not have enough potassium in the soil.<br>
 Visit a plantation or project to see the use of chemical fertilizers.<br>

<a href="./images/51.9.gif">See diagram 51.9</a>: Planting banana.<br>
 1. You can save soil water in two ways:<br>
 1.1 Cut down weeds and bushes that grow near your coconuts, breadfruit, 
 vegetables or bananas.<br>
 Then the roots of these plants cannot steal the soil water.<br>
 1.2 Cover the surface of the soil around your plants with a layer of dead
leaves, grass or other material.<br>
 This layer is called a mulch.<br>
 The mulch stops the hot sun from making the soil surface dry.<br>
 2. Weeds and bushes take soil water from the coconuts, breadfruit and other
useful plants.<br>
 Cut down, but do not burn these weeds, because you can use them for mulch.<br>
 3. Mulch keeps the soil moist around plants.<br>
 Mulch is any light, loose covering on the soil, about 5 cm thick.<br>
 Do not dig mulch into the soil.<br>
 After light rain check that the mulch does not prevent any rain water from
reaching the soil.<br>
 Old dead grass, coconut leaves and breadfruit leaves make good mulch.<br>
 4. Some ways to save soil water:<br>
 4.1 Cut down weeds that steal soil water from trees.<br>
 4.2 Put a mulch of dead leaves around young trees or vegetables.<br>
 4.3 Make mulch.<br>
 Gather dead leaves or grass and make a mulch around some young tree, e.g.
a coconut seedling or a young breadfruit.<br>
 The next week, lift up the mulch to see that the soil under it is cool 
and moist.<br>

 Mulched Soil<br>
 1. Cooler soil<br>
 2. Damper soil<br>
 3. Less soil erosion<br>
 4. Darker topsoil (more organic matter)<br>
 5. Less evaporation from the soil<br>
 6. Less germination of weed seeds, but mulch may contain weed seeds<br>
 7. Weeds easier to pull out<br>
 8. Fewer weeds, but mulch itself may contain weed seeds<br>
 Not Mulched Soil<br>
 1. Warmer soil<br>
 2. Dryer soil<br>
 3. More soil erosion<br>
 4. Lighter topsoil, less organic matter<br>
 5. More evaporation from the soil<br>
 6. More germination of weed seeds<br>
 7. Weeds harder to pull out<br>
 8. More weeds<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="6.37H"></a>6.37 Electric circuit<br>
<a href="./images/32.2.1d.gif">See diagram: 32.2.1</a>: Simple electric circuit.<br>
 Use torch light batteries, wires, sticky tape, bulbs, bulb holders.<br>
 Electricity can only be generated if there is a complete circuit.<br>
 Revise electric circuits before the lesson.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Teach the children to set up an electric circuit
 to light a light bulb.<br>
 1. Give each group a battery, wires and a light bulb.<br>
 You must need some sticky tape to hold the wires on the bulb contacts.<br>
 Do not show the children what to do.<br>
 Light the bulb.<br>
 Which group can do it first?<br>
 Can you tell the other groups how you did it?<br>
 This is one way of encouraging the scientific attitude.<br>
 2. Look at the torch battery.<br>
 What do you see at each end? [The top has a bump marked on it and is marked
"+", the bottom is marked "-". Each end is made of<br>
 metal.]<br>
 How did you make the bulb light? [One wire touches one end of the battery.<br>
 The other wire touches the other end of the battery.]<br>
 3. Look at the light bulb.<br>
 What do you see inside the glass bulb? [A thin twisted wire called the 
filament.] Is there a metal part? [Yes, below the glass part.]<br>
 How did they make the bulb light up? [One wire touches the bottom of the
metal part, the other wire touches the side of the metal part.]<br>
 4. Electricity travels along a path.<br>
 If the path is blocked, then electricity cannot keep flowing.<br>
 The whole path along which the electricity travels is called a circuit.<br>
 A broken path is called an open circuit.<br>
 5. Break open an old torch battery with the back of an axe.<br>
 <font color="#ff0000H">Be careful!</font><br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="6.38H"></a>6.38 Electricity conductors<br>
<a href="./images/32.2.1d.gif">See diagram: 32.2.1</a>: Electricity conductor.<br>
 Teach the children to use a test circuit to show which substances are conductors
of electricity.<br>
 Use batteries, bulb holders (not essential), pieces of wire (30 pieces 
if bulb holders are used), connecting boards, items for testing,<br>
e.g. nails, string, wood, plastic rulers, chalk, rubber, leaves.<br>
 1. Use the chalkboard diagram to show the children how to set up their
 testing circuits.<br>
 Give out the materials and tell them to set up their own circuits.<br>
 2. Trace the path of the electricity from one end of the battery to the 
other through the circuit.<br>
 Is the pathway complete? [No.]<br>
 Does the bulb light? [No.]<br>
 Put a piece of wire across the break between the two drawing pins.<br>
 What happens? [The bulb lights.]<br>
 Why? [The wire completes the pathway and allows the electricity to flow 
 through the circuit.]<br>
 3. Test each item to see if they will allow electricity to flow by placing 
 them to touch two drawing pins.<br>
 How will you know if electricity is flowing? [The light bulb glows.]<br>
 4. Divide the items into two groups.<br>
 Group 1 contains things that electricity will flow through, conductors.<br>
 Group 2 contains things that electricity will not flow through, insulators.<br>
 When all the things have been tested, fill in the table of results on the
chalkboard.<br>
 5. Most metals are good conductors of electricity, e.g. iron, tin, and 
copper are used to make wires.<br>
 Most non-metals do not conduct electricity, e.g. glass, plastic, clay, 
 rubber, wood, air.<br>
 They are called insulators and are used to stop the flow of electricity.<br>
 Can you see insulators on an electricity pole? [Yes.]<br>
 6. List conductors and insulators you can see in a home/ town.<br>
 Show the children the large white insulators on electric power poles.<br>
 Never touch power lines with sticks or the string of a kite.<br>
 Sometimes power poles will conduct electricity will conduct electricity.<br>
 If they are wet, the children should not touch them.<br>
 If you see power lines lying on the ground, you should tell people to keep
away from them and you should inform local government or<br>
 the power company.<br>

 and floating<br>
<a href="6.39.png">See diagram 6.39</a>: Plasticine floating at deepest level.<br>
 Groups of four children.<br>
 Use plasticine, jar and water.<br>
 An object that sinks can be made to float by increasing its volume so that
the weight of the object is less than the weight of the water<br>
 displaced.<br>
 One mL of water weighs close to one gram.<br>
 Make the boat by moulding the plasticine around a small jar.<br>
 Try the experiment before the lesson.<br>
 This discussion can help in explaining how ships float.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Teach the children to explain why an object that
 sinks in water can be made to float.<br>
 1. Half fill a jar with water, mark the level of the water on the side
 of the jar.<br>
 2. Make a piece of plasticine into the shape of a boat with high sides.<br>
 Float the boat in the jar of water.<br>
 What happens to the level of water in the jar? [It goes up.]<br>
 Why did the level of the water go up? [It was pushed up by the part of the
boat under the water.]<br>
 3. Now sink the boat.<br>
 What happens to the level of the water in the jar? [It drops.]<br>
 What does this new level tell you? [This is the volume of the plasticine
 used to make the boat.]<br>
 Was the volume of the plasticine greater or less than the volume of the 
floating boat? [Much less.]<br>
 What is the weight of the boat.<br>
 4. Float the boat again.<br>
 Add bits of plasticine so that it floats lower in the water.<br>
 What has happened to the level of water as the boat floated lower? [It 
rose.]<br>
 Why did it rise? [The boat has pushed out more water as it floated lower.]<br>
 Why did the boat sink down more? [It is heavier or more massive with bits
of plasticine in it.]<br>
 5. Add more plasticine until the boat is just floating.<br>
 It cannot float any lower without sinking.<br>
 What is the volume of the boat? [Equal to the volume of the water pushed
 out.]<br>
 6. Find the weight of the water pushed out.<br>
 7. Conclusion<br>
 An object floats when the weight of the object is less than the weight 
of the of the water it pushes away, displaces.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="6.40H"></a>6.40 Hanging magnets<br>
<a href="./images/29.167.gif">See diagram: 29.167</a>: Hanging bar magnet.<br>
 Teach the children to predict what will happen when hanging magnets are 
brought near each other.<br>
 You will need: Bar magnets, two for each group, thin string, pocket compass.<br>
 This lesson teaches the rule about magnetic poles: "Like poles repel, unlike
poles attract".<br>
 Hanging magnets attract and repel<br>
 1. Tie the string around each magnet and hang them away from each other.<br>
 Look at the pocket compass.<br>
 Are both hanging magnets pointing in the same direction? [Yes.]<br>
 Which way are you pointing? [North-south.]<br>
 2. Mark the north pole on each magnet with a piece of chalk.<br>
 It may already be marked with red paint or a small hole.<br>
 Tie the end of the string of one magnet to the edge of the desk so that 
 it hangs in a fixed position.<br>
 Move the north pole of the other magnet towards the north pole of the fixed
magnet.<br>
 What happens? [The north pole moves away, the poles repel each other.]<br>
 Move the south pole towards the north pole of the fixed magnet.<br>
 What happens? [They move together, the poles attract each other.]<br>
 4. Use loops of cotton to suspend two magnets freely.<br>
 Bring each pole of the two magnets close to, but not touching, each other.<br>
 Show that like poles repel and unlike poles attract.<br>
 Extra Activity: Repeat the last step, but have paper or glass between the
magnets.<br>
 Do you still attract or repel each other? [Yes.]<br>
 What does this show you about properties of magnets? [Like poles repel
 each other. Unlike poles attract each other.]<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="6.41H"></a>6.41 Electromagnets<br>
<a href="./images/32.2.1d.gif">See diagram 32.2.1</a>: Simple electromagnet.<br>
 Soft iron is used in electromagnets so the magnetism can be "turned on" 
and "turned off".<br>
 Use pieces of insulated wire, nails about 7 cm long, batteries, pins or
paper clips that can be picked up by a bar magnet.<br>
 Winding the wire on the nail.<br>
 The wire must be wound around the nail in one direction only.<br>
 It must not be crossed over and there should be about thirty turns around 
 the nail.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2">Teach the children to make simple electromagnets.<br>
 1. Give each group one piece of insulated wire, one long nail, pins and 
paper clips.<br>
 Put the nail near some pins and see if it is a magnet.<br>
 Is it a magnet? [No.]<br>
 2. Show the class how to wind a piece of wire around a nail.<br>
 Test the nail with the wire on it and see if it is a magnet.<br>
 Is it a magnet? [No.]<br>
 3. Use scissors to cut away one cm of the plastic at each end of the wire
so that the ends are bare.<br>
 Connect the ends of the wire to the battery and see if the nail with the
wire around it is a magnet now.<br>
 Is it a magnet? [Yes.] Pick up some pins with the electromagnet.<br>
 Now disconnect the wire from the battery.<br>
 Is it still a magnet? [No.]<br>
 4. The electromagnet is an important part of a petrol engine.<br>
 When electric current flows, the magnet is on, when no current flows, the
magnet is off.<br>
 Extra Activity:<br>
 What happens to the "strength" of your magnet when you use:<br>
 1. Less turns of wire around the nail? [The magnetic strength is less.]<br>
 2. Two batteries instead of one? [The magnetic strength is greater.]<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="6.42H"></a>6.42 Rain on soils<br>
 Teach the children to explain what happens when rain falls on different
 soils and different slopes.<br>
 Use a tin with holes punched in the bottom, different types of land, and
soil in two boxes.<br>
 Practice the recommended activities of making "rain" well ahead of the 
lesson.<br>
 Observe slopes and erosion.<br>
 1. Let the children practice making "rain" using tins.<br>
 2. Shake the "rain" on a slope covered in grass.<br>
 What happens to the soil? [The soil is not washed away.]<br>
 3. Shake the "rain" on sloping soil containing grass, leaves and sticks.
<br>
 What happens to the soil? [Some soil is washed away.]<br>
 4. Shake the "rain" on a slope of fine soil.<br>
 What happens to the soil? [Most of the fine soil is washed away.]<br>
 5. Put the boxes of different soils on slopes and shake the rain on them 
- sandy soil, clay soil and loam soil.<br>
 What do you see? [More soil is washed down by the rain on the steep slope.]<br>
 6. When soil is washed away, this is called erosion.<br>
 Erosion can be controlled by:<br>
 6.1 Keeping soil covered,<br>
 6.2 Not digging sloping soil,<br>
 6.3. Contour banks across slopes.<br>

<a href="./biology/UNBiol5.html#10.2.1H">10.2.1</a> Male reproductive system<br>
 Be able to describe the reproductive organs of the male and describe what
you do.<br>
 Use: Compound microscope, labelled drawings of male reproductive organs.<br>
 Keep to the words in the lesson and show the children these diagrams.<br>
 Do not draw your own diagrams.<br>
 1. We know that before a baby is born there must always be a mother and 
a father.<br>
 The mother is called the female and the father is called the male. The
 female animal makes the eggs and the male animal the sperm.<br>
 2. The sperm made by the male is very much smaller than the egg of the
 female. It can only be seen under a microscope.<br>
 A microscope makes very small things look big.<br>
 Sperm look like tiny tadpoles under the microscope.<br>
 3. Sperm are made in the testis.<br>
 There are two testes.<br>
 The sperm can get out through the penis.<br>
 Normally urine gets through the penis, but sperm can travel through it as
well.<br>
 4. Discussion on sperm.<br>
 The human male produces millions of sperm in the testes.<br>
 But only can fertilize each egg.<br>
 Why are so many sperm made<br>

<a href="./biology/UNBiol5.html#10.1.0H">10.1.0</a> Female reproduction system<br>
 Be able to describe the reproductive organs of the female and describe
 what you do.<br>
 Use: Labelled drawings of female reproductive organs, fetus and placenta.<br>
 Keep to the words in this lesson and show children the diagrams.<br>
 Do not draw your own diagrams.<br>
 1. The egg is much bigger than a sperm, but it is still very small .We can
just see it.<br>
 Eggs are made in the ovary.<br>
 There are two ovaries.<br>
 2. Once a month each ovary lets an egg go down the tubes.<br>
 If the egg is not fertilized it is washed through the uterus and out through
the vagina.<br>
 About two weeks later the lining of the uterus flows down and out through 
 the vagina.<br>
 This monthly flow of blood and uterus lining is called menstruation.<br>
 3. If an egg is fertilized by a sperm the fertilized egg sticks to the
 lining of the uterus and the baby starts to grow.<br>
 There is no menstruation until after the baby is born.<br>
 The baby is joined by the umbilical cord to the placenta.<br>
 The placenta absorbs food and oxygen from the mother and takes away the wastes from the baby.<br>
 The placenta comes out through the vagina after birth.<br>

<a href="./biology/UNBiol5.html#10.5.0H">10.5.0</a> Pregnancy<br>
 Be able to explain how babies are born and then cared for.<br>
 Use: Labelled cardboard drawings of a developing baby and associated structures, a mother caring for a new baby.<br>
 Keep to the words in the lesson and show children the diagrams, but do not draw your own diagrams on the chalkboard.<br>
 1. The baby is born nine months after fertilization.<br>
 It leaves the mother's body via the vagina.<br>
 When the baby is born the cord is still joined.<br>
 The cord is cut and died.<br>
 the cut soon heals up, but leaves a mark on the baby's body.<br>
 This mark is called the navel.<br>
 It is also called the "belly button".<br>
 2. The baby is helpless when it is born.<br>
 The mother takes care of it.<br>
 The young baby feeds on the mother's milk for a few months.<br>
 Of all the young animals the human baby is the weakest.<br>
 It is also the most helpless.<br>
 The young of other animals can walk soon after you are born.<br>
 The human baby can walk only after several months.<br>
 3. Soon after birth the baby should be put to the mother's breast to suck milk.<br>
 Breast milk is the best milk for babies and the mother should feed the baby with her milk for as many months as possible.<br>
 Bottle milk is not best for babies.<br>
 4. Animals look after your young in different ways, but all give the greatest 
love and care to your children.<br>
 The birth of a human baby is a joy to everyone.<br>
 The human baby is cared for not only by the mother, but by the whole family as well.<br>
 It receives food, shelter and protection from its parents.<br>
 The child also receives love and kindness from the family.<br>
