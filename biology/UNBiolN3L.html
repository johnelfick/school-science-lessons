<br>
Shasta daisy, (Leucanthemum x superbum), garden plant, possibly unpleasant odour, Asteraceae<br>
In the song: "Does she love me? Yes I know.<br>
For the petals of the daisy, told me so."<br>
The daisy, (from "day's eye", because its flower opens and closes every day), may be any species of family Asteraceae, formerly Compositae.<br>
The daisy flower is really a composite flower head, called a capitulum, composed of bell-shaped disk florets, which form the centre of each head, and strap-shaped ray florets extend out like petals.<br>
Each petal is actually an usually white, strap-shaped ray floret.<br>
We can count the number "petals" for each daisy, e.g. buttercup 5, delphiniums 8, iris 3, Shasta daisy 21, black-eyed Susan 13, ox-eye daisy 15 to 40.<br>
The Japanese honour, "The Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum", depicts 14 or 16 or 17 chrysanthemum petals in different heraldic crests.<br>
Use the ox-eye daisy, Leucanthemum vulgare, to pluck the petals while intoning 'she love me' or 'she loves me not' for every second petal plucked.<br>
The last petal plucked represents the truth between the object of your affection loving you or not..<br> 
If you use a buttercup with 5 petals: "| she loves me | she loves me not | she loves me | she loves me not | she loves me"", the conclusion is "She love me".<br>
But of you try it with a delphinium with 8 petals, the conclusion is "She love me not".<br>
So we must change change the song to: "Does she love me? Yes I know..<br>
For the odd-numbered petals of the daisy, told me so...<br>

Heliotropic movement of leaves is less commonly noticed or known.<br>
Heliotropism evolves in response to highly specific environmental conditions, and factors affecting flowers can be different from those impacting leaves.<br>
For leaves, heliotropism is for maximising photosynthesis, avoiding over-heating on a hot day or even reducing water loss in harsh and arid conditions.<br>
The leaves which track the sun, arrange their leaves so they are almost horizontal in the morning to capture the available sunlight.<br>
