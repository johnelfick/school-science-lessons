<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.1.1H">4.1.</a> Fermentation, Safety in school science<br>
 1. Fermentation experiments may be done out on a small or relatively large scale in a fermenter.<br>
 After initial inoculation, large numbers of microorganisms may be produced.<br>
 Using a fermenter may require electrical connection, and gases may be produced, some of which may be flammable.<br>
 Risks from fermentation can be minimized by choosing suitable organisms and techniques, using safe ways of handling suitable microorganisms , and keeping the volume of the medium to a practical minimum.<br>
 2. Microorganisms particularly suitable for studying fermentation technology at school level are yoghurt making bacteria, strains of non-pathogenic yeast, and some unicellular algae, e.g. wine yeast, beer yeast, bread making yeast, dried yoghurt cultures.<br>
 3. For work at a more advanced level, it is recommended that only microorganisms with unusual growth needs are used, e.g. microorganisms requiring high salt, acid conditions, low or high temperatures, i.e. as far away from 37<sup>o</sup>C as possible, to encourage growth of the "intended" organism at the expense of undesirable 
 contaminants.<br>
 Bacteria with unusual growth needs include: <i>Vibrio nutriegens</i>, (<i>Beneckea nutriegens</i>), <i>Photobacterium phosphoreum</i>, <a href="../biology/UNBiol8.html#AcetobacterH"><i>Acetobacter aceti</i>.</a>.<br>
 4. Organisms other than those listed above may be used, but only if the teacher responsible has had appropriate training in microbiological techniques, i.e. giving a good knowledge of aseptic techniques, subculturing, recognition of contamination, and safe disposal.<br>
 5. Cultures should be obtained only from recognized specialist UK schools suppliers.<br>
 Cultures should never be exchanged between schools, colleges, and other institutions.<br>
 Maintenance beyond two or three subcultures should be done only if those involved have had training in the necessary techniques.<br>
 The use of suitable techniques is particularly critical when working with fermentation.<br>
 Prepared and sterilized media and equipment must be used.<br>
 Aseptic technique must be used when inoculating the fermenter and when taking samples.<br>
The volume of actively growing inoculum should be a significant fraction of the volume of the medium, e.g. 20% so that any chance of contaminant getting in during the inoculation procedure has to compete with an established organism.<br>
<a href="../biology/UNBiol8.html#AcetobacterH">Acetobacter</a>.<br>
6. Question<br>
"I have some of my 12s investigating the effect of temperature on carrying capacity of yeast.<br>
Does anyone know if/where I find guidelines regarding the maximum temperature they can use to incubate their yeast cultures?<br>
Iâ€™ve seen somewhere at some point details re: risk of growing pathogenic bacteria."<br>
Answer<br>
"If you set the cultures up similar to a fermentation practical, you should not have any issues with unwanted pathogens.<br>
Sterile glassware + CO2 atmosphere.<br>
Yeast is quite tolerant of temperature and will grow at +40oC (I think up to 47oC). The ideal is 35 - 37oC.<br>
A large number of pathogens will not tolerate >42oC."<br>
"How are they going to measure the growth rate?<br>
 Turbidity or cultures?"<br>
"A simpler option might be the concentration of glucose in the medium.<br>
They could then record endpoint turbidity."<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.1.2H">4.1.2</a> Spillage, Safety in school science<br>
 When using fermenters, it is also important to remember that relatively large volumes of potentially hazardous substances, e.g. antibiotics, enzymes, pesticides, or growth substances, can be produced, posing problems for dealing with spillages or safe disposal.<br>
 Spillages should be avoided, and if they happen, need to be carefully managed.<br>
 Materials and equipment must be safely sterilized and disposed of after use.<br>
 Any spillages must be cleared up immediately using a suitable disinfectant, e.g. clear phenolic, Clearsol, Hycolin, Putitol, Steticol, Sudol.<br>
 All disinfectants should be freshly prepared, and used at manufacturers' recommended dilutions.<br>
 Spills on clothing may be best disinfected using a surface active disinfectant, e.g. Harris "BAS clean" and "Griffin ASAB".<br>
 Any spillage may cause the formation of an aerosol that may remain for some time.<br>
 If a gross spillage occurs, the laboratory should be cleared immediately and that all accidental microbiological spillage incidents should be recorded.<br>
 Aerosols are fine sprays or suspensions that, in this context, contain microorganisms .<br>
 The scale of liquid culture involved may increase the chance of any contaminant being cultured in large numbers and then being released back into the environment by the formation and escape of aerosols.<br>
 A fermenter must be adequately vented to prevent the build up of pressure in the vessel.<br>
 For work with yeast and similar organisms, a wine making trap or strong non-absorbent cotton wool plug attached to the air vent should be sufficient to trap any fine spray.<br>
 The use of in-line microbiological filter cartridges should be considered.<br>
 In solid culture fermentation, e.g. cheese, tempeh, there is the possibility of fungal spores being produced in quantities sufficient to produce sensitization and possible allergic reactions.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.1.3H">4.1.3</a> Electrical safety, Safety in school science<br>
 Fermenters must heated and stirred, and much useful information can be gained by the use of monitoring equipment ranging from stand-alone instruments to computer data logging packages.<br>
 However, most of these will be at less than 20 volts, which is relatively safe.<br>
 Care should be taken to keep mains and other leads tidy, and it is clearly wise to site electrical equipment as far as is possible from the fermenter vessel and wet working areas.<br>
 Mains powered equipment, e.g. pH meter, used with a fermenter should be of a reputable design intended for school use.<br>
 Where apparatus other than purely proprietary devices intended for continuous operation, e.g. incubators, is left running out of school time, then it should bear a warning notice.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.1.4H">4.1.4</a> Biogas, Safety in school science<br>
 Some schools are interested in investigating "biogas" generation by the fermentation of silage or grass clippings.<br>
 Methane is produced slowly when the mixture is inoculated by the addition of well rotted garden compost or rich pond mud and the presence of broad bean husks is helpful.<br>
 Such procedures are acceptable, provided the methane is handled with the care, because of a flammable gas.<br>
 However, this document does not recommend the use of animal manure as an inoculum, although of course it is widely used for fuel gas production.<br>
 While many people handle horse manure in stables or when gardening, deliberate culturing in a fermenter may introduce unacceptable risks of infection, e.g. from <i>Salmonella</i> species.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.1.5H">4.1.5</a> Disposal, Safety in school science<br>
 See: <a href="../commercial/Commercial.html#Autoclaves>Autoclaves</a>, (Commercial).<br>
 All cultures and their containers, e.g. Petri dishes, should be sterilized using an autoclave or pressure cooker before disposal.<br>
 The culture medium can be then poured away down a sink, and flushed down with a large volume of water.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.1.6H">4.1.6</a> Antibiotics, penicillin, Safety in school science<br>
 Antibiotics can cause allergic reactions, so penicillin-producing cultures should not be used in schools.<br>
 Culturing of large quantities of any micro-organism that produces an antibiotic could be hazardous.<br>
 There is growing concern over the promiscuous use of antibiotics and the increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistant strains of microorganisms .<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.1.7H">4.1.7</a> Plant growth substances, Safety in school science<br>
 Plant growth substances, known wrongly as plant hormones, are extensively used both in growth investigations and in plant tissue culture.<br>
 Many are toxic and a few may also be carcinogenic.<br>
They are normally used in very low concentrations in experiments and media.<br>
Technicians and teachers handling solids or more concentrated solutions should be aware of the hazards, and take appropriate precautions, e.g. by wearing disposable gloves.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.1.8H">4.1.8</a> Enzymes, Safety in school science<br>
 Hazards from enzymes are associated with their increased use both in quantity and variety.<br>
 Teachers and technicians should be aware of the hazards involved in handling enzymes in solid and liquid form, to avoid spillage and the formation of aerosols.<br>
 Enzymes are biologically active proteins, which can irritate the skin or eyes and cause allergic reactions.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.1.9H">4.1.9</a> Animal tissue culture, Safety in school science<br>
 Practical, work with animal tissue cultures is not recommended for use in schools, because of the risk of serious infection.<br>
 If such work is to be done, ensure that the culture is obtained from a recognized specialist UK schools supplier.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.1.10H">4.1.10</a> Genetic Engineering, Safety in school science<br>
Experiments called "genetic engineering" should not be done in schools.<br>
However, "genetic engineering" is a loose and somewhat general term.<br>
The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) regulations and guidance adopt a more precise definition of the term "genetic manipulation."<br> 
"Genetic manipulation" is defined by HSE as: (the) formation of new combinations of heritable material by the insertion of nucleic acid molecules, produced by whatever means outside the cell, into any virus, bacterial plasmid, or other vector system so as to allow their incorporation into a host organism in which they do not naturally occur, but in which they are capable of continued propagation.<br>
Scientists have used genetic engineering to try to find whether an organism linked to a disease had been genetically modified and where it had come from, e.g. SARS-CoV-2.<br>

 Following containment procedures:<br>
 1. The laboratory door must be kept closed, except as needed for access.<br>
 No special laboratory design or special containment equipment is required to work with Biosafety Level 1 organisms.<br>
 2. There is to be no eating, drinking, smoking, or storage of food in the laboratory.<br>
 3. Workers must wash their hands thoroughly after handling organisms, and upon leaving the laboratory.<br>
 4. Do not use a pipette and filler by mouth.<br>
 Only use a mechanical pipette and filler device.<br>
 5. Take special care to avoid skin contamination with potentially biohazardous organisms.<br>
 Wear gloves when skin contact with the agent is unavoidable.<br>
 6. Avoid use of hypodermic needles and syringes when alternative methods are available.<br>
 Take care to minimize the creation of aerosols or splatters that occur when a hot loop or needle is inserted into a culture, an inoculating loop is flamed so that it splatters, or fluids are forcefully 
 ejected from pipette and fillers and syringes.<br>
 7. Separate biological waste from office trash and general laboratory trash.<br>
 8. Collect solid and liquid biological waste in specially marked containers, e.g. autoclave plastic bags or biosafety disposal bags, and disinfect by with autoclave or pressure cooker or by treatment with a solution of household bleach.<br>
 The containers should be airtight and must be secured tightly and marked with tape that reads "AUTOCLAVED after with autoclave or pressure cooker.<br>
 9. Solutions useful for decontamination include chlorine-based disinfectants, which are effective against vegetative bacteria, most viruses, and fungi at 500 ppm.<br>
 Clorox or Purex diluted at 1: 100 provide the necessary concentrations.<br>
 A dilution of 1: 20 yields 2500 ppm, which will also kill bacterial spores.<br>
 Ethanol 70% in water is effective against vegetative bacteria and nonlipid-containing viruses and is effective for surface decontamination.<br>
 10. Solid trash that has been contaminated by biological waste must be collected in a separate, specially marked disposal bag, see step 8.<br>
 Package all sharp instruments, e.g. needles or scalpel blades inside the container, in separate cardboard containers or in other available containers for disposal.<br>
 No pipette and fillers should protrude from the disposal bag.<br>
 Free liquids and gels must be absorbed by paper towels to minimize the risk of leakage.<br>
 The bags must be secured tightly, and tape that shows the word "AUTOCLAVED" after with autoclave or pressure cooker must be clearly visible on the bags.<br>
 11. Contaminated materials that are to be decontaminated at a site away from the laboratory must be placed in a durable, leak-proof container that is closed before removal from the laboratory.<br>
 Contaminated materials that are to be reused should be decontaminated before washing.<br>
 12. Laboratory workers, students, and teachers must clean and decontaminate work surfaces with 70% ethanol.<br>
 Those individuals also are responsible for the decontamination of biological material spills, removing contaminated supplies (such as pipette and fillers and syringes) from floors, and decontamination of contaminated floor surfaces.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.3.01H">4.3.01</a> "Ten Rules for Safe Microbiology and Biotechnology in School"<br>
by Eckhard R. Lucius, IPN, Kiel, Germany, UNESCO / IUBS (edited)<br>
See: <a href="../commercial/Commercial.html#AutoclavesH">Autoclaves</a>, (Commercial).<br>
 In the Federal Republic of Germany, the safety of scientific teaching 
 is governed by guidelines set out by the Ministers of Education.<br>
 The code of conduct that generally applies to scientific experiments
 is expounded here, e.g. no eating, drinking, or smoking in 
 laboratories, chemicals should not be tasted, hands should be washed, 
 pipetting should not be done using the mouth.<br>
 The IPN, Institute for Science Education, recommends that the following
 ten rules should also be observed for microbiological and 
 biotechnical experiments:<br>
 1. Pure cultures of microorganisms suitable for use in schools should
 be ordered from the DSM (international: from the ATCC: 
 American Type Culture Collection).<br>
 2. Enrichment plates of microorganisms from the environment should be
 sealed by sticking the slit between the base and lid of the 
 Petri dish together with clear adhesive tape.<br>
 3. Bacteriological experiments with faecal material ("biogas from sewage 
 sludge") should not be done in schools.<br>
 4. Work in sterile conditions, i.e. nutrient solutions should not only
 be boiled, but sterilized in a pressure cooker or autoclave.<br>
 Glass equipment or pipette and fillers that come into contact with sterile 
 solutions should be sterilized for 30 minutes in a drying 
 cupboard at 18<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 5. Colonies of mould that have formed spores should not be examined under
 the microscope without using Petri slides.<br>
 6. Do not use antibiotics from a pharmacy for school science experiments
 to avoid increasing resistance to antibiotics on prescription.<br>
 7. Use disposable Petri dishes instead of glass Petri dishes.<br>
 8. Mouth pipetting should never be employed.<br>
 A piston device should be used to draw the liquid up the pipette and
 filler instead of a rubber bulb.<br>
 9. Do not leave bacterial cultures that are no longer required lying
 around.<br>
 Old cultures should be destroyed in a pressure cooker and disposed of.<br>
 10. Only use microbial nucleic acids if they occur naturally in the organism
 (in vivo DNA).<br>
 Do not use genetically engineered material (in vitro DNA).<br>

 See: <a href="../commercial/Commercial.html#SyringesH">Syringes</a>, (Commercial).<br>
 1. Do not use human or other animal materials as sources of microorganisms .<br>
 You may isolate a human pathogen and in the culturing process produce 
 many millions of these cells.<br>
 2. Treat all organisms as "potential pathogens" by following the safety 
 guidelines.<br>
 People who are immuno-compromised are at risk and in experiments in which
 you are growing cultures.<br>
 Many millions of cells are concentrated in a way not found in the environment.<br>
 3. Do not do experiments using antibiotic discs, because you may succeed 
 in producing antibiotic-resistant bacteria.<br>
 The range of antibiotics available for medical use is limited and pathogenic 
 bacteria resistant to these could become a major problem.<br>
 4. Do not expose Petri dishes in toilet areas or allow students to cough 
 or sneeze over them.<br>
 5. Do not eat, drink or smoke in the laboratory.<br>
 Do not touch a plate or unsterilized loop with the fingers, pencils or
 pens, but use disposable gloves.<br>
 6. Do not pipette and filler bacterial cultures by mouth.<br>
 7. Laboratory coats or gowns or aprons should be worn by everyone working 
 with bacterial cultures so that the coat can be removed 
 and sterilized if there is any accidental spillage or contamination.<br>
 8. All people working in the laboratory must wash their hands in a disinfectant 
 solution diluted to the recommended concentration or 
 with a disinfectant soap upon contamination and before leaving the laboratory.<br>
 9. Swab down all working surfaces when the practical session is completed, 
 using disinfectant diluted to the recommended concentration.<br>
 Provide this in a bucket, with a "Wettex" cloth kept for this purpose.<br>
 10. Flood spills with disinfectant and leave to stand for one minute.<br>
 Mop up with "Wettex" from the bench swab bucket.<br>
 Wash hands with disinfectant soap or solution.<br>
 11. Replace all disinfectant solutions at the end of each day.<br>
 12. When exposing microbial cultures to the atmosphere, always work within
 the safety zone of a Bunsen burner flame.<br>
 This zone extends 15 cm around the flame.<br>
 Any cells that may escape from the cultures, suspensions or bacteriological 
 loop in the form of an aerosol will be drawn into the flame 
 by the convection currents surrounding the flame and be destroyed.<br>
 13. Incubate cultures at room temperature, or a temperature close to
 the original environment of the organism.<br>
 If you wish to hurry the culture along, try 30<sup>o</sup>C to 34<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 Use disinfectant diluted to the recommended concentration.<br>
 Provide this in a bucket, with a Wettex cloth kept for this purpose.<br>
 To avoid culturing pathogens, do not use of 37<sup>o</sup>C as an incubation 
 temperature, because 37<sup>o</sup>C is the normal human temperature.<br>
 14. Seal Petri dishes after inoculation by taping the circumference with
 clear adhesive tape.<br>
 The lids must not be removed when the students examine the cultures.<br>
 15. Discard wastes as follows:<br>
 15.1 Discard waste paper in a bin or garbage can for burning.<br>
 15.2 Discard slides into a jar of disinfectant.<br>
 15.3 Discard pipette and fillers and swab sticks into a cylinder of 
disinfectant.<br>
 15.4 Discard plastic equipment by autoclave, or sterilize in a pressure 
 cooker follow the manufacturer's instructions.<br>
 The equipment will be destroyed by the treatment and may be incinerated 
 after being sterilized.<br>
 Sterilize plastic equipment separately from glassware.<br>
 15.5 Discard glass equipment.<br>
 Use the autoclave or sterilize in a pressure cooker before cleaning out
 the material, then wash normally and store until next time.<br>

 1. Two days before the experiment, inoculate a culture of <i>Bacillus 
 subtilis</i> in nutrient broth and incubate at 25<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 Remove the top from the bottle containing the culture of Bacillus subtilis.<br>
 Pass the neck through a Bunsen burner flame three times.<br>
 Remove a few drops of culture with the sterile dropping pipette and filler.<br>
 Flame the bottle neck again and replace the top.<br>
 Have in store a Universal bottle of melted nutrient agar, kept at 45-50<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 Prepare and label Universal bottles 1.1 to 1.3 and beaker 1.4.<br>
 Bottle 1.1 contains 10 mL of antiseptic solution, e.g. TCP, Dettol.<br>
 Bottle 1.2 contains 9 mL deionized water + 1 mL from bottle 1.1.<br>
 Bottle 1.3 contains 9 mL deionized water + 1 mL from bottle 1.2.<br>
 Beaker 1.4 contains deionized water.<br>
 2. Lift the lid of the Petri dish and place 5 drops of the culture in 
 the centre of the dish and replace the lid.<br>
 Remove the cap of the bottle of melted nutrient agar.<br>
 Pass the neck of the bottle through a Bunsen burner flame three times, 
 pour the contents into the Petri dish and replace the lid.<br>
 Mix the contents of the Petri dish with a sterile glass spreader, moving 
 in a figure of eight, but avoiding any splashing over the edge.<br>
 Let the agar set to form a pour plate.<br>
 3. Use a pipette and filler and filler to transfer 9 mL of deionized
 water to empty bottles 1.2 and 1.3.<br>
 Use the same pipette and filler to transfer 1 mL of antiseptic, e.g.
 TCP or Dettol, from bottle 1.1 to bottle 1.2.<br>
 Gently shake bottle 1.2 to mix the contents, then transfer 1 mL from
 bottle 1.2 to bottle 1.3.<br>
 When the agar has set, invert the agar and use a marker pen to divide 
 the base into four sections by drawing a cross.<br>
 Label the sections 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4 then invert the Petri dish again
 so the starch nutrient agar is up.<br>
 Using flamed forceps, dip a paper disc into 1.4, the beaker of deionized 
 water.<br>
 Drain excess liquid from it, then place it on section 1.4 of the agar.<br>
 Flame forceps.<br>
 Replace the lid as soon as possible.<br>
 Repeat for the other three sections using the samples in the order 1.3, 
 1.2, 1.1.<br>
 Do not invert the Petri dish.<br>
 Incubate the Petri dish at 20-25<sup>o</sup>C overnight.<br>
 4. Examine the agar plate.<br>
 Use a sheet of graph paper to record the diameter of clear areas around 
 the discs.<br>
 Be careful! Do not open the Petri dish.<br>
 Sterilize contaminated materials and equipment by incineration or with 
 autoclave or pressure cooker.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.1.2.5H">4.1.2.5</a> Prepare heat-fixed stained bacterial smears.<br>
 1. Test a microscope slide for cleanliness by spreading a loop full 
of water across the glass.<br>
 If the water does not spread evenly, you must clean the slide with a
 powder cleanser, rinse in tap water and dry.<br>
 Repeat 1. Put the slide and culture near the base of the flame.<br>
 2. If the culture is a broth, aseptically remove a loop full of suspension
 from the bottle.<br>
 Spread the inoculum for 2 cm in the centre of the slide.<br>
 3. If the culture is a colony on a plate, select an isolated colony.<br>
 Place a loop full of tap water on the centre of the slide.<br>
 Aseptically, cut the colony with the edge of the loop and mix the inoculum 
 into the drop of water to give an even suspension.<br>
 With the flat of the loop, spread the suspension 4 cm on the slide.<br>
 4. Allow the smear to air dry until barely visible.<br>
 1. Pass the smear quickly through the flame 3 times.<br>
 Check that the slide is not becoming too hot by holding it on the back
 of your hand between passes through the flame.<br>
 If you overheat the cells they will distort and burst.<br>
 Passing the slide through the flame is called heat-fixing of the cells, because the heat melts the sugars in the cell wall and causes them to 
 stick to the glass.<br>
 For this type of smear, you do not need a coverslip.<br>
 6. Place the heat-fixed smear on a stain rack over a sink and flood 
with either crystal violet or safranin.<br>
 Leave to stand for 1-2 minutes.<br>
 7. Wash off the excess stain with water and tap the slide as dry as possible
 on the rack.<br>
 Fold the slide inside paper towelling and blot dry, but do not rub! Allow
 the slide to air dry completely before placing on the microscope 
 stage.<br>

 1. When working with microbial cultures always work within the safety 
 zone of a Bunsen flame.<br>
 2. Place the inoculum, the bacteriological loop and the labelled inverted 
 NA plate near the base of the flame.<br>
 Check that the lid of the inoculation bottle is loose.<br>
 3. Take up the loop and sterilize by heating in the flame.<br>
 Remove the loop, but hold it beside the flame for 5-10 seconds to allow 
 it to cool.<br>
 4. Take up the inoculation bottle in the other hand and hold the lid
 with the little finger on the loop hand.<br>
 Rotate the bottle to remove the lid and keep hold of the lid so that
 it does not touch the bench.<br>
 1. Pass the top of the bottle through the flame and insert the loop 
into the suspension.<br>
 6. Remove the loop, reflame the bottle and twist the bottle back onto 
 its lid.<br>
 Place the bottle aside on the bench.<br>
 7. Pick up the agar plate by the base and expose the surface to the 
flame.<br>
 8. Spread the inoculum over 1/ 4 of the surface of the plate by a series 
 of sideways strokes of the loop back and forth across the agar.<br>
 9. Place the plate back on its lid and reflame the loop.<br>
 Rotate the plate 75<sup>o</sup> clockwise, for a right-handed person.<br>
 10. When the loop has cooled, lift up the plate and angle it to the 
flame so that you can see where the initial inoculum was spread.<br>
 11. Prepare 4 strokes of the loop out of the initial inoculum across
 the surface of the agar.<br>
 Note that the inoculum being spread has been greatly diluted.<br>
 Again rotate the plate about 75 degrees clockwise.<br>
 12. Repeat the procedure a further 3 times, but at the end of each series 
 of strokes remember to replace the plate on its lid, rotate the 
 plate and reflame the loop.<br>
 13. If none of the final streaks recrosses the initial inoculum, the
 suspension will have been diluted to the point where single cells were 
 deposited on the surface.<br>
 Each of these cells upon growth will give rise to a purified colony of
 the original.<br>

 An aliquot is a portion, a known fraction of the whole sample.<br>
 For counting the bacteria on cereals, bread and pasta the product to
 be investigated is mixed with a sterile physiological solution in and 
 a decimal dilution series is prepared from this initial suspension.<br>
 Aliquots of the dilution stages are transferred to Petri dishes and mixed
 with a still liquid culture medium.<br>
 After the agar solidifies the individual bacterial cells are fixed in 
 place and can multiply during incubation and to form colonies.<br>
 The number of colonies is counted as the number of bacteria per gram of the sample.<br>
 The accuracy of the method depends whether it is possible to separate 
 completely the bacterial cells from the substrate, avoid damage 
 to the cells during the necessary handling and get an even distribution 
 of the cells in the culture medium.<br>

 Tensides are surface active substances, which by reducing the surface 
 energy of water mediate the wetting of surfaces or promote that 
 substances insoluble in water can be emulated or dispersed in it.<br>
 Besides washing and cleaning agents, important fields of application
 of tensides are the use as additive in paints/ varnishes, in metal 
 processing fluids, in construction products as well as in paper manufacturing 
 and processing, polymer materials and plant protection 
 products.<br>
 Synthetic alkylphenol ethoxylates, commonly used as non ionic tensides, 
 are a group of non-ionic surface active substances.<br>
 During degradation in wastewater treatment plants and in the environment, 
 nonylphenols are formed, which are only slowly degradable, 
 bioaccumulative and very toxic for aquatic organisms.<br>
 Besides that, hormone like effects have been observed in fish.<br>
 Nonylphenol ethoxylates have been widely substituted in household and 
 industrial cleaners as well as in flocculates.<br>
