<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.1.1H">4.1.1</a> Animal tissue culture, Safety in school science<br>
 Animal tissue cultures is not recommended for use in schools, because of the risk of serious infection.<br>
 If such work is to be done, ensure that the culture is obtained from a recognized specialist UK schools supplier.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.1.2H">4.1.2</a> Antibiotics, penicillin, Safety in school science<br>
 Antibiotics can cause allergic reactions, so penicillin-producing cultures should not be used in schools.<br>
 Culturing of large quantities of any micro-organism that produces an antibiotic could be hazardous.<br>
 There is growing concern over the promiscuous use of antibiotics and the increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistant strains of microorganisms .<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.1.3H">4.1.3</a> Bacteria and fungi NOT suitable for use in schools<br>
Bacteria not suitable<br>
Bacillus cereus causes food poisoning.<br>
Chromobacterium violaceum, rare, causes food poisoning, produces Violacein, C20H13N3O3<br>
Clostridium perfringens causes gas gangrene<br>
Clostridium perfringens is the most common cause of food poioning in USA.<br>
Clostridium tetani produces muscle rigidity and hypersympathetic activity leading to tetanus.<br>
Photobacterium phosporeum can emit a blue-green light due to the production of the luciferase enzyme, C18H19N5O.<br>
Proteus vulgaris causes urinary tract infections, especially in hospital patients with indwelling catheters.<br>
Pseudomonas acruginosa can cause infections from wet areas, batrh tubs.<br>
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is said to be responsible for one-in-ten hospital-acquired infections<br> 
Ralstonia solanacearum causes bacterial wilt of potatoes.<br>
Pseudomonas tabaci causes wilfire disease in tobaco plants.<br> 
Serratia marcescens from bathtubs, sinks, toilets, can cause urinary tract infections.<br>
Staphylococcus aureus can cause skin infection with boils and blood poisoning.<br>
Vibrio fischeri is a non-pathogenic organism but is related to pathogenicVibrio species.<br>
Xanthomonas phaseoli causes bean blight in beans.<br>
Fungi not suitable<br>
Rhizomucor pusillus, is a pathogen to humans and animals<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.1.4H">4.1.4</a> Biogas, Safety in school science<br>
Biogas generation by the fermentation of silage or grass clippings has interested some school.<br> 
Methane is produced slowly when the mixture is inoculated by the addition of well rotted garden compost or rich pond mud.<br> 
The presence of broad bean husks is helpful.<br>
 Such procedures are acceptable, provided the methane is handled with the care, because it is a flammable gas.<br>
 However, this document does not recommend the use of animal manure as an inoculum, although it is widely used for fuel gas production.<br>
 Gardeners handle horse manure in stables or when gardening, ut deliberate culturing in a fermenter may introduce unacceptable risks of infection, e.g. from (Salmonella) species.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.1.5H">4.1.5</a> "Biosafety"<br>
Packaging gases, propellants, food additives: <a href="../topics/topic19a.html#19.4.22H">19.4.22</a><br>
 Biosafety procedures:<br>
 1. The laboratory door must be kept closed, except as needed for access.<br>
 No special laboratory design or special containment equipment is required to work with Biosafety Level 1 organisms.<br>
 2. There is to be no eating, drinking, smoking, or storage of food in the laboratory.<br>
 3. Workers must wash their hands thoroughly after handling organisms, and upon leaving the laboratory.<br>
 4. Do not use a pipette and filler by mouth.<br>
 Only use a mechanical pipette and filler device.<br>
 5. Take special care to avoid skin contamination with potentially biohazardous organisms.<br>
 Wear gloves when skin contact with the agent is unavoidable.<br>
 6. Avoid use of hypodermic needles and syringes when alternative methods are available.<br>
 Take care to minimize the creation of aerosols or splatters that occur when a hot loop or needle is inserted into a culture, an inoculating loop is flamed so that it splatters, or fluids are forcefully 
 ejected from pipette and fillers and syringes.<br>
 7. Separate biological waste from office trash and general laboratory trash.<br>
 8. Collect solid and liquid biological waste in specially marked containers, e.g. autoclave plastic bags or biosafety disposal bags, and disinfect by with autoclave or pressure cooker or by treatment with a solution of household bleach.<br>
<a href="https://www.teaching.com.au/search?action=search&q=Autoclave">Autoclaves</a> (Modern Teaching Aids)<br>
 The containers should be airtight and must be secured tightly and marked with tape that reads "AUTOCLAVED after with autoclave or pressure cooker.<br>
 9. Solutions useful for decontamination include chlorine-based disinfectants, which are effective against vegetative bacteria, most viruses, and fungi at 500 ppm.<br>
 Clorox or Purex diluted at 1: 100 provide the necessary concentrations.<br>
 A dilution of 1: 20 yields 2500 ppm, which will also kill bacterial spores.<br>
 Ethanol 70% in water is effective against vegetative bacteria and nonlipid-containing viruses and is effective for surface decontamination.<br>
 10. Solid trash that has been contaminated by biological waste must be collected in a separate, specially marked disposal bag, see step 8.<br>
 Package all sharp instruments, e.g. needles or scalpel blades inside the container, in separate cardboard containers or in other available containers for disposal.<br>
 No pipette and fillers should protrude from the disposal bag.<br>
 Free liquids and gels must be absorbed by paper towels to minimize the risk of leakage.<br>
 The bags must be secured tightly, and tape that shows the word "AUTOCLAVED" after with autoclave or pressure cooker must be clearly visible on the bags.<br>
<a href="https://www.teaching.com.au/search?action=search&q=Autoclave">Autoclaves</a> (Modern Teaching Aids)<br>
 11. Contaminated materials that are to be decontaminated at a site away from the laboratory must be placed in a durable, leak-proof container that is closed before removal from the laboratory.<br>
 Contaminated materials that are to be reused should be decontaminated before washing.<br>
 12. Laboratory workers, students, and teachers must clean and decontaminate work surfaces with 70% ethanol.<br>
 Those individuals also are responsible for the decontamination of biological material spills, removing contaminated supplies (such as pipette and fillers and syringes) from floors, and decontamination of contaminated floor surfaces.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.1.6H">4.1.6</a> Disposal, Safety in school science<br>
<a href="https://www.teaching.com.au/search?action=search&q=Autoclave">Autoclaves</a> (Modern Teaching Aids)<br>
 Disposal of all cultures and their containers, e.g. Petri dishes, should be sterilized using an autoclave or pressure cooker before disposal.<br>
 The culture medium can be then poured away down a sink, and flushed down with a large volume of water.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.1.7H">4.1.7</a> Electrical safety, Safety in school science<br>
Electrical safety when using fermenters<br>
 Fermenters must heated and stirred, and much useful information can be gained by the use of monitoring equipment ranging from stand-alone instruments to computer data logging packages.<br>
 However, most of these will be at less than 20 volts, which is relatively safe.<br>
 Care should be taken to keep mains and other leads tidy, and it is clearly wise to site electrical equipment as far as is possible from the fermenter vessel and wet working areas.<br>
 Mains powered equipment, e.g. pH meter, used with a fermenter should be of a reputable design intended for school use.<br>
 Where apparatus other than purely proprietary devices intended for continuous operation, e.g. incubators, is left running out of school time, then it should bear a warning notice.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.1.8H">4.1.8</a> Enzymes, Safety in school science<br>
 Hazards from enzymes are associated with their increased use both in quantity and variety.<br>
 Teachers and technicians should be aware of the hazards involved in handling enzymes in solid and liquid form, to avoid spillage and the formation of aerosols.<br>
 Enzymes are biologically active proteins, which can irritate the skin or eyes and cause allergic reactions.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.1.9H">4.1.9</a> Fermentation, Safety in school science<br>
 1. Fermentation experiments may be done out on a small or relatively large scale in a fermenter.<br>
 After initial inoculation, large numbers of microorganisms may be produced.<br>
 Using a fermenter may require electrical connection, and gases may be produced, some of which may be flammable.<br>
 Risks from fermentation can be minimized by choosing suitable organisms and techniques, using safe ways of handling suitable microorganisms , and keeping the volume of the medium to a practical minimum.<br>
 2. Microorganisms particularly suitable for studying fermentation technology at school level are yoghurt making bacteria, strains of non-pathogenic yeast, and some unicellular algae, e.g. wine yeast, beer yeast, bread making yeast, dried yoghurt cultures.<br>
 3. For work at a more advanced level, it is recommended that only microorganisms with unusual growth needs are used, e.g. microorganisms requiring high salt, acid conditions, low or high temperatures, i.e. as far away from 37<sup>o</sup>C as possible, to encourage growth of the "intended" organism at the expense of undesirable 
 contaminants.<br>
 Bacteria with unusual growth needs include: (Vibrio nutriegens), ((Beneckea nutriegens)), (Photobacterium phosphoreum), <a href="../biology/UNBiol8.html#AcetobacterH">(Acetobacter aceti).</a>.<br>
 4. Organisms other than those listed above may be used, but only if the teacher responsible has had appropriate training in microbiological techniques, i.e. giving a good knowledge of aseptic techniques, subculturing, recognition of contamination, and safe disposal.<br>
 5. Cultures should be obtained only from recognized specialist UK schools suppliers.<br>
 Cultures should never be exchanged between schools, colleges, and other institutions.<br>
 Maintenance beyond two or three subcultures should be done only if those involved have had training in the necessary techniques.<br>
 The use of suitable techniques is particularly critical when working with fermentation.<br>
 Prepared and sterilized media and equipment must be used.<br>
 Aseptic technique must be used when inoculating the fermenter and when taking samples.<br>
The volume of actively growing inoculum should be a significant fraction of the volume of the medium, e.g. 20% so that any chance of contaminant getting in during the inoculation procedure has to compete with an established organism.<br>

6. Question<br>
"I have some of my 12s investigating the effect of temperature on carrying capacity of yeast.<br>
Does anyone know if/where I find guidelines regarding the maximum temperature they can use to incubate their yeast cultures?<br>
I’ve seen somewhere at some point details re: risk of growing pathogenic bacteria."<br>
Answer<br>
"If you set the cultures up similar to a fermentation practical, you should not have any issues with unwanted pathogens.<br>
Sterile glassware + CO2 atmosphere.<br>
Yeast is quite tolerant of temperature and will grow at +40oC (I think up to 47oC). The ideal is 35 - 37oC.<br>
A large number of pathogens will not tolerate >42oC."<br>
"How are they going to measure the growth rate?<br>
 Turbidity or cultures?"<br>
"A simpler option might be the concentration of glucose in the medium.<br>
They could then record endpoint turbidity."<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.1.10H">4.1.10</a> Genetic engineering, Safety in school science<br>
Genetic engineering experiments should not be done in schools.<br>
However, "genetic engineering" is a loose and somewhat general term.<br>
The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) regulations and guidance adopt a more precise definition of the term "genetic manipulation."<br> 
"Genetic manipulation" is defined by HSE as: (the) formation of new combinations of heritable material by the insertion of nucleic acid molecules, produced by whatever means outside the cell, into any virus, bacterial plasmid, or other vector system so as to allow their incorporation into a host organism in which they do not naturally occur, but in which they are capable of continued propagation.<br>
Scientists have used genetic engineering to try to find whether an organism linked to a disease had been genetically modified and where it had come from, e.g. SARS-CoV-2.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.1.11H">4.1.11</a> Plant growth substances, Safety in school science<br>
 Plant growth substances, known wrongly as plant hormones, are extensively used both in growth investigations and in plant tissue culture.<br>
 Many are toxic and a few may also be carcinogenic.<br>
They are normally used in very low concentrations in experiments and media.<br>
Technicians and teachers handling solids or more concentrated solutions should be aware of the hazards, and take appropriate precautions, e.g. by wearing disposable gloves.<br>
 
 <hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.1.12H">4.1.12</a> "Safety in the microbiology laboratory"<br>
by Eleanor Gough, Australian Science Teachers Journal Vol. 33, No. 3. (edited)<br>
Microbiology laboratory safety rules .<br>
 1. Do not use human or other animal materials as sources of microorganisms.<br>
 You may isolate a human pathogen and in the culturing process produce many millions of these cells.<br>
 2. Treat all organisms as "potential pathogens" by following the safety guidelines.<br>
 People who are immuno-compromised are at risk and in experiments in which you are growing cultures.<br>
 Many millions of cells are concentrated in a way not found in the environment.<br>
 3. Do not do experiments using antibiotic discs, because you may succeed in producing antibiotic-resistant bacteria.<br>
 The range of antibiotics available for medical use is limited and pathogenic bacteria resistant to these could become a major problem.<br>
 4. Do not expose Petri dishes in toilet areas or allow students to cough or sneeze over them.<br>
 5. Do not eat, drink or smoke in the laboratory.<br>
 Do not touch a plate or unsterilized loop with the fingers, pencils or pens, but use disposable gloves.<br>
 6. Do not pipette and filler bacterial cultures by mouth.<br>
 7. Laboratory coats or gowns or aprons should be worn by everyone working with bacterial cultures so that the coat can be removed and sterilized if there is any accidental spillage or contamination.<br>
 8. All people working in the laboratory must wash their hands in a disinfectant solution diluted to the recommended concentration or with a disinfectant soap upon contamination and before leaving the laboratory.<br>
 9. Swab down all working surfaces when the practical session is completed, using disinfectant diluted to the recommended concentration.<br>
 Provide this in a bucket, with a "Wettex" cloth kept for this purpose.<br>
 10. Flood spills with disinfectant and leave to stand for one minute.<br>
 Mop up with "Wettex" from the bench swab bucket.<br>
 Wash hands with disinfectant soap or solution.<br>
 11. Replace all disinfectant solutions at the end of each day.<br>
 12. When exposing microbial cultures to the atmosphere, always work within the safety zone of a Bunsen burner flame.<br>
 This zone extends 15 cm around the flame.<br>
 Any cells that may escape from the cultures, suspensions or bacteriological loop in the form of an aerosol will be drawn into the flame by the convection currents surrounding the flame and be destroyed.<br>
 13. Incubate cultures at room temperature, or a temperature close to the original environment of the organism.<br>
 If you wish to hurry the culture along, try 30<sup>o</sup>C to 34<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 Use disinfectant diluted to the recommended concentration.<br>
 Provide this in a bucket, with a Wettex cloth kept for this purpose.<br>
 To avoid culturing pathogens, do not use of 37<sup>o</sup>C as an incubation temperature, because 37<sup>o</sup>C is the normal human temperature.<br>
 14. Seal Petri dishes after inoculation by taping the circumference with clear adhesive tape.<br>
 The lids must not be removed when the students examine the cultures.<br>
 15. Discard wastes as follows:<br>
 15.1 Discard waste paper in a bin or garbage can for burning.<br>
 15.2 Discard slides into a jar of disinfectant.<br>
 15.3 Discard pipette and fillers and swab sticks into a cylinder of disinfectant.<br>
 15.4 Discard plastic equipment by autoclave, or sterilize in a pressure cooker follow the manufacturer's instructions.<br>
<a href="https://www.teaching.com.au/search?action=search&q=Autoclave">Autoclaves</a> (Modern Teaching Aids)<br>
 The equipment will be destroyed by the treatment and may be incinerated after being sterilized.<br>
 Sterilize plastic equipment separately from glassware.<br>
 15.5 Discard glass equipment.<br>
 Use the autoclave or sterilize in a pressure cooker before cleaning out the material, then wash normally and store until next time.<br>
<a href="https://www.teaching.com.au/search?action=search&q=Autoclave">Autoclaves</a> (Modern Teaching Aids)<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.1.13H">4.1.13</a> Spillage, Safety in school science<br>
Spillage when using fermenters<br>
Large volumes of potentially hazardous substances, e.g. antibiotics, enzymes, pesticides, or growth substances, can be produced, posing problems for dealing with spillages or safe disposal.<br>
 Spillages should be avoided, and if they happen, need to be carefully managed.<br>
 Materials and equipment must be safely sterilized and disposed of after use.<br>
 Any spillages must be cleared up immediately using a suitable disinfectant, e.g. clear phenolic, Clearsol, Hycolin, Putitol, Steticol, Sudol.<br>
 All disinfectants should be freshly prepared, and used at manufacturers' recommended dilutions.<br>
 Spills on clothing may be best disinfected using a surface active disinfectant, e.g. Harris "BAS clean" and "Griffin ASAB".<br>
 Any spillage may cause the formation of an aerosol that may remain for some time.<br>
 If a gross spillage occurs, the laboratory should be cleared immediately and that all accidental microbiological spillage incidents should be recorded.<br>
 Aerosols are fine sprays or suspensions that, in this context, contain microorganisms .<br>
 The scale of liquid culture involved may increase the chance of any contaminant being cultured in large numbers and then being released back into the environment by the formation and escape of aerosols.<br>
 A fermenter must be adequately vented to prevent the build up of pressure in the vessel.<br>
 For work with yeast and similar organisms, a wine making trap or strong non-absorbent cotton wool plug attached to the air vent should be sufficient to trap any fine spray.<br>
 The use of in-line microbiological filter cartridges should be considered.<br>
 In solid culture fermentation, e.g. cheese, tempeh, there is the possibility of fungal spores being produced in quantities sufficient to produce sensitization and possible allergic reactions.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.1.14H">4.1.14</a> "Biotechnology in School"<br>
by Eckhard R. Lucius, IPN, Kiel, Germany, UNESCO / IUBS (edited)<br>
 In the Federal Republic of Germany, the safety of scientific teaching is governed by guidelines set out by the Ministers of Education.<br>
 The code of conduct that generally applies to scientific experiments is expounded here, e.g. no eating, drinking, or smoking in laboratories, chemicals should not be tasted, hands should be washed, pipetting should not be done using the mouth.<br>
Ten Rules for Safe Microbiology<br>
<a href="https://www.teaching.com.au/search?action=search&q=Autoclave">Autoclaves</a> (Modern Teaching Aids)<br>
 The IPN, Institute for Science Education, recommends that the following ten rules should also be observed for microbiological and biotechnical experiments:<br>
 1. Pure cultures of microorganisms suitable for use in schools should be ordered from the DSM (international: from the ATCC: American Type Culture Collection).<br>
 2. Enrichment plates of microorganisms from the environment should be sealed by sticking the slit between the base and lid of the Petri dish together with clear adhesive tape.<br>
 3. Bacteriological experiments with faecal material ("biogas from sewage sludge") should not be done in schools.<br>
 4. Work in sterile conditions, i.e. nutrient solutions should not only be boiled, but sterilized in a pressure cooker or autoclave.<br>
 Glass equipment or pipette and fillers that come into contact with sterile solutions should be sterilized for 30 minutes in a drying cupboard at 18<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 5. Colonies of mould that have formed spores should not be examined under the microscope without using Petri slides.<br>
 6. Do not use antibiotics from a pharmacy for school science experiments to avoid increasing resistance to antibiotics on prescription.<br>
 7. Use disposable Petri dishes instead of glass Petri dishes.<br>
 8. Mouth pipetting should never be employed.<br>
 A piston device should be used to draw the liquid up the pipette and filler instead of a rubber bulb.<br>
 9. Do not leave bacterial cultures that are no longer required lying around.<br>
 Old cultures should be destroyed in a pressure cooker and disposed of.<br>
 10. Only use microbial nucleic acids if they occur naturally in the organism (in vivo DNA).<br>
 Do not use genetically engineered material (in vitro DNA).<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.3.1H">4.3.1</a> Breakdown of pectin by microorganisms<br>
 Pectin, a structural polysaccharide, contains many different constituent sugars.<br>
 It has no definite chemical formula.<br>
 1. To study breakdown of pectin, prepare a growing culture of Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium (Erwinia carotovara) grown in nutrient broth incubated at 20-25<sup>o</sup>C for 48 hours.<br>
 To use the culture, remove the top from the bottle, pass the neck through a Bunsen burner flame three times, take up culture with a sterile dropping pipette and filler, flame the neck again and replace 
 the top on the culture bottle.<br>
 Use the pipette and filler to transfer drops of culture.<br>
 Prepare two Petri dishes as follows:<br> 
 1.1 Use slice of potato or carrot + three drops of deionized water in the centre of one slice (control).<br>
 1.2 Use slice of potato or carrot + three drops of (Erwinia carotovara) culture.<br>
 2. Attach the lids and bases of the Petri dishes with four short strips of clear adhesive tape to protect against accidental opening.<br>
 Incubate the Petri dishes at 20-25<sup>o</sup>C with the lids uppermost overnight.<br>
 3. Examine the potato or carrot slices.<br>
 Note the "soft rot" in the potato slice.<br>
 Be careful! Do not open the Petri dishes.<br>
 Sterilize contaminated materials and equipment by incineration or with autoclave or pressure cooker.<br>
 Use disinfectants, e.g. domestic bleach, for pipettes, syringes, swabbing benches and accidental spills.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.3.2H">4.3.2</a> Breakdown of protein by microorganisms<br>
<a href="../images/9.4.10.gif">See diagram 9.4.10</a>: Agar plates 1.<br>
 1. For breakdown of proteins, two days before the experiment, inoculate two nutrient broths: (Bacillus subtilis) in nutrient broth culture, and (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) in malt extract broth culture.<br>
 Prepare two milk agar plates.<br>
 Prepare and label two plastic Petri dishes containing nutrient agar plates or malt extract agar plates as follows:<br>
 2. Open a culture of (Bacillus subtilis).<br>
 Flame the neck of the container and use a dropping pipette and filler to remove a small amount of culture.<br>
 Reflame the neck of the container and replace the stopper.<br>
 Lift the lid of the first milk agar plate.<br>
 Release one drop of (Bacillus subtilis) culture on to the middle of the agar plate, then replace the lid.<br>
 3. Repeat the procedure with the second milk agar plate and (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) culture.<br>
 4. Attach the lids and bases of the Petri dishes with four short strips of clear adhesive tape to protect against accidental opening.<br>
 Keep the Petri dishes upright until the drops have dried, then invert them and incubate at 20-25<sup>o</sup>C overnight.<br>
 5. The next day, examine the milk agar plates.<br>
 The milk agar is opaque, because of the milk protein casein so clear areas on the milk agar plates indicates activity of protease enzymes.<br>
 Be careful! Do not open the Petri dishes.<br>
 Sterilize contaminated materials and equipment by incineration or with autoclave or pressure cooker.<br>
 Use disinfectants, e.g. domestic bleach, for pipettes, syringes, swabbing benches and accidental spills.<br>

 3. Prepare and label two beakers as follows:<br>
 Beaker 3.1 contains UHT milk + 5 mL heated yoghurt + 1 mL resazurin solution.<br>
 Beaker 3.2 contains UHT milk + 5 mL unheated yoghurt + 1 mL resazurin solution.<br>
 Cover each beaker with cling film ("Glad Wrap"), incubate them at 43<sup>o</sup>C for one day, then store them in a refrigerator.<br>
 4. Record the appearance and smell of the contents of the beakers.<br>
 Test the pH of the contents with Universal indicator solution.<br>
 Be careful!<br>
 Do not open the Petri dishes.<br>
 Sterilize contaminated materials and equipment by incineration or with autoclave or pressure cooker.<br>
 Use disinfectants, e.g. domestic bleach, for pipettes, syringes, swabbing benches and accidental spills.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.4.9H">4.4.9</a> Prepare yoghurt<br>
 (activity for primary grade 4 students, about 9 years old)<br>
Yoghurt is made from milk inoculated with a mixed culture of (Lactobacillus bulgaricus) and (Streptococcus thermophilus), then inoculated for hours then left to cool so that the milk proteins coagulate at about pH 4.3.<br>
 Equipment: 1 one whisk or one wooden spoon, 20 cups or glasses, 1 oven ring, 1 saucepan, 20 teaspoons, 1 thermometer (100<sup>o</sup>C), incubator or insulated box made out of polystyrene foam (dimensions: 20 cm high X 35 cm long X 30 cm wide, thickness of the polystyrene: 6 cm) or "yoghurt machine".<br>
 Materials: 3 litres of milk, 3 containers of yoghurt made from whole milk, cling film.<br>
 1. Heat the milk to 72<sup>o</sup>C to kill any harmful bacteria in the milk.<br>
 2. Allow the milk to cool to 45<sup>o</sup>C or body temperature, 37<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 3. Place a teaspoon (5 mL), of unpasteurized yoghurt and lactic acid bacteria starter into a plastic container.<br>
 4. Add the cooled milk to the container.<br>
 5. Mix all of the ingredients.<br>
 6. Cover the container with cling film.<br>
 7. Place the yoghurt mixture into an insulated box to let the contents incubate at 45<sup>o</sup>C for 3-4 hours or overnight at room temperature.<br>
 8. After the milk has thickened, the yoghurt is ready.<br>
 It tastes acidic.<br>
 9. If yoghurt is made from whole milk, the product is smoother but, unless homogenized, a fat layer may separate.<br>
 To avoid this separation, add 3% of skim milk powder to the fresh milk before adding the yoghurt starter.<br>

| <a href="../images/9.72.gif">See diagram 9.72</a>: Root nodules<br>
 1. To study root nodules, prepare a mannitol yeast extract agar plate (MYEA).<br>
 Dig up leguminous plants and select a piece of root with root nodules.<br>
 Squeeze some nodules to check that the contents are living.<br>
 2. Use tap water to wash soil from the piece of root with root nodules.<br>
 Use forceps to transfer the piece of root into 1% bleach solution to clean the nodules.<br>
 Pass forceps through a Bunsen burner flame, allow to cool and use it to transfer the piece of root to sterile water to rinse off the bleach.<br>
 Repeat this procedure twice more with fresh sterile water.<br>
 Transfer a few drops of sterile water to a sterile Petri dish and add the piece of root using the flamed metal forceps.<br>
 Use a sterile glass rod to macerate the nodules to produce a milky fluid.<br>
 3. Sterilize a wire loop by flaming, cool it, then use it to form streaks of the nodule macerate on the MYEA agar in the Petri dish.<br>
 Attach the lid and base of the Petri dish with four short strips of clear adhesive tape to protect against accidental opening.<br>
 Invert the plate and incubate at 20-25<sup>o</sup>C for three days.<br>
 4. Examine the MYEA plate and note the appearance of any colonies growing on the agar.<br>
 Be careful! Do not open the Petri dish.<br>
 Sterilize contaminated materials and equipment by incineration or with autoclave or pressure cooker.<br>
 Use disinfectants, e.g. domestic bleach, for pipettes, syringes, swabbing benches and accidental spills.<br>

<a href="../images/9.4.10.gif">See diagram 9.4.10</a>: Agar plates 1.<br>
Sensitivity to antiseptics<br>
 1. Prepare a nutrient agar lawn plate ((Bacillus subtilis) or (Micrococcus luteus )or (Escherichia coli)) or malt agar lawn plate ((Saccharomyces cerevisiae)).<br>
 2. Use a marker pen to draw a cross on the bottom of the Petri dish to divide the plate into four sections (a) toothpaste (b) mouthwash, (c) antiseptic (d) sterile water control.<br>
 3. Use forceps sterilized in an oven to dip an absorbent paper disc into the sample (a), drain it on the side of the container and place it firmly on section (a) of the plate.<br>
 Then wash the forceps free of the sample.<br>
 4. Repeat the procedure for samples (b) and (c) and the control (d).<br>
 Use sterile forceps for each sample.<br>
 Open the plate for the minimum possible time.<br>
 5. Seal the Petri dish with four short sections of clear adhesive tape.<br>
 6. Invert the plate and incubate at room temperature or 20-30<sup>o</sup>C for 48 hours.<br>
 7. Examine the plate without opening it and record the size of any zones of inhibition around the paper discs.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.3.20H">4.3.20</a> Tensides, alkylphenol ethoxylates<br>
 Tensides are surface active substances, which reduce the surface tension of water to promote the solubility of sybstances.<br> 
 Tensides are used in washing and cleaning agents, paints, varnishes, metal processing fluids, construction products and paper manufacturings.<br>
 Synthetic alkylphenol ethoxylates, commonly used as non ionic tensides, are a group of non-ionic surface active substances.<br>
 During degradation in wastewater treatment plants and in the environment, nonylphenols are formed, which are only slowly degradable, bioaccumulative and very toxic for aquatic organisms.<br>
 Besides that, hormone-like effects have been observed in fish.<br>
 Nonylphenol ethoxylates have been widely substituted in household and industrial cleaners as well as in flocculates.<br>
