<hr width="100%" size="2">Eucalypt description</a><br>
<a name="1.0H">1.0, Eucalypt fruit, (Greek <i>eu</i> 'good' and <i>kalyptus</i> 'cover', cap-like operculum covers the flower buds.<br>
Eucalypt fruit is a seed-bearing capsule in a woody expanded receptacle, opening at the top when seed shed after dehiscence.<br>
Operculum is the cap of a flower bud, formed by fusion of sepals and petals and which dehisces at maturity, exposing reproductive organs.<br>
<a name="2.0H">2.0, Eucalypt mallee is a woody plant, multi stemmed from ground level, with a woody lignotuber at the base, which has dormant buds for recovery after fire regeneration following crown destruction, and a shrub, is a mature plant, up to 1m, irregularly branched, and without a principal erect stem.<br>
<a name="3.0H">3.0, Eucalypt bark is tissues outermost to the cambium in a woody plant, smooth barks lose all their bark each year, but rough barks do not shed their bark each year.<br>
Stringybark is persistent dead bark with long fibres, scribbles are caused by burrowing insect laevae and rugose bark is wrinked bark.<br>
<a name="4.0H">4.0, Leaves
Green-leaved ash are plants with juvenile leaves and coppice is young stems shooting from a stump or juvenile growth from mature trunks.<br>
Discolorous leaves have different colour upper and lower surfaces.<br>
<a name="5.0H">5.0, Eucalypt kino exudates from the bark of River Red Gum when injured, exudes an abundance of kino and it may be ‘tapped’.<br>
Kino is produced by various trees including the many eucalypts called 'bloodwoods'.<br> 
Kino, once called ‘red gum’, oozes out of the bloodwoods with a very dark red colour and is compared with the resin flow from conifers.<br> 
The red-currant jelly-like kino from the tree, hardens to dark red angular fragments, which are brittle, easily powdered, and have no smell.<br>
It has a very astringent taste, can precipitate proteins, and has chief constituent | Kinotannic acid, C18H18O8 |.<br>
It was an Australian native folk medicine and a once popular treatment for diarrhoea, skin lesions, scabies, sore throats, and powders to arrest haemorrhage.<br>
Also, some of the more than 30 eucalypt kinos were used by first settlers in Australia for ink and for staining leather black.<br>
Commercial timber is damaged by the ‘Gum veins’, when the kino gun ducts are formed when the cambial layer of eucalypts is injured, by fire or insects.<br>
The present East Indian kino, Malabar kino and Amboyna kino are the evaporated juice from (Pterocarpus marsupium), (Butea frondosa), (Eucalyptus siderophloia) and (Eucalyptus camaldulensis).<br>
