<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.1.1H">9.1.1</a> Benzoic acid in lemonade<br>
Benzoic acid, C6H5COOH, white crystalline solid, slightly soluble in water, food preservative, fungistatic compound<br>
Pour half a drink-can of lemonade is poured into a 1 L conical flask and add 2 drops of dilute hydrochloric acid.<br>
Add 50 mL dichloromethane, CH2Cl2, then swirl gently for 5 minutes.<br>
Pour into a separating funnel and leave to allowed to settle for 5 minutes.<br>
Drain the solvent layer into a 100 mL beaker, leave to evaporate in a fume cupboard, and a residue of benzoic acid remains.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.1.2H">9.1.2 Burn carbohydrates, fats and proteins<br>
1. Heated proteins produce ammonia like compounds with different odours.<br>
Burning carbohydrates have a smell of caramel.<br>
Burning fats produce acrolein that prepares the eyes water.<br>
2. Heat separately, until beginning to burn, small samples of: 1. carbohydrate, e.g. starch or sugar 2. fat, e.g. butter 3. protein.<br>
Note the difference in smells produced.<br>
Continue heating all samples until a residue of carbon remains.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.1.3H">9.1.3</a> Caffeine extraction<br>
 Materials can exist in three states: solid, liquid and gas.<br>
 You can change from one to another by altering temperature and / or pressure.<br>
 If you increase temperature and pressure enough, the distinction between liquid and gas will disappear at the critical point.<br>
 No phase boundary between liquid and gas exists, because at extremely high temperatures and pressures, the liquid and gaseous phases become indistinguishable.<br>
 The critical point of water is 374 o C, 218 atmospheres of pressure.<br>
 At above 31.1 oC and 72.9 atmospheres of pressure carbon dioxide behaves like liquid and like a gas.<br>
 It spreads out like a gas to fill the available space and can dissolve substances as if it was a liquid.<br>
 The low temperature is convenient, because it can be used with substances that would be damaged by the high temperature.<br>
 Supercritical carbon dioxide is used to remove caffeine from tea and coffee, an extract substances from hops, essential oils, and environmental pollutants.<br>
 It is also used for dry cleaning.<br>
Supercritical carbon dioxide is used to extract caffeine from coffee beans, extract nicotine from tobacco, extract oil from oilseeds, e.g. soy bean and sunflower, 
extract the natural insecticide pyrethrins from the perennial plant pyrethrum, (Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium).

Caffeine, C8H10N4O2, odourless white powder or white shiny needles, bitter taste, almost neutral to litmus, odourless. 
Caffeine, a purine alkaloid, is a central nervous system stimulant, and is used to mprove quality of life of premature infants.<br>
Caffeine is in analgesic preparations containing Ergotamine for the relief of migraine headaches.<br>
 Caffeine is found in coffee, (Coffea arabica), tea (Camellia sinensis), yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis), guarana (Paullinia cupana) 
 Cola, (Cola nitida).<br>
 Theobromine is found in chocolate, (Theobroba cacao).<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.1.5H">9.1.4</a> Carbonyls<br>
Carboxyl group: COOH<br>
Carbonyl ( >C=O), organic compound functional group<br>
Carbonyls, &gt;C=O, are either aldehydes (RCHO, suffix: -al), or ketones (RR'C=O, suffix: -one)<br>
Carbonyl groups are strongly polar, so the boiling temperatures are higher than similar sizes of alkanes.<br>
But they are not as high as similar sizes of alcohols, because of the hydrogen bonding between alcohol molecules.<br>
As the length of the carbon chains increase in carbonyls, the solubility in water decreases.<br>
Shorter chain carbonyl compounds mix with water, because of the hydrogen bonding between the oxygen of the carbonyl compound and water.<br>
Hydrogen bonds can form between propanone and water molecules.<br>
Carbonyl compounds are unsaturated (C=O), so addition reactions may occur.<br>
For example, the reaction between an aldehyde and hydrogen cyanide in the presence of potassium cyanide (not permitted in schools).<br>
RCHO + HCN --> CN-RCH(OH)<br>
The -CN group is called nitrile in organic chemistry. but is also called cyanide in organic chemistry.<br>
Aldehydes, but not ketones, can be oxidized easily to carboxylic acid with acidified potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7 / H+) as oxidizing agent.<br>
RCHO + [O] --> RC(OH)O<br>
Reducing agents can reduce an aldehyde to a primary alcohol and a ketone to a secondary alcohol.<br>
Experiment<br>
Test for carbonyls by mixing with an acid solution of Brady's reagent (2,4-dinitrophenylhydrozone) in methanol to form derivatives.<br>
Then purify the derivatives by recrystallization, then consult tables of the melting points of the different derivatives.<br>
Weak oxidizing agents can oxidize aldehydes, but not ketones.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.1.6H">9.1.6</a> Carboxylic acids<br>
Fatty acids are open chain aliphatic monocarboxylic acids derived from, or in esterified form in an animal or vegetable fat, oil or wax.<br>
Natural fatty acids usually have an unbranched chain of 4 to 28 carbons that may be saturated or unsaturated.<br>
All acyclic aliphatic carboxylic acids may be called fatty acids.<br>
Carboxylic acids (fatty acids), R-(COOH)n, contain the carboxyl group -CO.OH, i.e -COOH, carbonyl group attached to an hydroxyl group.<br>
They are weak acids, e.g ethanoic acid (acetic acid) CH3COOH, so the general formula is RCOOH.<br>
An anion formed from carboxylic acid is called a carboxylate.<br>
The carbonyl group (carboxy) is -COOH.<br>
Oxo acids have a carboxy group and an aldehyde or ketone group in the same molecule, e.g. HC(=O)CH2CH2CH2C(=O)OH, 5-oxopentanoic acid.<br>
Carboxylic acids, one carboxyl group (R-COOH, RC(=O)OH) (-oic acid) fatty acids.<br>
For example, methanoic acid (formic acid) (HCOOH) and ethanoic acid (acetic acid) (CH3COOH, CH3C=OOH).<br>

(vinegar, eisel, is about 5% acetic acid, sour wine), E260 (anti-bacterial medicine, used to clean toilets, stain remover, dissolves grease, mild disinfectant).<br>
Common name: white vinegar (5%)<br>
Vinegar is a weak 4-5 % solution of acetic acid, CH3COOH.<br>
Pure acetic acid is a colourless liquid that solidifies to ice-like crystals in cold weather, so it is called "glacial" acetic acid.<br>
Acetic acid is a weak acid, but, like citric acid and tartaric acid, it forms carbon dioxide with chalk, baking soda, and forms hydrogen with iron filings and zinc.<br>
Acetic acid is used in the manufacture of artificial silk, non-flam celluloid.<br>

Experiment<br>
 A weak acid can dissolve the calcium in a bone or egg shell<br>
 1. The rubber chicken bone experiment.<br>
 Select a chicken bone, e.g. a "drumstick (tibia and fibula) or a "wishbone", furcula, the forked bone.<br>
 Clean any tissue off the bone, wash it with warm salt water and dry it.<br>
 Try to bend the bone between your fingers.<br>
 Cover a chicken bone with vinegar or dilute acid hydrochloric acid.<br>
 Change the solutions each day for 2 - 5 days.<br>
 The vinegar reacts with the calcium in the bone to form soluble calcium acetate.<br>
 Dry the bone with absorbent paper.<br>
 Try to bend the bone between your fingers.<br>
 The bone can be bent and even tied into a knot, because all the calcium has been removed.<br>
 CaCO3 + 2CH3COOH --> Ca(CH3COO)2 + H2O + CO2<br>
 2. The bouncy egg experiment<br>
 Cover a fresh egg with vinegar or dilute acid hydrochloric acid.<br>
 Change the solutions each day for 7 days.<br>
 Pick up the decalcified egg and drop it to show that it will bounce and not break.<br>
3. Decolorize vinegar<br>
Boil vinegar with decolorizing charcoal.<br>
Ordinary charcoal is not very successful.<br>
Neutralize vinegar with ammonia then half fill an evaporating basin with it and add a piece of litmus paper.<br>
Add dilute ammonia to the evaporating basin then stir the solution until the litmus paper turns blue.<br>
Transfer the liquid, now a solution of ammonium acetate, to a test-tube, add drops of hydrogen peroxide then heat the mixture until it boils.<br>
The brown colour of the solution disappears, destroyed by the oxygen from the hydrogen peroxide.<br>
Use the remaining liquid for the next experiment.<br>

Copper (II) oxide releases oxygen to the food.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.1.10H">9.1.10</a> Trypsin protease<br>
Trypsin is a serine protease that can cleave peptide chains, mainly at the carboxyl side of the amino acids lysine or arginine.<br> 
Experiment 1. The black cross experiment.<br>
Enzyme: 0.5% solution of trypsin | Substrate: powdered fat free lite milk skim milk suspension | (Change substrate concentration by diluting the suspension.)<br>
The action of trypsin on the milk suspension results in a transparent solution.<br>
1. Use a plastic pipette to add 10 drops of milk from a 20℃ water bath to a test tube.<br>
2. Place the bottom of the test tube on the black cross printed on a white laminated card.<br>
3. Using a clean plastic pipette, to add 2 drops of trypsin from a container in the 20℃ water bath to the test tube and start a stop watch.<br>
4. Look directly down the test tube and note the time taken for the solution to become clear, i.e. when the black cross appears through the test tube.<br>
5. Repeat the experiment using water baths set at 30℃, 40℃, 50℃, 60℃ steps and enter the results in a table of results.<br>
Note at which temperature was the reaction the fastest / slowest.<br>
6. Draw a graph of temperature against time.<br>
Note: For most experiments, students are advise to not look directly down a test-tube, but look from the side!<br>
<a href="../images/1.14.gif">See diagram 1.14</a>: Smelling a gas<br>
Experiment 2. The colour change experiment.<br>
1. Prepare trypsin solution and gelatin or casein protein substrate, at equal concentrations.<br>
2. Label test tubes: 20 oC, 30 oC, 40 oC 50 oC, 60 oC X Trial 1, Trial 2, Trial3.<br>
3. Place test tubes containing substrate in water baths and leave to stand.<br> 
4. Add trypsin solution to each substrate and start timing immediately.<br>
5. At 1-minute intervals, assess level of protein breakdown, by using a colour chart or colorimeter.<br>
6. Record the time of chemical reaction completion, i.e. no further colour change.<br> 
Results: As temperature increases from 20 oC to 40 oC, activity of trypsin increases.<br>
The highest reaction rate is at 40 oC.<br>
As temperature increases from 40 oC to 60 oC, the activity of the trypsin decreases - perhaps caused by enzyme denaturation.<br>

Ethanedioic acid-2-water, C2H2O4, oxalic acid, colourless crystals (HOOC-COOH.2H2O).<br>
It occurs in many plants, e.g. rhubarb that can be used as a laxative.<br>
Experiment<br>
Be careful! This experiment must be done in a fume cupboard.<br>
The reaction will be violent, so use very small quantities of chemical.<br>
Add concentrated nitric acid to sucrose in a beaker.<br>
The sucrose starts dissolving.<br>
Heat the mixture in a fume cupboard.<br>
All the sucrose gradually dissolves.<br>
Meanwhile, the nitric acid decomposes to turn the solution yellow, and produces much white smoke.<br>
With the temperature rise, solution colour becomes deeper and a large amount of reddish brown gas is released.<br>
By controlling heating, evaporate the solution nearly to dryness, and volatilize the reddish brown gas as thoroughly as possible.<br>
Cool the beaker in water and snowflake like crystals of ethanedioic acid-2-water (oxalic acid) appear.<br>
Do not use an excessive quantity of nitric acid.<br>
Otherwise, the time for heating would be overlong and the nitric acid would not decompose completely, leading to a yellow product.<br>
sucrose + concentrated nitric acid --> dehydrated ethanedioic acid-2-water, (oxalic acid).<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.3.1H">9.3.1</a> Tests for acetic acid in vinegar<br>

Human albumin is a small globular protein, consisting of a single chain of 585 amino acids.<br> 
Gelatin is hydrocolloid with a small gap between its melting and gelling temperatures.<br>
 1. Heat albumin and gelatine in separate test-tubes.<br>
 They decompose when heated, producing carbon and a mixture of gases one of which usually, but not always, is ammonia.<br>
 2. Add small quantities of albumin and gelatine to water and shake the mixture.<br>
 Warm the mixture and leave to cool.<br>
 They are sparingly soluble in cold water. but are more soluble in hot water.<br>
 When the hot solution is cooled, it may set like a jelly.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.3.3H">9.3.3</a> Tests for aldehydes<br>
 The test for aldehydes uses Tollens' reagent, a solution of silver nitrate in ammonia solution.<br>
 Its is used for silver mirror tests.<br>
 Aldehydes with Tollens' reagent forms a metallic silver mirror as the aldehyde is oxidized and the silver is reduced<br>
 RCHO + [O] --> RCOOH<br>
 Ag+ + e- --> Ag.<br>
1. Be careful because silver salts are expensive! 
 Do not keep the Tollens' reagent after the test, because it can explode on standing.<br>
 Prepare the Tollens' reagent, just before doing the test.<br>
 After doing the test wash the unused Tollens' reagent down the sink with lots of water.<br>
 Do this test in a fume cupboard.<br>
 Prepare Tollens' reagent<br>

 After 2 hours, use tweezers to detach a leaf from the upper end of the shoot and place it in a drop of chloral hydrate solution on a microscope slide.<br>
 Immediately add one drop of iodine potassium iodide solution.<br>
 Mount a coverslip and eExamine the slide under high power.<br>
 The assimilation starch can be seen in the chloroplasts of the waterweed in the form of small blue black dots.<br>
 It has been stained that colour by the iodine potassium iodide solution that is used as a stain for identifying starch.<br>
4. Iodine tests for starch on thin leaves.<br>
 Gather the leaves immediately after they have been exposed to several hours of daylight.<br>
 Put the leaves in boiling water to kill the cells.<br>
 Heat a beaker of water to boiling.<br>
 Turn off the Bunsen burner or electric heater then put a test-tube of methylated spirit in the hot water to boil the alcohol.<br>
 The boiling point of alcohol is lower than the boiling point of water, so if the water is hot enough the alcohol will boil.<br>
 Put the leaves in the hot methylated spirit until the chlorophyll pigment that can mask the reaction is removed to the alcohol.<br>
 When the leaf is almost white, put it in the iodine solution.<br>
 Note the deep blue colour.<br>
 Be careful! Use safety glasses and insulated heat-proof gloves.<br>
5. Iodine tests for starch on several types of leaves and plant storage organs<br>
 Use potato tubers, sweet potato, carrot, onion, apple, banana.<br>
 The test works better with cooked starch, because heat breaks the walls of the starch grains in the plant cells.<br>
 Test leaves at different times of the day after different exposure to sunlight.<br>
 Test variegated leaves and different coloured leaves.<br>
 Test different parts of plants by adding the iodine solution to a cut surface.<br>
6. Add drops of iodine solution to some solid glucose, sucrose, cotton wool, laundry starch, bread, potato and rice.<br>
 The test is positive for the last 4 substances only.<br>
 The blue colour produced when iodine is added to starch is characteristic of starch.<br>
 Margarine may contain a small quantity of starch to differentiate it from butter.<br>
 If liver sausage contains starch, it is adulterated.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.3.5H">9.3.5</a> Tests for plant ash content<br>
The term "ash content" on food packets refers to the percentage weight of the residues on heating, but no "ash" is added to the food.<br>
Experiments<br>
1. After tests for moisture, heat dry remainder to 575 oC to decompose remaining organic compounds, leaving ash residue.<br>
It consists of oxides and salts containing anions, e.g. chlorides and other halides, phosphates, sulfates.<br>
It also contains cations, e.g. calcium, iron, magnesium, and manganese, potassium, sodium.<br>
2. Measure the ash content of plant dry matter.<br>
Weigh a 2 g powdered sample of plant dry matter into a crucible.<br>
Heat over a Bunsen burner in a fume cupboard, gently at first, and then strongly.<br>
Continue heating until only the ash remains as an almost white residue of salts.<br>
After cooling, weigh the crucible again and calculate the percentage ash content in the dry matter.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.3.6H">9.3.6</a> Tests for carbohydrates<br>
 Molisch's test (α-naphtha test), Solubility in water<br>
 Molisch's test: α-naphthol in ethanol + unknown solution + concentrated acid --> violet ring<br>
 Naphthol may contain carcinogenic impurities.<br>
 It should be used only by senior students and not where food is being prepared.<br>
Experiments<br>
1. Molisch's test (α-naphthol test) (Hans Molisch. 1856-1937, Austria).<br>
 Add 0.1 mL 5% ethanolic α-naphthol to 5 ml of medium and swirl the test-tube to mix the solutions.<br>
 Carefully pour concentrated sulfuric acid down the side of the test-tube.<br>
 A violet ring or purple colour at the junction of the liquids indicates carbohydrates.<br>
2. Solubility in water<br>
* Dissolve carbohydrates in water.<br>
 Heat the water if necessary.<br>
 Glucose and sucrose (cane sugar) are soluble in water.<br>
 Cellulose is not soluble in water.<br>
 Starch is insoluble in cold water, but in hot water it forms a solution that may set like a jelly when cooled.<br>
* Tie a teaspoonful of plain wheat flour in a fine cloth, e.g. a handkerchief, and pummel it up and down in a dish of water.<br>
 Allow the white suspension in the dish to settle then decant the water.<br>
 Do the iodine tests for starch on the precipitate.<br>
 Examine the sticky mass left inside the cloth.<br>
 It is mainly gluten and cellulose.<br>
3. Boil the same fruits or vegetables or fruits in water for ten minutes.<br>
 Test the boiled fruits or vegetables with DCPIP solution, the test for vitamin C, ascorbic acid.<br>
 Also, test the cooking water they were boiled in.<br>
4. Crush the boiled fruit or vegetable, add 20
mL of water, then test with DCPIP solution.<br>
 Note which fruit or vegetable extract contains the most ascorbic acid.<br>
5. Test lemon or orange drinks, lemon cordial, blackcurrant juice, pickles, cucumber, and sauerkraut for vitamin C.<br>
6. Test whether ascorbic acid is destroyed in an acidic or a basic solution.<br>
 Cooks may add bicarbonate of soda (sodium hydrogen carbonate), to the water when boiling vegetables to make them look more green.<br>
 However, this chemical destroys vitamin C.<br>
 Vegetables should be cooked quickly in as little water as possible to retain nutrients.<br>
 Vitamin, C is a water-soluble vitamin essential for the formation of collagen in connective tissue.<br>
 Sailors deprived of vitamin, C during long voyages developed scurvy, bleeding gums, lack of wound healing, anaemia, leading to death.<br>

Experiments<br>
 1. Solution of zinc oxide in concentrated hydrochloric acid<br>
 2. Ammoniacal copper carbonate dissolved in dilute ammonia solution<br>
 3. Schweizer's reagent, (not "Schweitzer"): Dissolve 0.3% solution of precipitated copper (II) hydroxide solution in a 20%, dilute ammonia solution.<br> 
 It forms tetraammine copper dihydroxide, cuprammonium hydroxide [Cu(NH3)4](OH)2) complex ion, Cu(NH3)42+.<br>
 The reagent forms a deep azure solution.<br>
 Mathias Eduard Schweizer, 1818-1860, Switzerland, discovered this method of dissolving cellulose in copper tetra-ammine.<br>
 Cellulose does not change the colour of Fehling's solution.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.3.8H">9.3.8</a> Tests for diastase activity<br>
Diastase is a group of enzymes, α-amylase or β-amylase, or γ-amylase, that hydrolyses the breakdown of starch to maltose.<br>
Diastase was originally extracted from the barley mash used to brew beer.<br>
Diastase occurs in seeds and in the pancreas.<br>
Taka-diastase from, (Aspergillus oryzae) powder is sold to laboratories for research.<br>
Experiments<br>
1. Prepare active diastase<br>
Buy taka-diastase from the chemist and prepare a 0.1% solution, or,<br>
Germinate barley grains on damp filter paper until the shoots begin to emerge.<br>
Crush the shoots with a mortar and pestle, add 50 mL of water then filter.<br>
The filtrate will contain active diastase.<br>
2. Boil half the active diastase solution.<br>
Prepare a 1% solution of starch and place 5 mL in one each of two test-tubes.<br>
Add an equal quantity of the unboiled or boiled diastase extract to the two test-tubes.<br>
Periodically take a drop of the mixture from each tube and test its reaction with dilute iodine on a white tile.<br>
At first, the blue-black starch colour occurs in both test-tubes.<br>
However, this colour in the test-tube containing unboiled enzyme is soon replaced by reddish colours.<br>
Then finally, it is replaced by no colour, showing that starch has been converted to simpler substances, mostly to sugars.<br>
The temporary production of red colours occurs, because of the formation of intermediate substances, e.g. dextrin.<br>
The mixture containing boiled enzyme will continue to give the starch reaction.<br>
Apply the Fehling's test to each test-tube.<br>
The above experiment will proceed faster if the tubes are placed in a water bath at a temperature of 30 oC to 40 oC.<br>
Compare the time required for the reaction to reach completion at room temperature and at the higher temperature.<br>
3. Diastase is an amylase that acts on starch and breaks it into simple sugars.<br>
Working concentrations suggested by the supplier: 5 mL starch (1%), 5 mL diastase (1%).<br>
To monitor the progress of the reaction, place 2 drops iodine solution in each of 6 tile wells.<br>
Immediately after you mix the starch and diastase, transfer 2 drops of the mixture to the first well.<br>
 Repeat this at 30 s intervals in succeeding wells.<br>
To confirm the presence of reducing sugars, e.g. glucose, use Benedict's test.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.3.9H">9.3.9</a> Tests for fats and oils<br>
 Examples of fats: butter, margarine, beef dripping, mutton dripping, suet and tallow.<br>
 Examples of oils: olive oil, castor oil, linseed oil, coconut oil.<br>
 Oils are oily liquids at room temperature that float on water.<br>
Experiments<br>
1. Paper tests for fats<br>
* Mark two pencil crosses on writing paper, 10 cm apart.<br>
 Use a pipette to put a drop of olive oil (fat) on one cross and use another pipette put a drop of water on the other cross.<br>
 Compare both crosses after 12 hours and 24 hours.<br>
 Note how the cross on which the oil was dropped can be distinguished.<br>
 Fat makes a translucent mark on paper.<br>
* Cut different foods and press the cut surface
 on white paper, e.g. walnut, hazelnut, coconut, sausage, butter, boiled egg white, sugar lump.<br>
 Note which foodstuffs make a translucent mark and so contain fat.<br>
* Rub foods with absorbent brown paper to indicate the spread of fat.<br>
2. Sudan III tests for fats<br>
 The fat soluble dye Sudan (III) stains triglycerides, C22H16N4O, 1-[{4-(phenyldiazenyl)phenyl}diazenyl] naphthalen-2-ol.<br>
 It is carcinogenic.<br>
 Make a saturated solution of Sudan III in a 1:1 solution of 70% ethanol and acetone.<br>
 Dilute this solution by preparing a 6:4 solution with ethanol.<br>
* Half fill a test-tube with water, add drops of Sudan III solution, shake the test-tube and note the faintly pink colour.<br>
 Be careful! Use safety goggles and nitrile chemical resistant gloves when handling stains.<br>
 Add the same number of drops of olive oil, shake the solution and leave to stand in a test-tube rack.<br>
 Wait for the oil to settle to the top of the test-tube.<br>
 Note the colour of the oil and the water.<br>
* Add a drop of Sudan III solution to cut seeds
 and nuts, e.g. castor bean seed, sunflower seed.<br>
 Cut a very thin slice of the seed and examine under high power.<br>
* Solvent for Sudan III<br>
Put drops of Sudan III dye in a test-tube.<br>
Add water and shake the test-tube.<br>
The dye does not dissolve.<br>
Add a little oil or melted butter and shake the test-tube.<br>
The dye dissolves in fats and in oils.<br>
3. Fat is not soluble in water, but is soluble in ether, chloroform and acetone.<br>
 Students should not be allowed to work with ether or chloroform, because they are very volatile, so students should not do this test.<br>
4. Apply osmic acid to the cut surface of nuts and seeds.<br>
 A black colour forms to show the presence of oil.<br>
 Osmic acid is an acute poison if ingested, inhaled or in contact with the skin.<br>
 So this test should NOT be done in a school laboratory.<br>
5. Heat drops of oil in a Pyrex test-tube.<br>
 Oil decomposes on heating to leave carbon.<br>

The blue bottle experiment<br>
 In a sodium hydroxide solution, the aldehyde glucose is oxidized by oxygen gas, to gluconic acid, then forms sodium gluconate.<br>
 Methylene blue acts as an oxygen transfer catalyst and is reduced to colourless leucomethylene blue.<br>
 Leucomethylene blue is then oxidized by oxygen in the air to methylene blue again.<br>
 Methylene blue, C16H18ClN3S, a thiazine dyestuff, is blue when oxidized and colourless when reduced.<br>
Experiments<br>
1. Solution 1: Add 2.5 g glucose (dextrose) + 2.5 g sodium hydroxide + 1 mL 0.1% solution methylene blue to 500 mL water.<br>
 Solution 2: Add 5 g glucose + 5 g NaOH + 1 mL 0.1% solution methylene blue to 500 mL water.<br>
 Note that the blue colour of Solution 2 disappears faster than in Solution 1.<br>
 The blue colour appears at the surface of the solutions, because of oxygen in the air.<br>
 Shake the flasks and the blue colour returns.<br>
 Solution 2: Dissolve 0.05 g of methylene blue in 50 mL 0.1% ethanol.<br>
 Solution 2: Dissolve 6 g of NaOH (or 8 g KOH), in 300 mL water in a conical flask at above 25 oC.<br>

 Close the flask and shake to dissolve air in the solution, or pour the solution from a height.<br>
 The colour changes to blue then fades back to colourless.<br>
 Repeat the shaking many times and note the colour changes.<br>
 Leave the solution for some hours and shake again.<br>
 The solution turns yellow and no colour change occurs after shaking.<br>
 Repeat the experiment. but instead of shaking the flask, pass nitrogen gas or natural gas through the solution.<br>
 No colour change occurs, because oxygen was not dissolved as in the shaking.<br>
2. Repeat with other dyes:<br>
 2.1 Phenosafranine solution is red when oxidized and colourless when reduced.<br>
 Use 6 drops of 0.2% solution in water that becomes pink on shaking and colourless when standing, after some time.<br>
 2.2 Phenosafranine, 6 drops of 0.2% solution in water + 20 drops of 0.1% methylene blue in ethanol.<br>

 On standing, the sequence of colours reverses.<br>
 2.3 Indigo carmine solution becomes brown-red on gentle shaking and pale green on more shaking.<br>
 On standing the sequence of colours reverses.<br>
 2.4 Resazurin (red to colourless) is dark blue when first added to the solution, then becomes pale blue, then becomes pink purple on shaking.<br>
 Resazurin has dichromatism (polychromatism), the hue of the colour depends both on the concentration of the absorbing substance and

Lipase is an esterase enzyme that hydrolyses fats (glycerides) to form glycerol and fatty acids.<br>
It occurs in milk and milk products and is often included in detergent solutions.<br>
Ingestion of large amounts is harmful.<br>
Lipases are produced by the bacteria, (Bacillus megabacterium) and (Bacillussubtilis), and the fungus (Rhizopus stolonifera).<br>
Experiments<br>
1. Test for activity of lipase in castor oil seeds<br>
Shell 10 g of castor oil seeds and divide into 2 portions.<br>
Use a mortar and pestle to crush one portion with 4 g of castor oil and 5 mL water.<br>
Treat the second portion in the same way, but use 5 mL N/10 sulfuric acid instead of the 5 mL water.<br>
Allow both portions to stand for about one hour, then to each add 25 mL of alcohol.<br>
Then titrate the free acid in each with a normal solution of caustic soda, using phenolphthalein as an indicator.<br>
Note that the second portion that was pounded with acid, contains a much greater amount of free acid.<br>
This shows that the activity of lipase present in the seeds has been accelerated in an acid medium.<br>
2. Test for activity of lipase in milk<br>
Lipase can break down the fat in milk into fatty acids.<br>
Make the milk alkaline by the adding a weak solution of sodium bicarbonate.<br>

 Albustix strips are test papers dipped into buffered tetrabromophenol blue solution (C19H10Br4O5S), as an indicator solution.<br>
 The indicator on the Albustix strip can combine with proteins.<br>
 This change will in turn change the colour of the strip from yellow to shades of green.<br>
 They are used by doctors to test the proteins present in a sample of human urine both quickly and semi-quantitatively.<br>
 Protein in the urine may suggest kidney disease when the glomerular membrane allows passage of serum albumin and serum globulin from the blood plasma.<br>
 The test is most sensitive to albumin.<br>
 Normally it contains 20 mg / 100 L.<br>
 Dip an Albustix strip in a protein solution and observe the change in its colour.<br>
 One end of an albustix strip is impregnated with an inert base containing tetrabromophenol blue, buffered to pH3 with a citrate buffer.<br>
 Saturation of the strip with protein causes a colour change yellow to green to blue to show concentration of protein in the solution.<br>
2. The burning test<br>
 Burn feathers or hairs and note the gases that form.<br>
 These proteins contain sulfur.<br>
 Try the same test on samples of fats and carbohydrates to observe if the results are different enough to detect proteins.<br>
3. The heat test<br>
 * Proteins decompose when heated to form carbon and a mixture of gases.<br>
 One gas is usually ammonia.<br>
 Proteins are slightly soluble in cold water, but are more soluble in hot water.<br>
 When the hot solution is cooled, it may set like a jelly.<br>
 Heat proteins until they char.<br>
 Smell the gases that form.<br>
 Heat a protein solution and note any changes.<br>
 The change is similar to the change in the egg white when it is boiled.<br>

 Also, shake ground pea seeds with water for several minutes, filter the mixture and keep the filtrate.<br>
 Add drops of Millon's reagent and heat.<br>
 Be careful! Millon's Reagent contains mercury (I) nitrate in nitrous acid.<br>
 This document does not recommend the use of mercury salts in school experiments.<br>
 However, the amount of mercury (I) nitrate in drops of Millon's Reagent is very small.<br>
4.2 Add drops of Millon's reagent to equal number of drops of a protein solution.<br>
 Proteins form a white precipitate that turns pink when heated.<br>
 A brick-red precipitate indicates the presence of the amino acid tyrosine.<br>
4.3 Millon's reagent (Millon's solution)<br>
 In some school systems this test is not allowed, because this reagent contains mercury (I) nitrate.<br>
 Do not prepare Millon's reagent.<br>
 Add drops of Millon's reagent to protein solution then heat the solution.<br>

 A carmine colour indicates the presence of arginine.<br>
The xanthoproteic test<br>
 Do not allow students to handle concentrated nitric acid.<br>
 In some school systems, this test is not recommended for use in schools.<br>
 Yellow xanthoprotein is formed by hot nitric acid with albumin or protein.<br>
 Add ammonia to change to a deep orange-yellow colour to identify proteins.<br>
 Prepare a protein solution by shaking the egg white in its own volume of water.<br>
 Also, shake ground pea seeds with water for several minutes, filter the mixture and keep the filtrate.<br>

 To a protein solution add one third of that volume of concentrated nitric acid.<br>
 Heat gently to boiling with care.<br>
 The precipitate changes from white to yellow.<br>
 Cool the mixture under the tap and add drops of concentrated ammonia solution.<br>
 The reaction produces an orange colour.<br>
 Positive results come from proteins containing an aromatic group, e.g. phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophane.<br>
5.2. Add concentrated nitric acid to the protein solution then heat the solution with care.<br>

 Also, shake ground pea seeds with water for several minutes, filter the mixture and keep the filtrate.<br>
 Do not allow students to handle concentrated nitric acid.<br>
 Add concentrated nitric acid to the protein solution then heat the solution with care.<br>
 Note the yellow colour.<br>
 Cool the mixture under the tap then add drops of concentrated ammonia solution.<br>
 The colour intensifies to orange.<br>
 Repeat the experiment with expressed plant juice, pieces of plant tissue and slices of plant tissue on a microscopic slide.<br>
 Low levels of ammonia may harm some asthmatics and other sensitive individuals.<br>
 Students should not do this test.<br>
6. The biuret test<br>
 A "biuret test" is a general term for any reaction for a test for proteins where sodium hydroxide solution is added then copper sulfate solution.<br>
 So a "biuret test" may not need to use biuret, NH2CONHCONH2, at all!<br>
 Prepare a protein solution by shaking the egg white in its own volume of water.<br>
 Also, shake ground pea seeds with water for several minutes, filter the mixture and keep the filtrate<br>
Experiments<br>
6.1 Add 1 mL of 2 M sodium hydroxide solution and 1 mL of copper sulfate solution to the sample solution.<br>
 If the solution turns purple, protein is present in the sample.<br>
6.2 Add an equal volume of 1% potassium hydroxide solution + a few drops of 1% copper sulfate solution to the sample solution.<br>
 If the solution turns purple, protein is present in the sample.<br>
6.3 Add an equal volume of 40% sodium hydroxide solution to any protein solution, e.g. egg albumin, dried milk, gelatine.<br>
 Add drops of dilute copper (II) sulfate solution with a light blue colour.<br>
 The reaction produces a violet colour.<br>
6.4 Biuret test using biuret<br>
 Biuret, NH2CONHCONH2, is formed from heated urea, and crystallizes as NH2CONHCONH2.H2O.<br>
 An alkaline solution of biuret gives red-violet colour with copper (II) sulfate solution, because of reaction with peptide bonds.<br>
However, but no reaction if the solution contains amino acids.<br>
 The concentration of the colour is proportional to the amount of protein (Beer-Lambert law), so the biuret test is almost quantitative.<br>
 If the sample contains soluble protein, the reagent turns from light blue to purple. but if the reagent remains light blue, the sample does not contain protein.<br>
 The biuret test detects peptide bonds between amino acids.<br>
 6.5 Prepare biuret solution with potassium hydroxide, copper (II) sulfate and potassium sodium tartrate (KNaC4H4O6.4H2O).<br>
 If the blue reagent turns violet it has detected proteins.<br>
 If it turns pink it has detected short chain polypeptides.<br>
6.6 Dissolve 3 g of copper sulfate and 12 g of potassium tartrate in 1 litre of deionized water.<br>
 Slowly add 600 mL of 10% sodium hydroxide with constant stirring.<br>
 A purple colour indicates protein.<br>
6.7 Add to small quantities of albumin and gelatine to biuret solution, potassium hydroxide solution and then a few drops of copper (II) sulfate solution.<br>
 They produce a deep blue violet colour when treated with solution of copper (II) sulfate and an alkali.<br>
6.8 Biuret reaction<br>
 Prepare a protein solution by shaking the white of an egg in its own volume of water.<br>
 Also, shake ground pea seeds with water for several minutes, filter the mixture and keep the filtrate.<br>
 Add drops of 10% sodium hydroxide solution to protein solution then add drops of copper (II) sulfate solution.<br>
 Note the violet colour.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.3.19H">9.3.19</a> Tests for starch hydrolysis<br>
1. The dilute hydrochloric acid test<br>
Do not allow students to handle concentrated hydrochloric acid.<br>
Experiments<br>
1a. Do Fehling's tests for simple sugars on a 1% starch solution.<br>
No reaction occurs if the starch is pure.<br>
Add 10 drops of concentrated hydrochloric acid to 10 mL of 1% starch solution in a test-tube.<br>
Stand the test-tube in boiling water for 10 minutes then leave to cool.<br>
Take 5 mL of this solution and neutralize it by adding 1 mL of sodium hydroxide solution.<br>
Do Fehling's tests for simple sugars.<br>
If the test is not positive, heat the solution for a longer period and test again.<br>
The starch is converted to simple reducing sugars by acid hydrolysis.<br>
Compare the results at room temperature and 10 oC above room temperature.<br>
1b. Test the results with "Testape".<br>
Tear off a small piece of "Testape".<br>
Lay it on the bench and add drops of the solutions.<br>
After 30 seconds, compare the colours of the test paper with the colour chart on the Testape dispenser.<br>
1c. Do the Fehling's test on a colloidal solution of starch.<br>
Note the reaction is negative.<br>
Hydrolyse a portion of the starch solution by boiling with equal volume of dilute sulfuric acid for 10 minutes, and keep stirring.<br>
Test the solution periodically by applying the iodine test on a drop on a tile.<br>
Note the stages of colour changes.<br>
Neutralize the solution and apply the Fehling's test.<br>
1d. Do Fehling's tests for simple sugars on a 1% cent sucrose solution.<br>
 No reaction occurs with sucrose solution if it is pure.<br>
 Add 10 drops of 10% hydrochloric acid to the 1% cent sucrose solution.<br>
 Boil the solution for 2 minutes and leave to cool.<br>
 Add 10 drops of sodium hydroxide solution to neutralize the acid.<br>
 Do Fehling's tests for simple sugars.<br>
 Stand the test-tube in boiling water.<br>
 The reaction produces a red precipitate in the sucrose solution.<br>
 The intensity of the colour depends on the extent of the hydrolysis.<br>
2. The salivary amylase test<br>
Tests for hydrolysis of starch, salivary amylase<br>
Plants have α-amylase and β-amylase (diastase in brewing malt).<br>
Animals have only α-amylase, pancreatic amylase, salivary amylase (ptyalin, alpha-amylase).<br>
The amylase enzyme hydrolyses the 1, 4-glycosidic bonds in starch to produce reducing sugars.<br>
You may have to seek approval to work with human saliva.<br>
Instead of using human saliva, use salivary amylase from a laboratory supply company.<br>
Experiments<br>
2a. Prepare a dilute saliva solution by rinsing 20 mL of warm water in the mouth for one minute then spit it into a beaker.<br>
Use a teat pipette to add 2 mL of dilute saliva to 10 mL of fresh 1% starch solution.<br>
Stir the solution thoroughly.<br>
Record the time of adding the saliva.<br>
At 5 minute intervals, put 2 drops of the saliva starch solution in a test-tube or on a white tile and add a drop of iodine solution.<br>
Note the colour of the solution.<br>
Wash the dropper between each test.<br>
For each successive test, the blue colour decreases, because starch is being converted to glucose sugar.<br>
Saliva contains salivary amylase, (ptyalin), a catalyst that converts starch to the simple sugar maltose and water.<br>
2b. Put 3 drops of the starch and saliva solution into a test-tube.<br>
Add 3 mL of Fehling's solution and heat the solution until almost boiling.<br>
Note the colour of the precipitate.<br>
For each successive drop of starch and saliva solution test at 5 minute intervals.<br>
The brick-red precipitate increases, showing that the amount of glucose sugar is increasing.<br>
The enzyme salivary amylase in the saliva is breaking down starch into glucose sugar.<br>
2c. Remove a drop of the starch and saliva solution and put it on a white tile.<br>
Put a drop of iodine solution on the drop of starch and saliva solution.<br>
Note the colour of the solution.<br>
For each successive drop taken out at each 5 minute interval, the blue colour decreases, showing that starch is being converted to glucose sugar.<br>
Wash the dropper between each test.<br>

 The dropper must be washed between each test.<br>
 Put some iodine solution on each drop.<br>
 The decreasing intensity of the blue colour shows the decreasing amount of starch.<br>
 2. To test for increasing amounts of sugar, put 3 drops of the reaction mixture into a small test-tube.<br>
 Add 3 mL of Fehling's solution and heat this mixture almost to boiling point.<br>
 The test should show that there is more sugar after boiling.<br>
 3. Boil cut potato in water then let cool.<br>
 Filter the solution to separate the soluble amylase from the insoluble amylopectin of the starch grains.<br>
 Add tincture of iodine to the filtered starch solution An intense blue colour occurs.<br>
 The solution contains beta-amylase, C6H10O5 that forms a complex with iodine: (beta-amylase)p (I-) (I2)r(H2O)s [where r &lt; p &lt; s].<br>
 Salivary amylase enzyme breaks down starch into the reducing sugars (+)glucose and maltose.<br>
 Reducing sugars do not react with iodine solution and starch does not react with Fehling's solution.<br>
 The sugars reduce copper (II) in Fehling's solution to brick-red copper (I) oxide.<br>

 Note the intensity of the brick-red colour increasing with time.<br>
 Repeat the experiment every 2 minutes with clean droppers.<br>
 Note the decreasing intensity of the blue colour that shows that starch is being used up.<br>
 Keep doing the test until it shows that there is more sugar after boiling.<br>
Tests for starch breakdown<br>
Salivary amylase enzyme breaks down starch into the reducing sugars maltose and, in smaller amounts, glucose<br>
Reducing sugars do not react with iodine solution and starch does not react with Fehling's solution.<br>
The sugars reduce copper (II) in Fehling's solution to brick-red copper (I) oxide.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.3.20H">9.3.20</a> Tests for starch in potato<br>
 Scrape the cut surface of a potato tuber.<br>
 Put a scraping as big as a pin head in a drop of water on a microscope slide and apply a coverslip.<br>
 Examine the tissue under the low power.<br>
 Put a drop of iodine solution on the microscope slide to touch one side of the coverslip.<br>
 Touch a piece of absorbent paper to the other side of the coverslip to draw the iodine solution across.<br>
 Keep looking down the microscope and see the starch grains turning blue.<br>
 Examine the starch grains in the cells under high power.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.3.21H">9.3.21</a> Tests for starch, iodine test<br>
Iodine is scarcely soluble in water, so iodine solution is iodine dissolved in potassium iodide solution.<br>
To make iodine solution, I2/ KI, dissolve 15 g of potassium iodide in 20 mL of water.<br>
Then dissolve 3 g of iodine crystals in this solution and make up to 1 litre with demineralized water.<br>
Use safety glasses and nitrile chemical-resistant gloves when weighing solid iodine, because it is harmful and corrosive.<br>
Once in solution, the amounts of iodine used are minute.<br>
Different starches contain different proportions of amylose and amylopectin, both polymers of glucose.<br>
Amylose gives the deep blue colour. but amylopectin gives a red-brown colour.<br>
Tincture of iodine antiseptic is a solution of iodine in ethanol.<br>
Store an iodine container inside a second container, because the lid of the iodine container may deteriorate.<br>
 When testing for the enzyme digestion of starch, when starch is present, iodine is dark blue.<br>
 If the blue colour lightens or disappears, this indicates starch is breaking down.<br>
 Factors such as temperature, pH and concentration can affect the rate of breakdown of starch.<br>
 However, how to quantify the degree of breakdown, remains a problem.<br>

The solution contains β-amylase, C6H10O5, forms a complex with iodine: (β-amylase)p (I-), (I2)r(H2O)s [where r &lt; p&lt; s].<br>
3. Do the iodine test for starch on a solution of glucose.<br>
 Pure glucose sugar does not react with iodine solution.<br>
 Iodine is poisonous and should not be used where food is being prepared.<br>
4. Sugar, the products of photosynthesis, and the large starch molecules formed from many sugar molecules are present in leaves.<br>
 For a simple starch test add a dilute iodine solution and note the typical blue-black colour that shows that starch is present.<br>
 Use tubers, potatoes or a starch paste to show the colour change.<br>
5. When testing leaves softening the leaf cells by boiling in water for a few minutes is necessary.<br>
 Then the leaf is put in boiling alcohol until the pigments that will mask the reactions are removed from the leaf.<br>
 Chlorophyll is usually removed in 5-8 minutes, but fleshy leaves may take longer or need a change of alcohol for removal of pigments.<br>
 The iodine solution should react with the starch within 15 minutes.<br>
6. Purchase: Iodine, trace metals basis, I2.<br>
Purchase: Potassium iodide, ACS reagent, 99.0%, KI.<br>
Store iodine container inside a second container, because the lid of the iodine container may deteriorate.<br>
Iodine is scarcely soluble in water, so iodine solution is iodine dissolved in potassium iodide solution.<br>
Use safety glasses and nitrile gloves when weighing solid iodine, because it is harmful and corrosive.<br>
Once in solution the amounts of iodine used are minute.<br>
Specific tests for starch giving blue-black colour and general stain.<br>

Tests for unsaturated fats<br>
 1. Acidified potassium manganate (VII) solution test<br>
 The fat sample, e.g. coconut oil, palm oil, sunflower oil, should first be dissolved in a warm solvent, e.g. ethanol or Volasil (octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane), 
5 drops added to 5 drops.<br>
 Add drops of 0.0005 M potassium manganate (VII) solution acidified with 1 M sulfuric acid.<br>
 Swirl the test-tube when adding the drops and note the number of drops used before the purple solution changes to colourless, then settles to a faint purple colour.<br>
 The number of drops of acidified potassium manganate (VII) solution needed to produce the faint purple colour tint is a crude estimation of the relative number of 
double bonds in the fat, i.e. the degree of unsaturation of the fat.<br>
2. The bromine water test<br>
 The fat sample, e.g. coconut oil, palm oil, sunflower oil, should first be dissolved in a solvent, e.g. ethanol or Volasil (octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane), 5 drops added

 Add drops of bromine water in a fume cupboard or under a fume hood or near an open window.<br>
 Swirl test-tube when adding drops and note number of drops used before yellow-orange bromine water changes to yellow tint.<br>
 The number of drops of bromine water needed to produce the yellow tint is a crude estimation of the relative number of double bonds in the fat, i.e. the degree of
 unsaturation of the fat.<br>
 However, some students cannot recognize this permanent yellow tint.<br>

 Change in colour of the reagent (purple permanganate to brown manganese dioxide) redox reaction.<br>
 Add 0.1 g or 0.2 mL of the paraffin to 2 mL of water or ethanol, + 2% aqueous potassium permanganate solution, drop by drop while shaking until the purple colour
 of the permanganate persists.<br>
 The positive test is the gradual disappearance of the purple colour and the appearance of a brown suspension of MnO2, or the solution turns red-brown.<br>
 The test works for most aldehydes, formic acid, formic acid esters, phenols, mercaptans and thioethers.<br>
4. The bromine water test<br>
 Alkene or alkyne (double bonds or triple bonds) + bromine water, yellow colour disappears.<br>
 However, aromatic compounds do not decolorize bromine water, because they are very stable compounds.<br>
Experiments<br>
 Shake the following gases with bromine water in a test-tube closed with a stopper:<br>
 * Methane, CH4<br>
 No reaction<br>
 * Hexane, C6H14, does not decolorize bromine water<br>
 * Ethene (ethylene)<br>
 The yellow orange colour of the bromine water disappears and colourless 1,2-dibromethane (ethylene dibromide) forms.<br>
 Remove the stopper and notice the characteristic odour of 1, 2-dibromethane (ethylene dibromide).<br>
 H2C=CH2 + Br2 -->Br.CH2.CH2.Br (ethylene dibromide)<br>

Ethyl alcohol is present in the fermenting mixture.<br>
The fermentation of the sugar occurs under the influence of the zymase complex of enzymes.<br>
Repeat the experiment with other sugars, e.g. sucrose.<br>
2. To show that yeast contain an active catalase enzyme, use a double test-tube with the inner tube filled with 2 vols hydrogen peroxide.<br>
Add 1 g yeast and observe the rapid evolution of a gas.<br>
Test the gas with a glowing splint to show it is oxygen.<br>
