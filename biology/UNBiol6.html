<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.1.1H">9.1.1</a> Burn carbohydrates, fats and proteins<br>
1. Heated proteins produce ammonia like compounds with different odours.<br>
Burning carbohydrates have a smell of caramel.<br>
Burning fats produce acrolein that prepares the eyes water.<br>
2. Heat separately, until beginning to burn, small samples of: 1. carbohydrate, e.g. starch or sugar 2. fat, e.g. butter 3. protein.<br>
Note the difference in smells produced.<br>
Continue heating all samples until a residue of carbon remains.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.1.2H">9.1.2</a> Carbonyls<br>
Carboxyl group: COOH<br>
Carbonyl ( >C=O), organic compound functional group<br>
Carbonyls, &gt;C=O, are either aldehydes (RCHO, suffix: -al), or ketones (RR'C=O, suffix: -one)<br>
Carbonyl groups are strongly polar so the boiling temperatures are higher than similar sizes of alkanes.<br>
But they are not as high as similar sizes of alcohols, because of the hydrogen bonding between alcohol molecules.<br>
As the length of the carbon chains increase in carbonyls the solubility in water decreases.<br>
Shorter chain carbonyl compounds mix with water, because of the hydrogen bonding between the oxygen of the carbonyl compound and water.<br>
Hydrogen bonds can form between propanone and water molecules.<br>
Carbonyl compounds are unsaturated (C=O) so addition reactions may occur.<br>
For example, the reaction between an aldehyde and hydrogen cyanide in the presence of potassium cyanide (not permitted in schools).<br>
RCHO + HCN --> CN-RCH(OH)<br>
The -CN group is called nitrile in organic chemistry. but is called cyanide in organic chemistry.<br>
Aldehydes, but not ketones, can be oxidized easily to carboxylic acid with acidified potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7 / H<sup>+</sup>) as oxidizing agent.<br>
RCHO + [O] --> RC(OH)O<br>
Reducing agents can reduce an aldehyde to a primary alcohol and a ketone to a secondary alcohol.<br>
Test for carbonyls by mixing with an acid solution of Brady's reagent (2,4-dinitrophenylhydrozone) in methanol to form derivatives.<br>
Then purify the derivatives by recrystallization, then consult tables of the melting points of the different derivatives.<br>
Weak oxidizing agents can oxidize aldehydes, but not ketones.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.1.3H">9.1.3</a> Carboxylic acids, fatty acids and their salts<br>
Fatty acids are open chain aliphatic monocarboxylic acids derived from, or in esterified form in an animal or vegetable fat, oil or wax.<br>
Natural fatty acids usually have an unbranched chain of 4 to 28 carbons that may be saturated or unsaturated.<br>
All acyclic aliphatic carboxylic acids may be called fatty acids.<br>
Carboxylic acids (fatty acids), R-(COOH)n, contain the carboxyl group -CO.OH, i.e -COOH, carbonyl group attached to an hydroxyl group.<br>
They are weak acids, e.g ethanoic acid (acetic acid) CH3COOH, so the general formula is RCOOH.<br>
An anion formed from carboxylic acid is called a carboxylate.<br>
The carbonyl group (carboxy) is -COOH.<br>
Oxo acids have a carboxy group and an aldehyde or ketone group in the same molecule, e.g. HC(=O)CH2CH2CH2C(=O)OH, 5-oxopentanoic acid.<br>
Carboxylic acids, one carboxyl group (R-COOH, RC(=O)OH) (-oic acid) fatty acids.<br>
For example, methanoic acid (formic acid) (HCOOH) and ethanoic acid (acetic acid) (CH3COOH, CH3C=OOH).<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.1.4H">9.1.4</a> Dicarboxylic acids<br>
Dicarboxylic acids, 2 carboxyl groups (suffix: -dioic acid)<br>
Examples<br>
Ethanedioic acid, (oxalic acid) | (COOH)2 | (CO2H)2 |  H2C2O4 | HO−C(=O)−C(=O)−OH |<br>
Propanedioic acid, (malonic acid) | CH2(COOH)2 | C3H4O4 |<br>
Butanedioic acid: Maleic acid, cis HO2CCH=CHCO2H | Fumaric acid, transHO2CCH=CHCO2H, (So two Butanedioic acids!)<br>
Succinic acid | (CH2)2(CO2H)2, | C4H6O4 |<br>
Butanoic acid (n-butyric acid) | C3H7COOH |  CH3CH2CH2CO2H |<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.1.5H">9.1.5</a> Effect of temperature on the rate of reaction of trypsin<br>
Enzyme: 0.5% solution of trypsin<br>
Substrate: powdered fat free lite milk skim milk suspension<br>
(Change substrate concentration by diluting the suspension.)<br>
The action of trypsin on the milk suspension results in a transparent solution.<br>
1. Use a plastic pipette to add 10 drops of milk from a 20℃ water bath to a test tube.<br>
2. Place the bottom of the test tube on the black cross printed on a white laminated card.<br>
3. Using a clean plastic pipette, to add 2 drops of trypsin from a container in the 20℃ water bath to the test tube and start a stop watch.<br>
4. Look directly down the test tube and note the time taken for the solution to become clear, i.e. when the black cross appears through the test tube.<br>
5. Repeat the experiment using water baths set at 30℃, 40℃, 50℃, 60℃ steps and enter the results in a table of results.<br>
Note at which temperature was the reaction the fastest / slowest.<br>
6. Draw a graph of temperature against time.<br>
Note: For most experiments, students are advise to not look directly down a test-tube, but look from the side!<br>

Common name: white vinegar (5%)<br>
Vinegar is a weak 4-5 % solution of acetic acid, C2H4O2.<br>
Pure acetic acid is a colourless liquid that solidifies to ice-like crystals in cold weather, so it is called "glacial" acetic acid.<br>
Acetic acid is a weak acid, but, like citric acid and tartaric acid, it forms carbon dioxide with chalk, baking soda, and forms hydrogen with iron filings and zinc.<br>
Acetic acid is used in the manufacture of artificial silk, non-flam celluloid.<br>

Experiment<br>
 A weak acid can dissolve the calcium in a bone or egg shell<br>
 1. The rubber chicken bone experiment.<br>
 Select a chicken bone, e.g. a "drumstick (tibia and fibula) or a "wishbone", furcula, the forked bone.<br>
 Clean any tissue off the bone, wash it with warm salt water and dry it.<br>
 Try to bend the bone between your fingers.<br>
 Cover a chicken bone with vinegar or dilute acid hydrochloric acid.<br>
 Change the solutions each day for 2 - 5 days.<br>
 The vinegar reacts with the calcium in the bone to form soluble calcium acetate.<br>
 Dry the bone with absorbent paper.<br>
 Try to bend the bone between your fingers.<br>
 The bone can be bent and even tied into a knot, because all the calcium has been removed.<br>
 CaCO3 + 2CH3COOH --> Ca(CH3COO)2 + H2O + CO2<br>
 2. The bouncy egg experiment<br>
 Cover a fresh egg with vinegar or dilute acid hydrochloric acid.<br>
 Change the solutions each day for 7 days.<br>
 Pick up the decalcified egg and drop it to show that it will bounce and not break.<br>
3. Decolorize vinegar<br>
Boil vinegar with decolorizing charcoal.<br>
Ordinary charcoal is not very successful.<br>
Neutralize vinegar with ammonia then half fill an evaporating basin with it and add a piece of litmus paper.<br>
Add dilute ammonia to the evaporating basin then stir the solution until the litmus paper turns blue.<br>
Transfer the liquid, now a solution of ammonium acetate, to a test-tube, add drops of hydrogen peroxide then heat the mixture until it boils.<br>
The brown colour of the solution disappears, destroyed by the oxygen from the hydrogen peroxide.<br>
Use the remaining liquid for the next experiment.<br>

Ethanedioic acid-2-water, C2H2O4, oxalic acid, colourless crystals (HOOC-COOH.2H2O).<br>
It occurs in many plants, e.g. rhubarb that can be used as a laxative.<br>
Experiment<br>
Be careful! This experiment must be done in a fume cupboard.<br>
The reaction will be violent, so use very small quantities of chemical.<br>
Add concentrated nitric acid to sucrose in a beaker.<br>
The sucrose starts dissolving.<br>
Heat the mixture in a fume cupboard.<br>
All the sucrose gradually dissolves.<br>
Meanwhile, the nitric acid decomposes to turn the solution yellow, and produces much white smoke.<br>
With the temperature rise, solution colour becomes deeper and a large amount of reddish brown gas is released.<br>
By controlling heating, evaporate the solution nearly to dryness, and volatilize the reddish brown gas as thoroughly as possible.<br>
Cool the beaker in water and snowflake like crystals of ethanedioic acid-2-water (oxalic acid) appear.<br>
Do not use an excessive quantity of nitric acid.<br>
Otherwise, the time for heating would be overlong and the nitric acid would not decompose completely, leading to a yellow product.<br>
sucrose + concentrated nitric acid --> dehydrated ethanedioic acid-2-water, (oxalic acid).<br>

 Materials can exist in three states: solid, liquid and gas.<br>
 You can change from one to another by altering temperature and / or pressure.<br>
 If you increase temperature and pressure enough, the distinction between liquid and gas will disappear at the critical point.<br>
 No phase boundary between liquid and gas exists, because at extremely high temperatures and pressures, the liquid and gaseous phases become indistinguishable.<br>
 The critical point of water is 374<sup>o</sup>C, 218 atmospheres of pressure.<br>
 At above 31.1<sup>o</sup>C and 72.9 atmospheres of pressure carbon dioxide behaves like liquid and like a gas.<br>
 It spreads out like a gas to fill the available space and can dissolve substances as if it was a liquid.<br>
 The low temperature is convenient, because it can be used with substances that would be damaged by the high temperature.<br>
Supercritical carbon dioxide is used to remove caffeine from tea and coffee, an extract substances from hops, essential oils, and environmental pollutants.<br>
 It is also used for dry cleaning.<br>
Supercritical carbon dioxide is used to extract caffeine from coffee beans, extract nicotine from tobacco, extract oil from oilseeds, e.g. soy bean and sunflower, extract the natural insecticide pyrethrins from the perennial plant pyrethrum, (Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium).

Diastase is a group of enzymes, α-amylase or β-amylase, or γ-amylase, that hydrolyses the breakdown of starch to maltose.<br>
Diastase was originally extracted from the barley mash used to brew beer.<br>
Diastase occurs in seeds and in the pancreas.<br>
Taka-diastase from, (Aspergillus oryzae) powder is sold to laboratories for research.<br>
Experiments<br>

Germinate barley grains on damp filter paper until the shoots begin to emerge.<br>
Crush the shoots with a mortar and pestle, add 50 mL of water then filter.<br>

Add an equal quantity of the unboiled or boiled diastase extract to the two test-tubes.<br>
Periodically take a drop of the mixture from each tube and test its reaction with dilute iodine on a white tile.<br>
At first, the blue-black starch colour occurs in both test-tubes.<br>
However, this colour in the test-tube containing unboiled enzyme is soon replaced by reddish colours.<br>
Then finally, it is replaced by  no colour, showing that starch has been converted to simpler substances, mostly to sugars.<br>
The temporary production of red colours occurs, because of the formation of intermediate substances, e.g. dextrin.<br>
The mixture containing boiled enzyme will continue to give the starch reaction.<br>
Apply the Fehling's test to each test-tube.<br>
The above experiment will proceed faster if the tubes are placed in a water bath at a temperature of 30<sup>o</sup>C to 40<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
Compare the time required for the reaction to reach completion at room temperature and at the higher temperature.<br>
3. Diastase is an amylase that acts on starch and breaks it into simple sugars.<br>
Working concentrations suggested by the supplier: 5 mL starch (1%), 5 mL diastase (1%).<br>
To monitor the progress of the reaction, place 2 drops iodine solution in each of 6 tile wells.<br>
Immediately after you mix the starch and diastase, transfer 2 drops of the mixture to the first well.<br>

 If the solution turns purple, protein is present in the sample.<br>
 2. Add an equal volume of 1% potassium hydroxide solution + a few drops of 1% copper sulfate solution to the sample solution.<br>
 If the solution turns purple, protein is present in the sample.<br>
 3. Add an equal volume of 40% sodium hydroxide solution to any protein solution, e.g. egg albumin, dried milk, gelatine.<br>
 Add drops of dilute copper (II) sulfate solution with a light blue colour.<br>
 The reaction produces a violet colour.<br>
4. Biuret test using biuret<br>
 Biuret, NH2CONHCONH2, is formed from heated urea, and crystallizes as NH2CONHCONH2.H2O.<br>
 An alkaline solution of biuret gives red-violet colour with copper (II) sulfate solution, because of reaction with peptide bonds.<br>
However, but no  reaction if the solution contains amino acids.<br>
 The concentration of the colour is proportional to the amount of protein (Beer-Lambert law), so the biuret test is almost quantitative.<br>
 If the sample contains soluble protein, the reagent turns from light blue to purple. but if the reagent remains light blue, the sample does not contain protein.<br>
 The biuret test detects peptide bonds between amino acids.<br>
 5. Prepare biuret solution with potassium hydroxide, copper (II) sulfate and potassium sodium tartrate (KNaC4H4O6.4H2O).<br>
 If the blue reagent turns violet it has detected proteins.<br>

For each successive test, the blue colour decreases, because starch is being converted to glucose sugar.<br>
Saliva contains salivary amylase, (ptyalin), a catalyst that converts starch to the simple sugar maltose and water.<br>
2. Put 3 drops of the starch and saliva solution into a test-tube.<br>
Add 3 mL of Fehling's solution and heat the solution until almost boiling.<br>
Note the colour of the precipitate.<br>
For each successive drop of starch and saliva solution test at 5 minute intervals.<br>
The brick-red precipitate increases, showing that the amount of glucose sugar is increasing.<br>
The enzyme salivary amylase in the saliva is breaking down starch into glucose sugar.<br>
3. Remove a drop of the starch and saliva solution and put it on a white tile.<br>
Put a drop of iodine solution on the drop of starch and saliva solution.<br>
Note the colour of the solution.<br>
For each successive drop taken out at each 5 minute interval, the blue colour decreases, showing that starch is being converted to glucose sugar.<br>
Wash the dropper between each test.<br>
 Tests for hydrolysis of starch<br>
 (C12H20O10)n + nH2O + H<sup>+</sup> --> nC12H22O11 + nH2O + H<sup>+</sup> --> 2nC6H12O6<br>
 starch --> maltose --> glucose<br>
Experiments<br>
 1. Put 10 mL of dilute starch solution into a test-tube.<br>
 Add to this 1 mL of saliva and stir this into the starch solution.<br>
 Record the time of adding the saliva.<br>
 At 5 minute intervals remove 3 drops by means of a dropper and put them on a clean white tile taking care to keep them from running into each other.<br>
 The dropper must be washed between each test.<br>
 Put some iodine solution on each drop.<br>
 The decreasing intensity of the blue colour shows the decreasing amount of starch.<br>
 2. To test for increasing amounts of sugar, put 3 drops of the reaction mixture into a small test-tube.<br>
 Add 3 mL of Fehling's solution and heat this mixture almost to boiling point.<br>
 The test should show that there is more sugar after boiling.<br>
 3. Boil cut potato in water then let cool.<br>
 Filter the solution to separate the soluble amylase from the insoluble amylopectin of the starch grains.<br>
 Add tincture of iodine to the filtered starch solution An intense blue colour occurs.<br>
 The solution contains beta-amylase, C6H10O5 that forms a complex with iodine: (beta-amylase)p (I<sup>-</sup>) (I2)r(H2O)s [where r &lt; p &lt; s].<br>
 Salivary amylase enzyme breaks down starch into the reducing sugars (+)glucose and maltose.<br>
 Reducing sugars do not react with iodine solution and starch does not react with Fehling's solution.<br>
 The sugars reduce copper (II) in Fehling's solution to brick-red copper (I) oxide.<br>
 4. Prepare a clear solution of laundry starch by adding a mixture of 1g starch in 10 ml of water to 500 mL of boiling water.<br>
Leave the solution to cool to room temperature.<br>
 5. Put 10 mL of dilute starch solution into a test-tube.<br>
 Add to this 1 mL of saliva and stir this into the starch solution.<br>
 Record the time of adding the saliva.<br>
 After 2 minutes use a dropper to put 2 drops of the solution on a white tile.<br>
 At 5 minute intervals, remove 3 drops with a dropper and put them on a clean white tile taking care to keep them from running into each other.<br>
 The dropper must be washed between each test.<br>
6. To test for starch, add iodine solution and note the intensity of the blue black colour.<br>
 The decreasing intensity of the blue colour shows the decreasing amount of starch.<br>
 7. To test for increasing amounts of sugar, put 3 drops of the reaction mixture into a small test-tube.<br>
 Add Fehling's No. 1 and No. 2 solutions and heat this mixture almost to boiling point.<br>
 Note the intensity of the brick-red colour increasing with time.<br>
 Repeat the experiment every 2 minutes with clean droppers.<br>
 Note the decreasing intensity of the blue colour that shows that starch is being used up.<br>
 Keep doing the test until it shows that there is more sugar after boiling.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.5.5H">9.5.5</a> Tests for starch in potato tuber cells<br>
 Scrape the cut surface of a potato tuber.<br>
 Put a scraping as big as a pin head in a drop of water on a microscope slide and apply a coverslip.<br>
 Examine the tissue under the low power.<br>
 Put a drop of iodine solution on the microscope slide to touch one side of the coverslip.<br>
 Touch a piece of absorbent paper to the other side of the coverslip to draw the iodine solution across.<br>
 Keep looking down the microscope and see the starch grains turning blue.<br>
 Examine the starch grains in the cells under high power.<br>
 Focus up and down on a starch grain to see the layers.<br>
 Examine other examples of starch grains, e.g. bean seed, rice grain.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.5.6H">9.5.6</a> Tests for starch, iodine tests<br>
Iodine is scarcely soluble in water, so iodine solution is iodine dissolved in potassium iodide solution.<br>
To make iodine solution, I2/ KI, dissolve 15 g of potassium iodide in 20 mL of water.<br>
Then dissolve 3 g of iodine crystals in this solution and make up to 1 litre with demineralized water.<br>
Use safety glasses and nitrile chemical-resistant gloves when weighing solid iodine, because it is harmful and corrosive.<br>
Once in solution, the amounts of iodine used are minute.<br>
Different starches contain different proportions of amylose and amylopectin, both polymers of glucose.<br>
Amylose gives the deep blue colour. but amylopectin gives a red-brown colour.<br>
Tincture of iodine antiseptic is a solution of iodine in ethanol.<br>
Store an iodine container inside a second container, because the lid of the iodine container may deteriorate.<br>
 When testing for the enzyme digestion of starch, when starch is present, iodine is dark blue.<br>
 If the blue colour lightens or disappears, this indicates starch is breaking down.<br>
 Factors such as temperature, pH and concentration can affect the rate of breakdown of starch.<br>
 However, how to quantify the degree of breakdown, remains a problem.<br>

<b>Be Careful!</b> Heat alcohol with an electric heater or use a water bath.<br>
 Do NOT use a Bunsen burner!<br>
Experiments<br>
 1. Boil a half full test-tube of water.<br>
 Add 1 g of powdered laundry starch and continue boiling.<br>
 Cool the solution then add drops of iodine solution.<br>
 The liquid appears black. but if hold it up to the light it appears dark blue.<br>
 Pour out half the solution then reheat the test-tube.<br>
 The blue colour disappears.<br>
 Cool the test-tube under a water tap.<br>
 The blue colour reappears.<br>
2. Boil cut potato in water then let cool.<br>
Filter the solution to separate the soluble amylase from the insoluble amylopectin of the starch grains.<br>
Add tincture of iodine to the filtered starch solution.<br>
An intense blue colour occurs.<br>
The solution contains β-amylase, C6H10O5, forms a complex with iodine: (β-amylase)p (I<sup>-</sup>), (I2)r(H2O)s [where r &lt; p&lt; s].<br>
3. Do the iodine test for starch on a solution of glucose.<br>
 Pure glucose sugar does not react with iodine solution.<br>
 Iodine is poisonous and should not be used where food is being prepared.<br>
4. Sugar, the products of photosynthesis, and the large starch molecules formed from many sugar molecules are present in leaves.<br>
 For a simple starch test add a dilute iodine solution and note the typical blue-black colour that shows that starch is present.<br>
 Use tubers, potatoes or a starch paste to show the colour change.<br>
5. When testing leaves softening the leaf cells by boiling in water for a few minutes is necessary.<br>
 Then the leaf is put in boiling alcohol until the pigments that will mask the reactions are removed from the leaf.<br>
 Chlorophyll is usually removed in 5-8 minutes, but fleshy leaves may take longer or need a change of alcohol for removal of pigments.<br>
 The iodine solution should react with the starch within 15 minutes.<br>
6. Purchase: Iodine, trace metals basis, I2.<br>
Purchase: Potassium iodide, ACS reagent, 99.0%, KI.<br>
Store iodine container inside a second container, because the lid of the iodine container may deteriorate.<br>
Iodine is scarcely soluble in water, so iodine solution is iodine dissolved in potassium iodide solution.<br>
Use safety glasses and nitrile gloves when weighing solid iodine, because it is harmful and corrosive.<br>
Once in solution the amounts of iodine used are minute.<br>
Specific tests for starch giving blue-black colour and general stain.<br>
Iodine solution kills and fixes living material and makes cytoplasm and nucleus more visible.<br>
Lignin walls in xylem stained brown, leaving cellulose walls of parenchyma relatively unstained.<br>
Stains proteins brown, nuclei dark brown, chloroplasts brown, but black if starch present, cellulose cell walls yellow, lignified cell walls deep yellow to brown.<br>
