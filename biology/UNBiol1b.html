 "Illusion Science Pack", (toy product), over 20 optical illusion activities<br>
Optical illusions caused by disturbance of light between objects and the eyes are different from illusions caused by the disturbance of sensory signals of the eye.<br>
Cognitive illusions are caused by misapplied knowledge employed by the brain to interpret or read sensory signals are quite different.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Prof. Richard Langton Gregory (1923-2010), England, has classified optical illusions as follows:<br> 
 1. Ambiguity illusions<br>
 Optical disturbance intervening between the object and the retina.<br>
<a href="../images/9.246.2.gif">See diagram 9.246.2</a>: Necker cube illusion.<br>
 2. Distortion illusions<br>
 Disturbed neural sensory signals, mirages, perspective problems, human eye astigmatism<br>
<a href="../images/9.122.2.gif">See diagram 9.122.2</a>: Bent stick illusion.<br>
<a href="../images/9.127.2.gif">See diagram 9127.2</a>: Spoon in water illusion.<br>
3. Paradox illusions<br>
 How to make sense of neural signals.<br>
<a href="../images/9.247.5.jpg">See diagram 9.247.5</a>: Impossible triangle, Penrose triangle<br>
 4. Fiction illusions<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.246.1H">9.246.1</a> Absent square illusion<br>
Absent square illusion, Kanizsa triangle illusion, square that is not there illusion<br>
<a href="../images/9.246.1.gif">See diagram 9.246.1</a>: Absent square illusion, Kanizsa triangle illusion.<br>
 In the Absent square illusion and Kanizsa triangle illusion the brain 
creates illusory contours.<br>
 The human brain tries to make sense of all sense perceptions, even to "seeing"
a square that is not there!<br>
 Some illusions are caused by the brain "'postulating" a nearer occluding
 surface, to "explain" surprising gaps.<br>
 A cut-out square in black paper has the illusion of being a white square
 on top of black paper.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.122.2H">9.122.2</a> Bent stick illusion<br>
<a href="../images/9.122.2.gif">See diagram 9.122.2</a>: Bent stick illusion.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.127.2H">9.127.2</a> Spoon in water illusion<br>
<a href="../images/9.127.2.gif">See diagram 9.127.2</a>: Spoon in water illusion.<br>
When the spoon leans against the side of the glass, the light from the spoon hits the water at an angle so it is refracted or bent, and the part of the spoon under water appears in a different location.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.246.2H">9.246.2</a> Necker cube illusion<br>
<a href="../images/9.246.2.gif">See diagram 9.246.2</a>: Necker cube illusion.<br>
 In this line drawing do you see the lower left square in front or the upper
right square in front?<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.246.3H">9.246.3</a> Ghost coin illusion<br>
<a href="../images/9.246.3.gif">See diagram 9.246.3</a>: Ghost coin.<br>
 Grip two coins between the tips of the index fingers held vertically.<br>
 Rub the coins against each other with rapid up and down movements.<br>
 A third ghost coin appears between and below the real coins.<br>
 The retina retains images on the real coins in their lower position.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.246.4H">9.246.4</a> Fraser spiral illusion<br>
 Fraser spiral, false spiral, twisted cord illusion<br>
<a href="../images/9.246.4.gif">See diagram 9.246.4</a>: Fraser spiral illusion.<br>
Apparent spiral.<br>
 Overlapping arcs appear to form a spiral, but the arcs are concentric 
circles.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.246.5H">9.246.5</a> Hermann Grid illusion<br>
<a href="../images/9.246.5.gif">See diagram 9.246.5</a>: Hermann Grid illusion.<br>
Ludimar Hermann, Germany, (1833-1914)<br>
 Dark patches appear in the street crossings, except the ones which you
 are directly looking at.<br>
 Look at the 16 black squares in the diagram and note that the white bars
between the black squares appear whites than where the 
 white bars intersect where dark areas appear on the intersections.<br>
 However, if you look closely at the intersections and not at the black 
squares the dark area disappear.<br>
 White contrasted with black appears whiter when we use your peripheral
 vision.<br>
 Look at the black and white discs in the squares.<br>
 The white discs appear larger.<br>
 White objects appear larger when contrasted with a black background.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.246.6H">9.246.6</a> Count the boxes illusion<br>
<a href="../images/9.246.6.gif">See diagram 9.246.6</a>: Count the boxes.<br>
 The same drawing of a pile of boxes seen inverted changes the number of
boxes.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.246.7H">9.246.7</a> Slice of pie illusion<br>
<a href="../images/9.246.7.gif">See diagram 9.246.7</a>: Slice of pie.<br>
 A slice of pie is missing in the top diagram, but it reappears in the 
bottom diagram.<br>
 However, the bottom diagram could also show a pie with a slice cut out.<br>
 We never see a pie with a slice missing from this angle, unless we looked
 up through a glass table, so we are happy to accept the 
 bottom diagram as the missing slice of pie.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.246.8H">9.246.8</a> Vertical- horizontal illusion<br>
<a href="../images/9.246.8.png">See diagram 9.246.8</a>: Vertical-horizontal.<br>
 The brain overestimates the length of a vertical line relative to a horizontal
 line, but both are the same length.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.246.9H">9.246.9</a> Blivet illusion<br>
<a href="../images/9.246.9.png">See diagram 9.246.9</a>: Blivet, devil's fork.<br>
The word "blivet" has different meanings, but here it means an impossible figure.<br>
 The brain switches perception of a two-pronged fork or three-pronged fork.<br>
 In this series of optical illusions is where an artist does a perspective drawing and crosses over
 some of the lines at one end to get a pseudo view as well.<br>
Usually they start with a drawing of a tuning fork, as in the devil's fork.<br>
For example: <a href="../images/9.246.9.png">See diagram 9.255</a>: Four or three bars?<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.247.1H">9.247.1</a> Reversible figures illusion<br>, 
Rubin vase illusion<br>
Edgar Rubin, Denmark, (1886-1951).
<a href="../images/9.247.1.jpg">See diagram 9.247.1</a>: Rubin vase.<br>
 A figure-ground illusion, the figures and ground compete to produce the
profiles of two heads or a vase.<br>
 For most people the image fluctuates between the two although the image
 on the retina remains constant.<br>
 The perception by the brain keeps switching figure and background.<br>
 The primary decision the brain has to make is which shapes are objects 
and which are spaces between objects.<br>
 The brain wants closure, but the brain cannot make up its mind!<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.247.2H">9.247.2</a> Müller-Lyer illusion<br>
<a href="../images/9.246.8.png">See diagram 9.247.2</a>: Müller-Lyer illusion.<br>
 The shaft of the outgoing arrow-heads appears longer than the shaft for
the ingoing heads.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.247.3H">9.247.3</a> Impossible square illusion<br>
<a href="../images/9.247.5.jpg">See diagram 9.247.3</a>: Impossible square.<br>
 The surfaces and corners of the square are not in the same position as
in a normal square.<br>
 Try to draw an impossible square!<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.247.4H">9.247.4</a> Duck-rabbit illusion<br>
<a href="../images/9.247.4.jpg">See diagram 9.247.4</a>: Duck-rabbit.<br>
 The brain keeps switching from perception of a duck to perception of a rabbit.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.247.5H">9.247.5</a> Impossible triangle illusion<br>
Impossible triangle, Penrose triangle, Penrose tri-bar illusion<br>
<a href="../images/9.247.5.jpg">See diagram 9.247.5</a>: Impossible triangle.<br>
An "impossible triangle" can be constructed, so that by observing the construction it from a certain angle it gives the impression of being an impossible figure.<br>
 The lithograph print "Belvedere" by M. C. Escher, 1958, Holland, shows a building that is an impossible object.<br>
<a href="../images/Belvedere.jpg">See diagram</a>: "Belvedere".<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.247.7H">9.247.7</a> Young girl-old woman illusion<br>
<a href="../images/9.247.7.gif">See diagram 9.247.7</a>: Young girl-old woman.<br>
 The chin of the young girl is the nose of the old woman.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.247.8H">9.247.8</a> Barberpole illusion<br>
<a href="../images/9.247.8.gif">See diagram 9.247.8</a>: Barberpole illusion.<br>
 A diagonally-striped pole is turned around its vertical axis.<br>
 The stripes appears to move up or down.<br>
 The original custom was for barbers to dry the bandages used in blood 
letting by wrapping them around a pole.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.247.9H">9.247.9</a> Cloud shapes illusion<br>
 Hamlet by William Shakespeare, Act 3 Scene 2<br>
 "Hamlet: Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?<br>
 Polonius: By th' mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.<br>
 Hamlet: Methinks it is like a weasel.<br>
 Polonius: It is backed like a weasel.<br>
 Hamlet: Or like a whale.<br>
 Polonius: Very like a whale.<br>
 Hamlet: Then I will come to my mother by and by.<br>
 They fool me to the top of my bent. - I will come by and by."<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.248.1H">9.248.1</a> Ebbinghaus illusion<br>
<a href="../images/9.248.1.gif">See diagram 9.248.1</a>: Ebbinghaus illusion.<br>
Hermann Ebbinghaus, Germany (1850–1909).<br>
An optical illusion of relative size perception.<br> 
The central circle surrounded by large circles appears smaller than the central circle surrounded by small circles, but the two central circles are the same size.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.248.2H">9.248.2</a> Ponzo figure illusion<br>
<a href="../images/9.248.1.gif">See diagram 9.248.2</a>: Ponzo figure.<br>
A geometrical-optical illusion, Mario Ponzo, Italy, (1882–1960).<br>
Judging an object's size based on its background.<br>
Perception of background influences perception of foreground.<br>
The upper of the parallel lines is expanded with respect to the lower, showing the perspective significance of converging lines, 
e.g. railway rails.<br>

 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.248.3H">9.248.3</a> Poggendorf illusion<br>
<a href="../images/9.248.1.gif">See diagram 9.248.3</a>: Poggendorf illusion.<br>
Johann Christian Poggendorff, Germany, (1796 – 1877)<br>
 A straight line crossing a rectangle appears displaced.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.248.4H">9.248.4</a> Spinning picture illusion<br>
Spinning picture, thaumatrope illusion, persistence of vision illusion<br>
<a href="../images/28.143.gif">See diagram 28.143</a>: Spinning picture.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.248.5H">9.248.5</a> Bending pencil illusion<br>
 Hold one end of a pencil between the thumb and forefinger.<br>
 Extend the arm, hold the pencil loosely and parallel to the eyes.<br>
 Shake the pencil up and down very vigorously by a vertical distance of five cm.<br>
 The pencil appears to bend.<br>
This illusion may be caused by persistence of vision, but perhaps the eye movements of the observer do not track the motions of parts of the shaken object.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.248.6H">9.248.6</a> Size-weight illusion<br>
Size-weight illusion, tactile illusion<br>
 The smaller object feels heavier, although both are the same scale weight.<br>
 Larger objects are generally heavier than small objects so the muscles
 are set in this expectation.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.248.7H">9.248.7</a> Moving window illusion<br>
 When observing objects and features of the countryside from the window 
of a moving vehicle, closer objects and features appear to 
 move faster than those further away.<br>
 Further object have a smaller angular velocity than closer objects, so
they take longer to pass through the field of vision.<br>
 Look at text between the V formed by two stretched fingers of your hand
 flat on the page.<br>
 Move your hand across the page and observe the letters closer to the hand
within the V appearing to move faster than the letters 
 between the fingertips.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.248.8H">9.248.8 </a>Afterimages illusion<br>
 Afterimages illusions are caused by local loss of retinal visual pigments 
 following intense or prolonged stimulation.<br>
 The three types of colour receptor cones are most sensitive to red, blue
or green.<br>
 The cones get fatigued when you stare at a particular colour.<br>
 Then when you look at the white background, the colour receptors are not
in balance and you see the colour "afterimages."<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.254.1H">9.254.1</a> Retention of image illusion<br>
<a href="../images/9.254.1.jpg">See diagram 9.254.1</a>: Retention of image (University of Melbourne).<br>
 Retention of image.<br>
 Two rings tilted with respect to each other are joined at a common point.<br>
 When the rings are placed upon the turntable and rotated it appears that
the rings are in rotation with respect to each other.<br>
