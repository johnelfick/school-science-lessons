<a href="../images/9.3.35.gif">See diagram 9.3.35</a>: Protozoa.<br>
The term protozoa has been abandoned by scientists in favour of the term protist meaning any eukaryotic organism that is not an animal, plant, or fungus.<br>
Protists do not form a natural group, but are a paraphyletic assemblage of similar-appearing. but diverse taxa, said to be members of the Kingdom Protista.<br>
<a href="#9.7.0H">9.7.0</a> Kingdom Protista (protists)<br>
The old classification of Phylum protozoa:<br>
 Protozoa are single-celled (unicellular), but may be colonial if no division of functions.<br>
 Gas exchange and excretion is by diffusion.<br>
 Osmoregulation in freshwater forms is by a contractile vacuole.<br>
 Asexual reproduction is by binary fission and sometimes sexual reproduction by conjugation occurs.<br>

Porifera, (Latin <i>porus</i> pore, and <i>ferre</i>, to bear), mostly marine in tidal zones attached to submerged rocks. body of two layers, water enters in the body through many pores into the central body cavity, skeleton composed of collagen spongin and calcium carbonate or silica, filter feeders.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.1.3H">9.1.3</a> Phylum Coelenterata<br>
Phylum Coelenterata (Phylum Ctenophora, comb jellies, Phylum Cnidaria, jellyfish, sea anemones)<br>
Classification of Coelenterata<br>
(Modern taxonomists use the following phyla instead of Phylum Coelenterata: Phylum Ctenophora, comb jellies, Phylum Cnidaria, jellyfish, sea anemones)<br>
Phylum Coelenterata, (Greek koilos hollow, Ã©nteron, intestine), are mostly marine colonial organisms, with two cell layers, ectoderm and endoderm, separated by jelly-like mesogloea, have radial symmetry, hollow cup-like body (enteron cavity), with only one entrance, tentacles around the mouth, independent stinging cells not connected to the network nervous system.<br>
Coelenterata have two body forms:<br>
The hydroid form is a sedentary polyp.<br>
The medusa form is a plankton jellyfish-like organism.<br>
1. Class Hydrozoa, have polyp and medusa forms in the life cycle Order Hydrida<br>
e.g. Hydra, is one of the few freshwater species<br>
<a href="../images/9.37.4.gif">See diagram 9.37.4</a> Hydra.<br>
Obelia forms a colony of hollow tubes attached to seaweed with polyp heads, hydranths, specialized either for feeding or for reproducing by medusa buds.<br>
<a href="../images/9.37.7.gif">See diagram 9.37.7</a> Obelia.<br>
Order Siphonophora, marine pelagic with apical float, pneumatophore e.g. Physalia, "Portuguese man-of-war"<br>
<a href="../images/9.37.6.gif">See diagram 9.37.6</a> Physalia, "Portuguese man-of-war".<br>
In Australia, it is commonly called a "bluebottle", where the dactylozoids detach in the water off the surfing beaches and surfers are stung by the nematocysts.<br>
2. Class Scyphozoa, jellyfish, medusa form is the main stage in the life cycle, e.g. Aurelia<br>
<a href="../images/9.37.5.gif">See diagram 9.37.5</a> Aurelia jellyfish.<br>
The "jellyfish", which may be classified as Phylum Cnidaria, subphylum Medusozoa, refers only to the medusa phase of the life cycle.<br>
Some aquariums use the term "sea jellies"instead of "jellyfish", because it is not a "fish".<br>
3. Class Anthozoa (Actinozoa), only the polyp stage in the life cycle, Order Alcyonaria, corals,<br>
e.g. Red coral, Corallium rubrum, Order Zoantharia<br>
e.g. Sea anemone, Actinia equina.<br>

<a href="../biology/UNBiol2.html#9.1.12H">9.1.12H </a>Tapeworm diseases, Class Cestoda<br>
Classification of Platyhelminthes<br>
Many Platyhelminthes are parasites of humans and other animals.<br>
To control these parasites, their life cycle can be broken by killing the hosts or parasites in the host, thoroughly cooking food that contain parasites, and sanitary disposal of human and animal wastes.<br>
Make sure that children wash their hands thoroughly after handling cats and dogs.<br>
Platyhelminthes have a dorsiventrally-flattened body (flattened from above), bilateral symmetry (head, tail, left and right sides), three cell layers: (ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm), but no body cavity.<br>
Both sex organs are present in the one organism (hermaphrodite).<br>
They have a primitive brain and paired ventral nerve cords.<br>
The three classes of platyhelminthes are as follows:<br>
1. Class Turbellaria, planarians, are free-living flatworms with simple anterior eyes and can replace lost body parts (regeneration).<br>
They move with cilia and rhythmical muscle contraction to scavenge detritus.<br>
2. Class Trematoda, flukes, have a complex attaching devices of suckers and sometimes hooks.<br>
They attach themselves to the interior of the host and suck in blood and mucus with a muscular pharynx.<br>
Cat liver fluke (Opisthorchiasis felineus)<br>
Chinese liver fluke (Clonorchis sinensis)<br>
Lung fluke (Paragonimus westermani)<br>
Schistosoma fluke (Schistosoma mansoni, S. japonicum), bilharzia, schistosomiasis disease, infection by skin penetration, parasite in freshwater snails<br>
Sheep liver fluke (Fasciola hepatica)<br>
<a href="../images/9.37.1.gif">See diagram 9.37.1</a>: Fasciola hepatica.<br>
3. Class Cestoda, tapeworms, attach to the gut wall of host by an attaching device (scolex) with hooks and suckers.<br>
The body is divided into segments (proglottids) that are continually produced behind the scolex.<br>
They remain attached to the interior of the hosts digestive system and absorb the pre digested food.<br>

<a href="#9.9.1.0H">9.9.1.0</a> Order Diptera, Drosophila<br>
Fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster), vinegar fly, deposits eggs on rotting ripe fruit.<br>
The species has its origins in the woodlands of south-central Africa, where it relied heavily on the marula fruit, Sclerocarya birreaica.<br>
The âtrueâ fruit flies, tephritid flies, are larger and more colourful and attack fruit before it rots.<br> 
Drosophila flies may be abundant in wineries, stone fruit orchards and banana plantations during harvest.<br> 
They are small, easy to feed, have a very quick life cycle and can produce hundreds of offspring.<br>
The Drosophila life cycle lasts approximately 10 days at 25Â°Cm and a single fertile female can lay hundreds of eggs.<br>
Drosophila embryogenesis lasts approximately 24 hours.<br>
Drosophila melanogaster that genes were found to be bundled up in chromosomes, when its genome was sequenced in the 1990s.<br> 
Fruit flies have been crucial in mapping the molecular interactions involved in allowing cells to migrate and stitch together to repair tissue damage.<br>
Drosophila melanogaster has contributed directly to disease control.<br>
Wolbachia bacteria isolated from this species are used to suppress the transmission of dengue disease and other human viral diseases transmitted by mosquitoes.<br>
A strain of Wolbachia living inside the tissues of fruit flies and passed from mother to offspring was transferred through microinjection to Aedes mosquitoes.<br>
The Wolbachia bacteria interact with viruses in such a way as to prevent viral build-up in the salivary gland of the mosquitoes.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.9.6H">9.9.6</a> Wolbachia bacteria, sterilized mosquito trial<br>
This breakthrough could support the suppression and potential eradication of Aedes aegypti worldwide.<br>
The landmark trial involved releasing three million male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in Northern Queensland, sterilised Wolbachia bacteria.<br>
The sterile male insects search out and mate with wild females, preventing the production of offspring.<br>
Scientists returned the following year and found one of the trial sites, Mourilyan in Queensland, was almost devoid of mosquitoes.<br>
CSIRO scientist Professor Nigel Beebe, said the trial demonstrates this technique is capable of effectively suppressing mosquito populations.<br>
âDuring the trial, we saw over 80 per cent of the mosquito population suppressed across our three trial sites.<br>
The following year, the suppression was still in effect, with 97 % reduction of Aedes aegypti.<br>
One year on, the mosquito population at the second trial site remained substantially suppressed, while the population fully recovered at the third site.<br>
The technique can also be used to remove the virus-transmitting Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, in the Torres Strait Islands.<br>

Myxomycota are fungi-like organisms that may move around like an amoeba or a blob called a plasmodium.<br> 
They live on decomposing vegetation and they consume bacteria.<br>
They may be seen as creeping and crawling threads of âslimeâ in their motile stage.<br> 
However, as food becomes scarce, these threads come together and form a fruiting body that produces spores.<br>  
The fruiting body may be irregular clumps, small balls or regular pin or feather-shaped structures joined together.<br>

Taxons are the ranks used in biology classification:<br>
Taxonomic rank: domain kingdom phylum (zoology), (division : botany) class order family genus species<br>
Taxons are based on the Linnean sequence, Carolus Linnaeus 1707-1778, published in "Systema Naturae" in 1735.<br>
A taxon at the rank of Division is the second highest taxonomic classification for the kingdoms Plantae (plants) and fungi.<br>
In biology, Division is between Kingdom level and Class level.<br>
Taxonomy, systematics, is the classification of living and extinct organisms.<br>

<a href="../images/9.38.1.gif">See diagram 9.38.1</a>: Amoeba<br>
Amoeba proteus is a single cell, aquatic, organism that is constantly changing shape.<br>
The cytoplasm consists of clear jelly-like ectoplasm and granular endoplasm.<br>
A clear rounded area, contractile vacuole, expands and contracts as it collects and expels water to maintain the concentration of the cytoplasm.<br>
A central nucleus controls all the activities.<br>
It moves by forming a pseudopodium (false foot), by the endoplasm flowing into the ectoplasm.<br>
The amoeba flows into the pseudopodium which may be anchored to the substrate by the outer membrane, pellicle or plasma lemma, becoming sticky.<br>
Amoeba feeds on small organisms by flowing around them and enclosing them in a food vacuole, where they are digested.<br>
Reproduction is by simple binary fission, when the amoeba splits into two.<br>
Amoeba avoids dry conditions by forming a spore with an external cyst wall.<br>
Entamoeba species have no contractile vacuole possibly, because the live as parasites in vertebrates.<br>
They have only one or two large blunt pseudopodia.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.10.2H">9.10.2</a> Entamoeba coli, Phylum Rhizopoda<br>
Entamoeba coli lives in human large intestine, feeding on bacteria and remains of digested food, commensal parasite and is harmless.<br>
It may have up to 8 nuclei when it divides inside a cyst in the faeces.<br>
Infection occurs after ingestion of cysts in fecally-contaminated food or water.<br>
In the small intestine, the cysts break open to release sporozoan trophozoites, which migrate to the large intestine, absorb nutrients, grow and multiply to form cysts.<br>

The Coniferophyta, or Pinophyta, or Coniferae, commonly known as conifers, are vascular land plants containing a single class, Pinopsida.<br>
Conifers are cone-bearing seed plants, a subset of gymnosperms, perennial woody plants with secondary growth.<br>
Conifers include the pine, fir, spruce, other cone-bearing trees and shrubs, and yews<br>
Coniferophyta, Pinophyta, conifers are seed-bearing plants with ovules on the edge of an open sporophyll.<br>
The sporophylls are arranged in cone-like structures.<br>
<br>
Conifers are pyramidal or conical trees with long straight stems that taper to an apical growing point, the leader.<br>
The almost horizontal branches bear narrow needle-shaped leaves.<br>
The original tap root dies leaving shallow roots that let the tree be blown over by storms.<br>
Smaller roots have no root hairs, but have a sheath of fungus that penetrates into the root epidermis.<br>
Small microspore cones at the ends of branches produce microspores, pollen grains.<br>
Large megaspore cones are made up of leaf-like sporophylls that contain the ova.<br>
The fertilized ova develop to form seeds released when the woody cone opens.<br>
Most conifers produce woody cones by lignification of the seed-bearing sporophylls, but Juniperus, Podocarpus and Taxus have soft fruit.<br>

<br>
Experiments<br>
1. Look for a microspore cone, pollen grain, pollen tube, microsporophyll, microspores (pollen) megasporophyll, micropyle, ovule, megaspore, and bract.<br>
2. Examine twigs of Pinus in summer.<br>
The twigs should show evidence of at least three years' growth.<br>
Observe the structure of purely vegetative twigs, the position and structure of seed cones of varying age, the position and structure of staminate cones.<br>
3. Examine the male and female cones of Pinus.<br>
Dig up some shallow roots and examine the mycorrhiza under the microscope.<br>
Dissect first year, second year and third year seed cones and note their general structure.<br>
Note the seeds lying naked on the cone scales.<br>
4. Remove a megasporophyll from a first year cone and look for the two megasporangia (ovules) on the upper surface.<br>
The bract scale is on the lower surface.<br>
5. Examine the structure in longitudinal section under high power.<br>
6. Examine a sporophyll from a second year cone in the same way.<br>
7. Examine a third year cone.<br>
Remove a megasporophyll and note the seeds with their wings attached.<br>
Cut a longitudinal section through a seed and examine under low power.<br>
8. Dissect a staminate cone and note the form of the microsporophylls (stamens).<br>
Crush one of them into a drop of glycerine and examine the pollen grains under high power.<br>
Examine transverse and longitudinal sections of staminate cones.<br>
9. Examine the structure of the current year stem and the older stems by means of transverse and longitudinal sections.<br>
Examine the tracheids, the sieve tubes, the medullary rays and the resin canals.<br>
10. Cut a transverse section of a leaf.<br>
<br>
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.11.1H">9.11.1</a><br>Marchantiophyta Experiments<br>
 1. Collect plants from moist sheltered places, e.g. behind waterfalls, in cooler periods of the year.<br>
 2. Collect plants of Pellia in the early spring.<br>
 Observe the leafy gametophyte with rhizoids at its base and the capsule or sporogonium.<br>
 Note the presence of dark green globular capsules just behind the growing points of some thallus branches.<br>
 Also, note small warty prominences further back from the tip and either side of the midrib.<br>
 These prominences are old antheridia cavities, now empty.<br>
 Dissect out a sporogonium, noting the short seta.<br>
 Crush the capsule into a drop of water.<br>
 Observe the wall with its characteristic thickenings, the spores and the elaters.<br>
 Cut a transverse section of the thallus, mount in water and note the structure, similar to the lamina of Fucus, but attached to the soil, with hair-like rhizoids.<br>
<br>
 3. Collect Pellia plants in the early summer.<br>
 Observe the presence of antheridia and cut sections through the thallus where they occur.<br>
 Note also involucres just behind the tips of some branches and cut longitudinal sections through these to see the archegonia.<br>
 Look for the thallus, gemma cups, rhizoids, sperm with two flagella, male thallus, antheridium, female thallus, and archegonium.<br>
 Liverworts are the most lowly land plants with single-celled rhizoids and no clearly-differentiated stem and leaves.<br>
 They grow in moist shady habitats on wet rocks or near shallow streams, usually clumped together to save moisture.<br>
 The plant is the gametophyte generation, a broad branching thallus.<br>
 Together the plants look like little leaves clumped together and attached to the damp soil by hair-like rhizoids.<br>
 The antheridia produce swimming sperm that fertilize an ovum in the archegonium to form the zygote that grows into the sporophyte.<br>
 The sporophyte has no chlorophyll and remains a sort of parasite with no connection to the soil, but attached to the archegonium.<br>
 It releases spores that develop into the next gametophyte generation.<br>
 Marchantia reproduces rapidly by vegetative buds produced in gemma cups.<br>
 The sexual organs, the antheridia and archegonia are formed on different plants.<br>
 Collect plants from moist sheltered places, e.g. behind waterfalls, in cooler periods of the year.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.2.5H">9.2.5</a> Moss experiments<br>
 1. Examine capsules of Funaria or other mosses at different stages of maturity and note the peristome and the method of liberation of spores.<br>
 If you fix a cut off capsule in wax, you can examine the peristome under low power.<br>
 Breath on the capsule to show the hygroscopic movements of the peristome teeth.<br>
<br>
 2. Collect protonema of Polytrichum from hedgerows or on the soil in flower pots.<br>
 Polytrichum spores germinate to form a filamentous stage called a protonema.<br>
 Later, buds form on the protonema to grow into the moss plant.<br>
 Polytrichum often mingles with Vaucheria, but Polytrichum is septate.<br>
 Observe the green filaments with transverse septa and the brownish rhizoids with oblique septa.<br>
 Observe buds on the green filaments and young plants in various stages of development.<br>
<br>
 3. Look for the male and female plant, female plant with attached sporogonium, leaves, stem, rhizoids, sporogonium capsule, sporogonium seta.<br>
 4. Collect common woodland mosses usually found in compact colonies or cushions in damp shady places.<br>
 Some grow on the damper side or south side of tree trunks and fence posts.<br>
 Observe the erect stems, small leaves, and the rhizoids that attach the plant to the soil.<br>
 Look for terminal cups, sexual organs, and tubular capsules that contain asexual spores.<br>
 Some tufts of plants bear rosette-like antheridia cups containing spores.<br>
 Note the structure of the antheridia and paraphyses, sterile hairs or filaments that bear the spore-making structures, the sporangia.<br>
 The archegonia cups that house the ovum are less conspicuous, so you may have to dissect more than one apex to find an archegonium.<br>
<br>
 5. Use four areas of activity: 1. field observations, 2. spore culture, 3. cultivation of gametophytes, 4. investigation of spore and leafy gametophyte growth to 
 study the times of spore discharge, growth of the protonema, leafy gametophyte production, sex organ production (archegonia and<br>antheridia), 
 fertilization, growth of sporophyte, relative importance of reproduction by spores or gemmae and tubers.<br>
 Use information on local temperatures, day length, rainfall, to relate to observations of life cycles.<br>
 6. The upper part of the moss capsule (sporangium) may be specialized for gradual spore discharge.<br>
 The life cycle of moss begins with asexual reproduction.<br>
 Leaf-like moss grow thin, brown stalk with capsules at the top.<br>
 The capsules contain tiny spores instead of sex cells.<br>
 Spores are the cells that can develop into a new individual without fertilization.<br>
 Mosses reproduce by means of spores which are dispersed from the mouth of the capsule by the numerous rays (orange and brown), that snap open.<br>
 Grow moss spores and study which factors of the environment controls germination, growth, differentiation of leafy gametophytes.<br>
Mature spore filled capsules are mostly available in the latter half of the year in the Southern Hemisphere.<br>
A problem is how to count the numbers of spores per capsule, per culture, or the number of leafy gametophytes that form.<br>
Leafy gametophytes grow from the protonema.<br>

1. Look for the Selaginella plant, cone, scale leaves, lateral leaves, rhizophores.<br>
Observe the microsporangia containing many microspores, and megasporangium containing four megaspores.<br>
 The Clubmoss have club-shaped cones that bear spores and are known as "fern allies".<br>
 Plants of the Selaginella genus, spikemoss, are small prostrate plants with four rows of small leaves on the axis.<br>
 They live in damp places.<br>
 Selaginella kraussiana and Selaginella martensii are grown in greenhouses.<br>
 The Selaginella plant is a sporophyte bearing microsporangia and megasporangia in the same cone.<br>
 A microsporangium produces microspores to be dropped onto damp soil and later eject a swimming sperm.<br>
 The larger megasporangium produces megaspores to be dropped onto the soil, germinate in rainy weather, and produce a female prothallus with an ovum inside.<br>
 The ovum is fertilized by the sperm to form a zygote that grows into the next sporophyte generation.<br>
 Both types of spores have a tri-radiate ridge from origin in the tetrads following meiosis.<br>
<br>
 Experiments<br>
 1. Collect the microspores and megaspores from a ripe cone and scatter the spores on moist absorbent paper.<br>

<br>
The stag's horn is a common epiphyte in rainforests.<br>
The asexual phase, the sporophyte, is the large fern that develops spores in sporangia.<br>
The sexual phase, the gametophyte, develops the sexual organs.<br>
It is an insignificant little plant like a little flat leaf, the size of a fingernail.<br>
Experiments<br>
 1. Examine Dryopteris, wood fern.<br>
 Note the rhizome and adventitious roots, stem and compound leaves, fronds.<br>
 Note the sori (singular: sorus) under the recurved fronds where spores are formed.<br>
 Dryopteris has rounded sori.<br>
 Pteridium has long sori along the margins of the pinnules.<br>
 Look for the sori under a leaf, compound leaf or frond, coiled young leaf, rhizome, and roots.<br>
 2. Cut a transverse section of a pinnule of Dryopteris to pass through a sorus.<br>
 Observe the tissues of the leaf, the placenta, sporangia in various stages of development in the indusium.<br>
 3. Dehiscence of fern sporangia Pteridium<br>
 Scrape some ripe sporangia into a drop of glycerine on a slide.<br>
 The glycerine withdraws water from the annulus cells and thus causes the opening of the sporangia.<br>
 You can slow the movements of the annulus with glycerine.<br>
 Scrape other sporangia on to a warm slide and observe the annulus movements under the microscope.<br>
 4. Fern prothallus Pteridium<br>
 To grow fern prothalli, place a soaked flower pot inside a larger one, packing the space between with wet sphagnum or peat.<br>
 Allow a mature frond bearing a sorus to dry on a piece of paper and then scatter the spores so obtained on the inner surface of the small flower pot.<br>
 Stand the pots in an inch or so of water and cover the top of the pots with a sheet of glass.<br>
 Green prothalli will soon appear, and you can observe successive stages in their development.<br>
 Observe the archegonia and the liberation of sperms from the antheridia.<br>
Young sporophytes will develop if you water the prothalli after they show archegonia.<br>
