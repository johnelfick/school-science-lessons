<a href=https://www.csiro.au/en/research/natural-environment/ecosystems/Blue-green-algae/What-are-blue-green-algae<br>
<a href="../topics/topic16e.html#16.3.5.2.6H">16.3.5.2.6</a> Phycobilin, phycocyanin, phycoerythrin, Cyanobacteria, Rhodophyta<br>
The "blue-green algae", now called "Cyanobacteria", are prokaryotic and a form of bacteria that contains chlorophyll and so photosynthetic.<br>
Cyanobacteria are grey-green, violet, brown, purplish or red, and contain phycocyanin, phycoerythrin.<br>
They occur as single cells, colonies and more complex structures.<br>
They have no membrane-bound organelles in the cells, so they have no nucleus defined by a membrane, no dispersed photosynthetic pigments, no chloroplasts.<br>
Sexual reproduction and motile cells have not yet been observed.<br>
Similar to the Cyanobacteria are marine and freshwater phytoplankton that cause algal blooms, e.g. Synechoccus, Prochloron, Pochlorococcus.<br>
Blue Green algae genera: Anabaena, Gloeotrichia, Microcystis. Nostoc, Oscillatoria, Spirulina<br>
<a name="NostocspH"><br>
<a name="SpirulinaspH"><br>
<br>
Mastigocladus laminosus, is a thermophilic cyanobacterium that lives in hot springs.<br>
<br>
Nostoc</a>, (Nostoc commune), cyanobacterium, can fix atmospheric nitrogen, lives in leaf cavities of the Hornworts. Anthocerotophyta.<br> Division, and in the roots of Cycas species</a><br>
Nostoc, star jelly, star shot, star slime, witch’s butter, witch’s jelly, is a dark blue-green, jelly-like organism found in damp grass.<br>
It dries to form a black shrivelled crust.<br>
It produces green chlorophyll for photosynthesis and a blue pigment phycocyanin, C13H10N2O, for photosynthesis under low light conditions and is the origin of the name cyanobacteria, “blue-green” bacteria.<br>
Nostoc can fix only a small amount of nitrogen compared to fixation by legumes. but it is useful in paddy production of rice.<br>
<br>
Spirulina is a mixture of Arthrospira platensis, (Spirulina platensis) + Arthrospira maxima (Spirulina maxima), edible nutritious algae used as a food and in health drinks.<br>
Spirulina maxima and Spirulina platensis, are nitrogen-fixing and live in leaf cavities of floating ferns, China, Family Phormidiaceae.<br>
The dried herb is sold as spirulina powder.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.5H">9.5</a> Heterokontophyta<br>
Heterokontophytes is a group of algae, also known as ochrophytes or stramenochromes.<br> 
As of 2024, ochrophytes amount to 23,314 described species, of which the majority are diatoms.<br> 
They are the photosynthetic organisms with a cell nucleus, characterized by the presence of two unequal flagella.<br>
They can be single-celled, colonial, coenocytic or multicellular.<br> 
All ochrophytes have folds in the mitochondria to increase thr area for cellular respiration.<br>
They are algae, distinguished from other groups of algae by their flagella, chloroplasts and pigments.<br>
They are mostly photosynthetic, but some groups have lost photosynthetic capacity and pigments.<br> 
Ochrophyte chloroplasts contain chlorophylls a and c as photosynthetic pigments, in addition to fucoxanthin.<br>
Ochrophyte algae accumulate | Leucasin, C42H70O12 | as a storage product, but they lack starch.<br>
Ochrophytes are present in nearly all environments, including marine habitats, freshwater or soil.<br> 
Ochrophytes include brown algae (Phaeophyceae), golden algae (Chrysophyceae), e.g.  Hydrurus, and yellow-green algae (Xanthophyceae), e.g. Vaucheria, Tribonema and Bumilleria.<br>
Some diatoms, e.g. Cocconeis, grow  attached to the substrate through adhesive films, but Eunotia and Nitzschia grow stalks or colonial tubes.<br> 
Uunicellular algae Heterosigma and Chattonella, Raphidophyceae, cause  fish mortality.<br>
Gonyostomum mucilage damages fish gills and causes algal blooms.<br> 
The diatom Chaetoceros clog fish gills, and Pseudonitzschia produces a neurotoxin to cause shellfish poisoning.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.6H">9.6</a> Lichens, Ascomycota<br>
A lichen is symbiotic relationship between an algae or cyanobacteria and a fungus, within the body of a fungus.<br>
A symbiosis is the partnership between two species for the benefit of each.<br>
 The photosynthetic algae partner in the lichen thallus is called a photobiont.<br>
 Many lichen species contain, algae genus Trebouxia, which can also live independently in marine, freshwater and terrestrial environments.<br>
 Each type of lichen has a characteristic shape.<br>
 The fungi in a lichen are mainly Ascomycetes.<br>
 Lichens may be nitrogen-fixing.<br>
 Lichens are found in most places in the world and are very susceptible to air pollution in the atmosphere.<br>
 They may be damaged by sulfur dioxide or other harmful gases, and may die.<br>
 So lichens are sensitive plant detectors of air pollution.<br>
 1. Crustose lichens form a flattened thin crust on rocks, soil and tree bark.<br>
 These encrusting forms spread over and into the surface of their habitat.<br>
 They crumble if removed from the surface.<br>
 2. Foliose lichens are like leaves on rocks and tree bark, sometimes with a paper texture.<br>
 The leafy lobes spread out over the surface.<br>
 They can be easily removed with a knife, because they are attached to the surface by root-like threads.<br>
 3. Fructicose lichens have upright stalks with many thread-like branches, sometimes with fruiting structures at the ends.<br>
 They have shrubby forms with many branches.<br>
 They can be removed from the surface by hand.<br>
 4. Squamulose lichens have a primary and secondary loosely-attached thallus.<br>
Lung lichen, (Lobaria pulmonaria), lungwort, is a nitrogen-fixing lichen<br>

<a name="CetrariaspH">Iceland moss</a> (Cetraria islandica), Parmeliaceae<br>
 Cetraria islandica, island cetraria lichen ("Iceland moss") is a lichen growing abundantly in the mountainous regions of Europe, usually lava slopes, USA<br>
 It is easily digested, has a bitter taste, and is used medicinally as a folk medicine.<br>
 <a href="https://www.herbcottage.com.au/dried-iceland-moss.html">Dried herb</a> sold as aerials flakes.<br>
Experiments<br>
1. Examine a specimen of a common lichen.<br>
 Study a prepared slide showing a transverse section of the thallus revealing the presence of alga and fungus.<br>
 Look for the penetrating haustoria.<br>
 2. Attach 10 lichens on a board.<br>
 Then put them in three places, e.g. near a factory, in the central city and far from the factory.<br>
 Observe any change in the lichens after one mouth.<br>
 Count the percentage of damaged lichens.<br>
 Lichens indicators are used as indicators of air pollution and species diversity.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.7H">9.7</a> Kingdom Protista, protists<br>
A protista has such simple cellular organism that it is not classified as a plant, animal or fungus.<br>
Most protista are unicellular, (although some multicellular algae, e.g. kelps - seaweeds, are without specialized tissues), and live in water or water soil 
or are parasitic.<br>
All protista have a nucleus, so are eukaryotic.<br>
Protista may be heterotrophic or autotrophic, i.e. chemotrophic or phototrophic.<br>

 Protozoa are single-celled (unicellular), but may be colonial if no division of functions.<br>
 Gas exchange and excretion is by diffusion.<br>
 Osmoregulation in freshwater forms is by a contractile vacuole.<br>
 Asexual reproduction is by binary fission and sometimes sexual reproduction by conjugation occurs.<br>

Classification of Coelenterata<br>
(Modern taxonomists use the following phyla instead of Phylum Coelenterata: Phylum Ctenophora, comb jellies, Phylum Cnidaria, jellyfish, sea anemones)<br>
Phylum Coelenterata, (Greek koilos hollow, énteron, intestine), are mostly marine colonial organisms, with two cell layers, ectoderm and endoderm, separated by jelly-like mesogloea, have radial symmetry, hollow cup-like body (enteron cavity), with only one entrance, tentacles around the mouth, independent stinging cells not connected to the network nervous system.<br>
Coelenterata have two body forms:<br>
The hydroid form is a sedentary polyp.<br>
The medusa form is a plankton jellyfish-like organism.<br>
1. Class Hydrozoa, have polyp and medusa forms in the life cycle Order Hydrida<br>
e.g. Hydra, is one of the few freshwater species<br>
<a href="../images/9.37.4.gif">See diagram 9.37.4</a> Hydra.<br>
Obelia forms a colony of hollow tubes attached to seaweed with polyp heads, hydranths, specialized either for feeding or for reproducing by medusa buds.<br>
<a href="../images/9.37.7.gif">See diagram 9.37.7</a> Obelia.<br>

<a href="../images/9.37.6.gif">See diagram 9.37.6</a> Physalia, "Portuguese man-of-war".<br>
In Australia, it is commonly called a "bluebottle", where the dactylozoids detach in the water off the surfing beaches and surfers are stung by the nematocysts.<br>
2. Class Scyphozoa, jellyfish, medusa form is the main stage in the life cycle, e.g. Aurelia<br>
<a href="../images/9.37.5.gif">See diagram 9.37.5</a> Aurelia jellyfish.<br>

Classification of Platyhelminthes<br>
Many Platyhelminthes are parasites of humans and other animals.<br>
To control these parasites, their life cycle can be broken by killing the hosts or parasites in the host, thoroughly cooking food that contain parasites, and sanitary disposal of human and animal wastes.<br>
Make sure that children wash their hands thoroughly after handling cats and dogs.<br>
Platyhelminthes have a dorsiventrally-flattened body (flattened from above), bilateral symmetry (head, tail, left and right sides), three cell layers: (ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm), but no body cavity.<br>
Both sex organs are present in the one organism (hermaphrodite).<br>
They have a primitive brain and paired ventral nerve cords.<br>
The three classes of platyhelminthes are as follows:<br>
1. Class Turbellaria, planarians, are free-living flatworms with simple anterior eyes and can replace lost body parts (regeneration).<br>
They move with cilia and rhythmical muscle contraction to scavenge detritus.<br>
2. Class Trematoda, flukes, have a complex attaching devices of suckers and sometimes hooks.<br>
They attach themselves to the interior of the host and suck in blood and mucus with a muscular pharynx.<br>
Cat liver fluke (Opisthorchiasis felineus)<br>
Chinese liver fluke (Clonorchis sinensis)<br>
Lung fluke (Paragonimus westermani)<br>
Schistosoma fluke (Schistosoma mansoni, S. japonicum), bilharzia, schistosomiasis disease, infection by skin penetration, parasite in freshwater snails<br>
Sheep liver fluke (Fasciola hepatica)<br>
<a href="../images/9.37.1.gif">See diagram 9.37.1</a>: Fasciola hepatica.<br>
3. Class Cestoda, tapeworms, attach to the gut wall of host by an attaching device (scolex) with hooks and suckers.<br>
The body is divided into segments (proglottids) that are continually produced behind the scolex.<br>
They remain attached to the interior of the hosts digestive system and absorb the pre digested food.<br>

<a href="../images/9.38.1.gif">See diagram 9.38.1</a>: Amoeba<br>
Amoeba proteus is a single cell, aquatic, organism that is constantly changing shape.<br>
The cytoplasm consists of clear jelly-like ectoplasm and granular endoplasm.<br>
A clear rounded area, contractile vacuole, expands and contracts as it collects and expels water to maintain the concentration of the cytoplasm.<br>
A central nucleus controls all the activities.<br>
It moves by forming a pseudopodium (false foot), by the endoplasm flowing into the ectoplasm.<br>
The amoeba flows into the pseudopodium which may be anchored to the substrate by the outer membrane, pellicle or plasma lemma, becoming sticky.<br>
Amoeba feeds on small organisms by flowing around them and enclosing them in a food vacuole, where they are digested.<br>
Reproduction is by simple binary fission, when the amoeba splits into two.<br>
Amoeba avoids dry conditions by forming a spore with an external cyst wall.<br>
Entamoeba species have no contractile vacuole possibly, because the live as parasites in vertebrates.<br>
They have only one or two large blunt pseudopodia.<br>

Infection occurs after ingestion of cysts in fecally-contaminated food or water.<br>
In the small intestine, the cysts break open to release sporozoan trophozoites, which migrate to the large intestine, absorb nutrients, grow and multiply  to form cysts.<br>

This breakthrough could support the suppression and potential eradication of Aedes aegypti worldwide.<br>
Published today in PNAS, the landmark trial involved releasing three million male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in Northern Queensland, sterilised with bacteria called Wolbachia, across three trial sites over a 20-week period during the summer of 2018.<br>
The sterile male insects search out and mate with wild females, preventing the production of offspring.<br>
Scientists returned the following year and found one of the trial sites, Mourilyan in Queensland, was almost devoid of mosquitoes.<br>
CSIRO scientist and UQ Associate Professor, Nigel Beebe, said the trial demonstrates this technique is capable of effectively suppressing mosquito populations.<br>
“During the trial, we saw over 80 per cent of the mosquito population suppressed across our three trial sites.<br>
When we surveyed the sites the following year, we were very encouraged to see the suppression still in effect, with one of our most productive towns for Aedes aegypti almost devoid of this mosquito with a 97 per cent reduction across the following season.<br>
One year on, the mosquito population at the second trial site remained substantially suppressed, while the population fully recovered at the third site.<br>
We are currently investigating the differences observed in the following mosquito season as they are incredibly informative in further developing this technology and in modelling how we could remove this exotic virus-transmitting pest in other locations worldwide.”<br>
The technique can also be used to remove the virus-transmitting Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, that has now established at Australia’s doorstep in the Torres Strait Islands.<br>

The Coniferophyta, or Pinophyta, or Coniferae, commonly known as conifers, are vascular land plants containing a single class, Pinopsida.<br>
Conifers are cone-bearing seed plants, a subset of gymnosperms, perennial woody plants with secondary growth.<br>
Conifers include the pine, fir, spruce, other cone-bearing trees and shrubs, and yews<br>
Coniferophyta, Pinophyta, conifers are seed-bearing plants with ovules on the edge of an open sporophyll.<br>
The sporophylls are arranged in cone-like structures.<br>
<br>
Conifers are pyramidal or conical trees with long straight stems that taper to an apical growing point, the leader.<br>
The almost horizontal branches bear narrow needle-shaped leaves.<br>
The original tap root dies leaving shallow roots that let the tree be blown over by storms.<br>
Smaller roots have no root hairs, but have a sheath of fungus that penetrates into the root epidermis.<br>
Small microspore cones at the ends of branches produce microspores, pollen grains.<br>
Large megaspore cones are made up of leaf-like sporophylls that contain the ova.<br>
The fertilized ova develop to form seeds released when the woody cone opens.<br>
Most conifers produce woody cones by lignification of the seed-bearing sporophylls, but Juniperus, Podocarpus and Taxus have soft fruit.<br>
<a href="../images/9.50.gif">See diagram 9.50</a>: Pine tree cone.<br>
<a href="../images/9.50.1.gif">See diagram 9.50.1</a>: Swelling movements.<br>
<br>
Experiments<br>
1. Look for a microspore cone, pollen grain, pollen tube, microsporophyll, microspores (pollen) megasporophyll, micropyle, ovule, megaspore, and bract.<br>
2. Examine twigs of Pinus in summer.<br>
The twigs should show evidence of at least three years' growth.<br>
Observe the structure of purely vegetative twigs, the position and structure of seed cones of varying age, the position and structure of staminate cones.<br>
3. Examine the male and female cones of Pinus.<br>
Dig up some shallow roots and examine the mycorrhiza under the microscope.<br>
Dissect first year, second year and third year seed cones and note their general structure.<br>
Note the seeds lying naked on the cone scales.<br>
4. Remove a megasporophyll from a first year cone and look for the two megasporangia (ovules) on the upper surface.<br>
The bract scale is on the lower surface.<br>
5. Examine the structure in longitudinal section under high power.<br>
6. Examine a sporophyll from a second year cone in the same way.<br>
7. Examine a third year cone.<br>
Remove a megasporophyll and note the seeds with their wings attached.<br>
Cut a longitudinal section through a seed and examine under low power.<br>
8. Dissect a staminate cone and note the form of the microsporophylls (stamens).<br>
Crush one of them into a drop of glycerine and examine the pollen grains under high power.<br>
Examine transverse and longitudinal sections of staminate cones.<br>
9. Examine the structure of the current year stem and the older stems by means of transverse and longitudinal sections.<br>
Examine the tracheids, the sieve tubes, the medullary rays and the resin canals.<br>
10. Cut a transverse section of a leaf.<br>
<br>
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.11.1H">9.11.1</a> Marchantiophyta Experiments<br>
 1. Collect plants from moist sheltered places, e.g. behind waterfalls, in cooler periods of the year.<br>
 2. Collect plants of Pellia in the early spring.<br>
 Observe the leafy gametophyte with rhizoids at its base and the capsule or sporogonium.<br>
 Note the presence of dark green globular capsules just behind the growing points of some thallus branches.<br>
 Also, note small warty prominences further back from the tip and either side of the midrib.<br>
 These prominences are old antheridia cavities, now empty.<br>
 Dissect out a sporogonium, noting the short seta.<br>
 Crush the capsule into a drop of water.<br>
 Observe the wall with its characteristic thickenings, the spores and the elaters.<br>
 Cut a transverse section of the thallus, mount in water and note the structure, similar to the lamina of Fucus, but attached to the soil, with hair-like rhizoids.<br>
<br>
 3. Collect Pellia plants in the early summer.<br>
 Observe the presence of antheridia and cut sections through the thallus where they occur.<br>
 Note also involucres just behind the tips of some branches and cut longitudinal sections through these to see the archegonia.<br>
 Look for the thallus, gemma cups, rhizoids, sperm with two flagella, male thallus, antheridium, female thallus, and archegonium.<br>
 Liverworts are the most lowly land plants with single-celled rhizoids and no clearly-differentiated stem and leaves.<br>
 They grow in moist shady habitats on wet rocks or near shallow streams, usually clumped together to save moisture.<br>
 The plant is the gametophyte generation, a broad branching thallus.<br>
 Together the plants look like little leaves clumped together and attached to the damp soil by hair-like rhizoids.<br>
 The antheridia produce swimming sperm that fertilize an ovum in the archegonium to form the zygote that grows into the sporophyte.<br>
 The sporophyte has no chlorophyll and remains a sort of parasite with no connection to the soil, but attached to the archegonium.<br>
 It releases spores that develop into the next gametophyte generation.<br>
 Marchantia reproduces rapidly by vegetative buds produced in gemma cups.<br>
 The sexual organs, the antheridia and archegonia are formed on different plants.<br>
 Collect plants from moist sheltered places, e.g. behind waterfalls, in cooler periods of the year.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2">Moss<br>
<a href="https://www.anbg.gov.au/abrs/Mosses_online/">Mosses online</a>, Australia<br>
Common cord-moss, (Funaria hygrometrica), little goldilocks, golden maidenhair moss, bonfire moss, up to 3 cm, obovate leaves form a bulb-like cluster at the top of the  long stem, male and female organs on the same plant, red-brown sporophyte is a long twisting seta with an asymmetrical grooved capsule at the tip so easy to find and identify, grows in wet soil, damp rock crevices, disturbed ground, very common in plant nurseries, widely distributed
<a href="../images/9.47.1.gif">See diagram 9.47.1</a>: Funaria, sporogonium.<br>
Juniper haircap moss, (Polytrichum juniperinum), juniper polytrichum moss, evergreen perennial, red stems, grey-green leaves with red-brown tip, dioecious, grow in thin interwoven mats, capsule of sporophyte has long hanging hairs so "haircap moss", system of tiny tubes for carrying water from the rhizoids to leaves, widely distributed, but not usually in moist or wet environments

<a href="../images/9.47.2.gif">See diagram 9.47.2</a>: Moss life cycle.<br>
 Mosses have an upright or creeping gametophyte with leaves arranges spirally.<br>
 The sporophyte has a tough seta that persists after spore dispersal.<br>
 In open country, moss grows mostly on the north side of trees in the Northern Hemisphere and on the south side of trees in the Southern Hemisphere.<br>
 Mosses grow 1-10 cm tall in clumps or mats in shady or damp locations.<br>
<br>
 Some grow on trees, fences and walls.<br>
 Mosses have multicellular rhizoids and distinct stems and leaves.<br>
 Mosses have an upright or creeping gametophyte with leaves arranged spirally.<br>
 If the sex organs are developed on different plants, as with Dawsonia, the antheridia are attached to a cup-like receptacle at the apex of the male plant.<br>
 The antheridia burst to release sperm that use their two cilia to swim in rain water to the archegonia at the apex of the female plants and fertilize the ova.<br>
 The zygote grows vertically into the sporophyte that remains attached to the female plant and consists of a long stalk, seta and a capsule containing the sporogonium.<br>
 The mature capsule will release very light spores to be dispersed by the wind and grow into the next gametophyte generation.<br>
<br>
 Moss experiments<br>
 1. Examine capsules of Funaria or other mosses at different stages of maturity and note the peristome and the method of liberation of spores.<br>
 If you fix a cut off capsule in wax, you can examine the peristome under low power.<br>
 Breath on the capsule to show the hygroscopic movements of the peristome teeth.<br>
<br>
 2. Collect protonema of Polytrichum from hedgerows or on the soil in flower pots.<br>
 Polytrichum spores germinate to form a filamentous stage called a protonema.<br>
 Later, buds form on the protonema to grow into the moss plant.<br>
 Polytrichum often mingles with Vaucheria, but Polytrichum is septate.<br>
 Observe the green filaments with transverse septa and the brownish rhizoids with oblique septa.<br>
 Observe buds on the green filaments and young plants in various stages of development.<br>
<br>
 3. Look for the male and female plant, female plant with attached sporogonium, leaves, stem, rhizoids, sporogonium capsule, sporogonium seta.<br>
 4. Collect common woodland mosses usually found in compact colonies or cushions in damp shady places.<br>
 Some grow on the damper side or south side of tree trunks and fence posts.<br>
 Observe the erect stems, small leaves, and the rhizoids that attach the plant to the soil.<br>
 Look for terminal cups, sexual organs, and tubular capsules that contain asexual spores.<br>
 Some tufts of plants bear rosette-like antheridia cups containing spores.<br>
 Dissect out the contents of one of these into water and note the structure of the antheridia and paraphyses, sterile hairs or filaments that bear the spore-making structures, the sporangia.<br>
 The archegonia cups that house the ovum are less conspicuous, so you may have to dissect more than one apex to find an archegonium.<br>
<br>
 5. Use four areas of activity: 1. field observations, 2. spore culture, 3. cultivation of gametophytes, 4. investigation of spore and leafy gametophyte growth to 
 study the times of spore discharge, growth of the protonema, leafy gametophyte production, sex organ production (archegonia and<br>antheridia), 
 fertilization, growth of sporophyte, relative importance of reproduction by spores or gemmae and tubers.<br>
 You will need information on local temperatures, day length, rainfall, to relate to observations of life cycles.<br>
 6. The upper part of the moss capsule (sporangium) may be specialized for gradual spore discharge.<br>
 The life cycle of moss begins with asexual reproduction.<br>
 Leaf-like moss grow thin, brown stalk with capsules at the top.<br>
 The capsules contain tiny spores instead of sex cells.<br>
 Spores are the cells that can develop into a new individual without fertilization.<br>
 Mosses reproduce by means of spores (small blue spheres) which are dispersed from the mouth of the capsule by the numerous rays (orange and brown), that snap open.<br>
 Grow moss spores can be grown under sterile conditions, e.g. Funaria hygrometrica, Clubmoss, and study which factors of the environment controls germination, growth, differentiation of leafy gametophytes.<br>
Mature spore filled capsules are mostly available in the latter half of the year in the Southern Hemisphere, but if collected in February, March it may be hard to sterilize.<br>
A problem is how to count the numbers of spores per capsule, per culture, or the number of leafy gametophytes that form.<br>
Leafy gametophytes grow from the protonema.<br>

1. Look for the Selaginella plant, cone, scale leaves, lateral leaves, rhizophores.<br>
Observe the microsporangia containing many microspores, and megasporangium containing four megaspores.<br>
 The Clubmoss have club-shaped cones that bear spores and are known as "fern allies".<br>
 Plants of the Selaginella genus, spikemoss, are small prostrate plants with four rows of small leaves on the axis.<br>
 They live in damp places.<br>
 Selaginella kraussiana and Selaginella martensii are grown in greenhouses.<br>
 The Selaginella plant is a sporophyte bearing microsporangia and megasporangia in the same cone.<br>
 A microsporangium produces microspores to be dropped onto damp soil and later eject a swimming sperm.<br>
 The larger megasporangium produces megaspores to be dropped onto the soil, germinate in rainy weather, and produce a female prothallus with an ovum inside.<br>
 The ovum is fertilized by the sperm to form a zygote that grows into the next sporophyte generation.<br>
 Both types of spores have a tri-radiate ridge from origin in the tetrads following meiosis.<br>
<br>
 Experiments<br>
 1. Collect the microspores and megaspores from a ripe cone and scatter the spores on moist absorbent paper.<br>

It is an insignificant little plant like a little flat leaf, the size of a fingernail.<br>
Experiments<br>
 1. Examine Dryopteris, wood fern.<br>
 Note the rhizome and adventitious roots, stem and compound leaves, fronds.<br>
 Note the sori (singular: sorus) under the recurved fronds where spores are formed.<br>
 Dryopteris has rounded sori.<br>
 Pteridium has long sori along the margins of the pinnules.<br>
 Look for the sori under a leaf, compound leaf or frond, coiled young leaf, rhizome, and roots.<br>
 2. Cut a transverse section of a pinnule of Dryopteris to pass through a sorus.<br>
 Observe the tissues of the leaf, the placenta, sporangia in various stages of development in the indusium.<br>
 3. Dehiscence of fern sporangia Pteridium<br>
 Scrape some ripe sporangia into a drop of glycerine on a slide.<br>
 The glycerine withdraws water from the annulus cells and thus causes the opening of the sporangia.<br>
 You can slow the movements of the annulus with glycerine.<br>
 Scrape other sporangia on to a warm slide and observe the annulus movements under the microscope.<br>
 4. Fern prothallus Pteridium<br>
 To grow fern prothalli, place a soaked flower pot inside a larger one, packing the space between with wet sphagnum or peat.<br>
 Allow a mature frond bearing a sorus to dry on a piece of paper and then scatter the spores so obtained on the inner surface of the small flower pot.<br>
 Stand the pots in an inch or so of water and cover the top of the pots with a sheet of glass.<br>
 Green prothalli will soon appear, and you can observe successive stages in their development.<br>
 Observe the archegonia and the liberation of sperms from the antheridia.<br>
 Young sporophytes will develop if you water the prothalli after they show archegonia.<br>
