Desert pussy paws, (Cistanthe ambigua), annual low herb, spoon-shaped thick leaves along the stem, Mexico and US deserts, Montiaceae<br>
<br>
Crimson spot rockrose, (Cistus ladanifer),  Mediterranean region, Cistaceae<br>
Mediterranean people used rake-like combs on goats browsing on rock rose plants, Cistus ladanifer and Cistus creticus.<br>
The collected leaves and twigs were sold on to people who knew how to distil a sticky brown resin called labdanum, hence the specific name "ladanifer".<br>
The labdanum was used as a folk remedy to treat colds, coughs, and menstrual problems.<br>
Labdanam is still used in perfumes and health care products, and even in vermouth.<br>
It is used in perfumes instead of ambergris from the sperm whale, and so "Save the whales"!<br>
Labdanam may be mentioned in the Bible (Genesis 37:25 and 43:11) as ("lot" = resin) and in the Jewish Torah (Exodus 30: 34).<br>
Labdanum's delightful odour has been described in so many ways and it had a smell loved by the ancient Egyptians.<br>
The god Osiris was usually shown with a false beard, called a postiche, attached below the chin with a string.<br>
Also, Osiris carried a shepherd's crook and a flail, the so called "sceptre of Osiris", a symbol of sovereignty.<br>
The pharaohs of ancient Egypt thought this was good idea, so they always appeared wearing a false beard, just like the god Osiris.<br> 
Early false beards were made of metal, but later versions contained hair-like substances and only the pharaohs were allowed to wear them.<br> 
Ancient Egyptians thought that hair was dirty, so you have never seen a picture or statue of  a hairy pharaoh.<br> 
The hirsute poor could not afford a full body haircut.<br> 
A false beard worn below the chin was OK, because you could put it on with string or take it off.<br> 
The early false beards were made of metals, but later false beards contained hair-like particles.<br>  
The later false beards contained crushed Cistus plants, giving off their delightful odour, so that the pharaohs had an Osiris-like radiance - the same Cistus plants gathered with the "sceptre of Osiris"!<br>
