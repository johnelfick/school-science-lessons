Datura species are called angel's trumpets, as are other Solanaceae species.<br>
22/12/2022: Australian broadcasting Corporation, "Thornapple", (edited for this website)<br>
About 200 Australians have been reported being poisoned this week as a result of eating contaminated spinach.<br>
The contamination was traced back to the noxious weed thornapple, also known as jimsonweed, a poisonous invasive species that is found across Australia.<br>
<br>
Thornapple, (Datura stramonium), jimsonweed, devil's snare, devil's trumpet, Solanaceae, a family of plants, which includes both highly toxic plants such as nightshade and belladonna and kitchen staples like tomatoes and potatoes.<br>
It is a leafy annual herb, grows to 60 cm in height, oval or broadly triangular-shaped flowers with jagged edges, white flowers, from Central America, was introduced in Australia as a garden plant and once used as a treatment for mania and epilepsy.<br>
Every part of the thornapple plant is toxic to both humans and animals.<br>
Children in particular are very sensitive to thornapple poisoning, with common symptoms including: thirst dilated pupils, high temperatures, weak or rapid pulse, incoherence or hallucinations, vomiting, breathing problems, convulsions.<br>
Touching the plant can also cause dermatitis, nausea and headaches in some people.
Every part of the thornapple plant is poisonous, with the seeds particularly high in toxins.<br>
In agricultural lands it competes with summer crops and spreads by seed,<br>
A spinach producer has confirmed that thornapple had been found in its "baby spinach" products.<br>
Thornapple in gardens can be removed physically with hand weeding, or chemically with herbicide.<br>

Delphinium<br>
The more than 365 species of genus Delphinium, larkspurs, occur mainly in the cool and moist conditions of the northern temperate regions of Asia, Europe, and North America.<br>
They have long been cultivated for their coloured flowers, yellow dye for silk, and as herbal pesticides against lice, larvae of mosquito, and flies.<br>
The tubers and roots, have been extensively used as herbal medicines, including Chinese traditional medicines, for the treatment of many kinds of diseases.<br>
Delphinium plants have been investigated to isolate anthocyanin pigments from the flowers, e,g, delphinin), diterpenoid alkaloids, flavonoids and other phenolic compounds, fatty acids, terpenoids and steroids, all isolated from Delphinium plants.<br>
Delphiniums need darkness to germinate and these plants are poisonous, so are not recommended to be planted in gardens frequented by young children.<br>
(The genera Aconitum and Consolida are also well known for their characteristic diterpenoid alkaloid components.)<br>

Pink carnations were associated with the Virgin Mary, but nowadays, carnations have a wide range of colours and certain colours have certain meanings, so ask a florist to suggest a suitable colour when buying carnations, for example, a green carnation may suggest homosexuality.<br>
