Fungi have no chlorophyll and the main body, hypha, has walls containing chitin.<br>
Fungi may be unicellular or filamentous so are generally classified as yeasts, moulds and mushrooms.<br>
Asexual spores, conidia, are cut off from the ends of conidiophore hyphae.<br>
A fungus infection of humans is called a mycosis.<br>
Fungi classification<br>
Fungi classification, Eukaryota, mycota, the "true fungi", are classified into the following 6 groups:<br>

<b>9.6.7</b> Penicillium on rotten fruit and lemon<br>
1. Leave citrus fruit, e.g. two oranges and lemons, in a bowl on the table for a week.<br>
Divide the fruit into two samples and put each sample into a plastic bag with some wet cotton wool.<br>
Tie the mouths of the bags tightly with string to make them both airtight.<br>
Put one plastic bag in box where the fruit will be warm and in the dark.<br>
Put the other plastic bag in a refrigerator.<br>
After two weeks examine the fruit.<br>
The citrus fruit in the refrigerator may appear smaller due to loss of water, but the fruit in the box may have a blue-green fur covering of fungus.<br>

<br>
2.Lemon, Penicillium<br>
Put a clean lemon cut in half in a clean colourless plastic container with a tight lid.<br>
Add drops of water.<br>
Wrap the plastic container in a sheet of plastic or aluminium foil and leave it in a dark place for one week.<br>
Look at the lemon in the plastic container without opening it.<br>
Observe the green mould of Penicillium growing on the lemon.<br>
Dispose of the container in the garbage without opening the container.<br>

<h3>9.1.1 Fungi Kingdom</h3>
Fungi (Singular: fungus), are a large group of eukaryotic organisms with over 100, 000 named species, but less than 500 can cause disease in otherwise healthy persons.<br>
They are usually saprophytes in the soil and on decomposing organic matter.<br>
Their cells are encased in a rigid cell wall composed of polysaccharides, e.g. glucan, mannan, chitin and glycoproteins.<br>
They are heterotrophic so they have no chlorophyll and feed by secreting enzymes for external digestion and absorbing nutrients through their cell walls.<br>
They have a simple structure with no division of cells into organs or tissues.<br>
The basic structural unit is either a chain of tubular, filament-like cells, called a hypha, or an independent single cell, called a yeast.<br>
Pathogenic fungi may change their growth form during tissue invasions.<br>
They usually change from a multicellular hypha form in the natural environment to a budding, single-celled yeast form in tissue.<br>
The vegetative stage consists of a mass of branching hyphae called a mycelium.<br>
Each hypha has a rigid cell wall that increases in length by of apical extension with mitotic cell division.<br>
Most hyphae are septate, partitioned by cross walls.<br>
Moulds are fungi with a microscopic multicellular mycelium.<br>
The fungi that exist as independent single cells, the yeasts, propagate by asexual budding where the cell develops a protuberance from its surface.<br>
The bud enlarges and either becomes detached as a separate cell or remains attached and produces another bud to form chain of cells.<br>
Some yeasts reproduce by fission of the cells.<br>
Moulds reproduce by means of microscopic conidia, spores.<br>
Many fungi produce conidia that result from an asexual process involving mitosis that are identical to the parent.<br>
They are short-lived and are produced in large numbers to ensure dispersion to new habitats.<br>
Many fungi are also capable of sexual reproduction involving meiosis.<br>
Some species are self-fertile and can form sexual structures within individual colonies, but most do not form their sexual structures, unless two different mating strains come into contact so meiosis then leads to the production of sexual spores.<br>
The sexual spores may be borne singly on specialized generative cells, so the whole structure is microscopic in size, but they also may be produced in millions to form fruiting bodies, e.g. mushrooms.<br>
Fungi can produce more than one type of spore, depending on the growth conditions and the species.<br>
Sexual reproduction and the accompanying structures form the basis for the classification of fungi.<br>

<h3>9.1.10 Cellulose digestion</h3>
Cellulose is a fibrous substance that helps to provide plants with a rigid structure.<br>
It is the most important plant polymer, making up some 40-50% of the mature plant cell wall.<br>
It is also the most abundant carbohydrate.<br>
The molecules are very large and long and contain carbon, hydrogen and oxygen.<br>
Cellulose is a very stable substance at ordinary temperatures, and the types of micro-organism that can decompose and thus recycle it are extremely important in sustaining the turnover of organic matter for the rest of the living world.<br>
It often occurs in a complex mixture with lignin, another plant polymer, called lignocellulose, in wood, forest and agricultural wastes, and in waste paper.<br>
Cellulose is not soluble in water, so micro-organisms cannot absorb it into their cells, but they secrete the enzyme cellulase that partly digests the cellulose to breaks it down into soluble sugar molecules, which the microbes can absorb and use.<br>
Higher organisms do not make cellulase, so herbivores cannot digest cellulose themselves.<br>
They depend on cellulolytic bacteria in their intestinal tracts to digest the cellulose for their use.<br>
On land, the major decomposers of cellulose are fungi, aided by a few aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.<br>
In marine habitats, bacteria are primarily responsible for breaking down cellulose, but in fresh water aquatic fungi carry out this function in well-aerated zones, with bacteria playing an increasingly important role as the amount of oxygen diminishes.<br>
Cellulolytic bacteria include species of Cellulomonas, Pseudomonas and Ruminococcus.<br>
Cellulolytic fungi include Chaetomium, Fusarium, Myrothecium and Trichoderma.<br>
Cellulases are used in the processing of fruit and vegetables to destroy the cell walls.<br>

<h3>9.1.11 Cork taint of wine, "corky" wine</h3>
<a href="../topics/topic16.html#16.1.3.2">See 16.1.3.2</a>: Phenols (group: OH-C in a benzene ring). (phenol = C6H5O6)<br>
The "damp cardboard" taste of corky wine is caused usually by 2,4,6-Trichloroanisole, Cl3C6H2OCH3, (2,4,6-TCA) mould produced mainly by Trichoderma and Fusarium strains of fungi when in contact with chlorine used to bleach corks made from the bark of the cork tree, Quercus suber, Fagaceae.<br>
The waiters in high class restaurants will smell the cork before first pouring the newly-opened wine to detect any unpleasant odours.<br>
The taint taste of 2,4,6-TCA may also cause the "Rio" defect in South American coffee and affect beer, sake and fish and prawns.<br>
Nowadays, the wine cork is being replaced by screw-top caps to seal wine bottles, e.g. the Stelvin capsule, "Stelvin Lux", that seals the bottle, but allows a very small amount of air to touch the surface of the wine to allow maturation.<br>
Although the screw-top capsule prevents "corkiness", the taste of the wine may still be affected by excess exposure to the air if the cork is loose.<br>
Excessive oxidation of wine may cause unpleasant odour and bad tastes, so corked wines are usually stored horizontally to keep the cork moist and prevent cork shrinkage.<br>
<br>
<a name="BrandyH"></a>
<b>Brandy</b><br>
However, fortified wines, e.g. sherry and port, have brandy, a strong spirit distilled from wine, added before fermentation is complete, leaving some residual sugar in the wine, because the remaining yeast is killed by the extra alcohol from the added brandy.<br>
The alcohol content may rise from 10 -13% in wine to 16-20% in port.<br>
However, Madeira fortified wine is said to taste better if it is slightly oxidized, so it traditionally stored upright to avoid any corky taste, yet allow some oxidation.<br>

<h3>9.1.12 Disinfectants, antiseptics and antibiotics</h3>
Antimicrobial substances include disinfectants, antiseptics and antibiotics.<br>
Disinfection is a procedure that destroys or inactivates micro-organisms.<br>
It usually involves the treatment of non-living objects such as surfaces or liquids with chemicals (disinfectants) e.g. chlorine, phenols and hypochlorites.<br>
Antisepsis is the disinfection of living tissues with chemicals (antiseptics) e.g. hydrogen peroxide, iodine and diluted alcohol.<br>
Antibiotics are chemicals that, inhibit or kill certain micro-organisms even at very low concentrations.<br>
Penicillins are a well-known group of antibiotics.<br>
Disinfectants and antiseptics that kill bacteria are said to be bactericidal.<br>
Others merely halt the growth of bacteria and if inactivated, e.g. by dilution, bacterial growth may be resumed.<br>
These substances are said to be bacteriostatic.<br>
So a bactericidal disinfectant or antiseptic may become bacteriostatic when diluted.<br>
<br>
<a name="CreolinH"></a>
<b>Creolin</b>, disinfectant, insecticide, miticide, contains: coal tars, isopropyl alcohol, phenol, sodium hydroxide.<br>
Antibiotics are produced by microbes as a natural defence against other microbes.<br>
Some are still produced using microorganisms, although a large number are manufactured chemically.<br>
Some antibiotics are active against a narrow range of species whilst others affect a broad spectrum of organisms.<br>
The ability to make antimicrobial substances is not limited to microbes.<br>
Most animals have antibacterial substances in their bodily secretions, e.g. lysosyme in sweat and tears.<br>
Plant materials such as garlic (Allium sativum), and oil of clove(Syzygium aromaticum), also have antimicrobial properties.<br>

<h3>9.1.19 Tuber melanosporum, black truffles</h3>
Black truffle, Périgord truffle, French black truffle, has a wart-like brown epidermis with red reflections.<br>
The tuber is marbled with white on anthracite base colour, has aroma of forest undergrowth and damp earth with roasted dry fruits.<br>
The taste can be described as finely peppered and long in the mouth.<br>
The Perigord is the finest grade of black truffle.<br>
The French Black Truffle is the fruiting body of the fungus (Tuber Melanosporum) that forms a symbiotic relationship with the roots of oak or hazel trees on which it grows.<br>
The edible portion, called the truffle, is harvested in winter once it has matured and is emitting a sweet perfume.<br>
The truffles are found from just below the soil surface to a depth of 20 cm by specially trained dogs or pigs, spaniels in Australia.<br>
A French black truffle, 2 cm diameter to grapefruit size, is covered in small black corrugations like the texture to a dog's nose.<br>
It has a shelf life off approximately three weeks after harvesting before it loses its distinctive taste and aroma.<br>
It forms in Spring in Australia between December to February.<br>
At first it has the form of a tiny cup shape, of which the edges will close up and form the truffle.<br>
The interior of the truffle will grow tiny veins, it is white internally and the skin is a reddish colour with small warts on the outer layer.<br>
As the truffle matures in June/September it changes to black inside with white veins, then it emits its powerful aroma.<br>
The fungi requires a warm moist period in early spring to trigger initiation of the fruiting body.<br>
Over the past 10 years, Australian prices have varied from $2000 per kg down to around $1200 per kg for first grade truffles.<br>
The trufferies are situated near Deloraine, Tasmania, Australia, and are quarantine areas with strict control over visitors enforced to ensure that any potential competing fungi are not introduced.<br>
If fresh eggs are stored with truffles for a few days, the yolks will become infused with truffle aroma.<br>

<h3><a name="9.1.21H">9.1.21/a> Slide culture preparation to identify fungi</h3>
<a href="../images/9.208.gif">See diagram 9.208</a>: Simple agar block<br>
1. To identify many fungi you must observe the conidiophores, i.e. the specialized hyphae where asexual spores cut off at the ends, and the way in which spores are produced.<br>
This method allows you to study fungi with little disturbance.<br>
Use one agar plate of nutrient agar, e.g. potato dextrose agar.<br>
2. Use a sterile blade to cut out an agar block, 7 × 7 mm, small enough to fit under a coverslip.<br>
3. Flip the agar block up onto the surface of the agar plate.<br>
Inoculate the four sides of the agar block with spores or mycelia fragments of the fungus to be grown.<br>
4. Place a flamed coverslip centrally upon the agar block.<br>
Incubate the plate at 26oC until growth and spore-forming have occurred.<br>
Remove the coverslip from the agar block.<br>
5. Apply a drop of 95% alcohol as a wetting agent.<br>
Gently lower the coverslip onto a small drop of lactophenol cotton blue on a clean glass slide.<br>
Leave the slide overnight to dry and later seal the edges with a coat of clear fingernail polish followed by one coat of red coloured polish.<br>

<b>9.2.3</b> Antibiotic resistance in the world<br>
According to the WHO, multi-drug resistant TB causes more than 150, 000 deaths every year to which must be added the hundreds of thousands who die around the world every year from antibiotic resistant infections.<br>
Antibiotics were once the wonder drug heralding a new phase of public health.<br>
Drug resistance has been known for decades and usually arises when antibiotic drugs knock out susceptible infections, sometimes leaving active strains behind that can multiply and become extremely resilient.<br>
In the past, this did not prove much of a problem as new antibiotics always appeared, but we are now facing is that the supply of new antibiotics has dried up.<br>
While there has been some attempt to rein in our overuse of antibiotic drugs, there really hasn't been a concentrated campaign to do the same for the use of antibiotics in our livestock and foodstuffs.<br>

<h3>9.6.6 Rhizopus nigricans, bread mould</h3>
<a href="../images/9.196.gif">See diagram 9.196</a>: Rhizopus nigricans<br>
Experiments<br>
1. Mount a small fragment of mould from old bread or decaying fruit and examine under the low power.<br>
Note the filaments that are the vegetative body of this fungus.<br>
Invert a smaller flat transparent dish in the bottom of a larger flat transparent dish.<br>
Stand a piece of bread on the small dish.<br>
Add tap water to the large dish until it is half way up the side of the small dish.<br>
Cover the larger dish with its lid and leave the assembly to stand at room temperature.<br>
Off-white, furry masses of mould (Mucoraceen and Aspergillacae) develop after a few days on the bread.<br>
Later these form grey-black or green sporophores.<br>

<br>
2.Label 4 plastic bags with zippers as bag 1, bag 2, bag 3, and bag 4, e.g. Ziploc plastic bags.<br>
Place a slice of dry white bread in bag 1 and seal.<br>
Sprinkle 20 drops of water on a slice of white bread to just make it damp, place it in bag 2 and seal.<br>
Sprinkle 20 drops of lemon juice on a slice of white bread, place it in bag 3 and seal.<br>
Rinse the eye dropper with water, then sprinkle 20 drops of sugar water on a slice of white bread, place it in the bag 4 and seal.<br>
Check the bags daily for two weeks and record your observations.<br>
Use graph paper to measure how much the mould spreads and calculate the percentage of the bread covered by the mould.<br>
Wash your hands each time after working on the experiment and be very careful not to inhale the mould spores.<br>
Note what bread mould needs to grow.<br>
Note whether all bread mould is identical.<br>
Leave the sealed plastic bag for a long time and note what happens.<br>
Do not open the plastic bags if they contain the bread mould, but keep them sealed and dispose of them in the garbage.<br>
Repeat the experiment at different temperature, in the light and dark, with different types of bread (some containing preservatives), with different amounts of liquid, with old and fresh bread, with bread and toast.<br>

<br>
3.Use 10 slices of white sliced bread from the same loaf.<br>
Use a knife to cut the slices into 10 × 10 cm squares.<br>
Leave the squares on the bench for one day.<br>
Put each square flat in a sealable sandwich bag, e.g. ziploc<br>
Leave 3 bags on the bench, but cover them with a dark cloth to exclude light.<br>
Put 3 bags in a refrigerator and 3 bags in a refrigerator freezer.<br>
Draw a 10 × 10 cm grid on clear plastic.<br>
Every 24 hours, for about 10 days, use the plastic grid to count the number of square centimetres of mould on each square of bread.<br>
Do not open the bags.<br>
When you have enough observations, discard all of the bags without opening them.<br>
Calculate the average area of mould grown for the 3 treatments, bench, refrigerator, freezer.<br>

<br>
4.Collect waste foods in a sealed glass container see the life of fungi, e.g. cut boiled potato, cut orange, bread.<br>
The fungi grow like little threads.<br>
They push the ends of the threads into to food to digest it.<br>
So they get their food like animals not like plants.<br>
If you keep the glass container sealed, you will see water appearing inside the glass for the respiration of the fungi.<br>
After a few days the fungi form usually black rounded structures, which will burst open to let out tiny spores.<br>
The spores are usually carried in the wind to the next food where they grow into a new fungus.<br>

<br>
5.Test clove oil.<br>
Soak circles of filter paper cut with hole puncher in clove oil.<br>
Seal a slice of bread in a plastic bag with a few drops of water and wait a few days until the (dark green to black) black mould forms on the bread.<br>
Shake the mouldy bread in water to form a mould solution.<br>
Place the mould solution on a nutrient agar plate and incubate for a while.<br>
Drop filter paper circles on the mould.<br>
The clove oil-impregnated filter paper square kills the mould.<br>

<h3>9.7.2 Ginger beer "plant"</h3>
Making ginger beer using yeasts, can manipulate many variables, especially those affecting enzyme activity (temperature, pH, heavy metals or other enzyme-targetting poisons, or those affecting the type of respiration occurring, i.e. aerobic or anaerobic (access to outside air or measured oxygen supply) and so getting different alcohol 
level outcomes.<br>
Ginger beer "plant" is the yeast Saccharomyces florentinus (S. pyriformis), and the bacterium Lactobacillus hilgardii (Brevibacterium vermiforme), a symbiotic colony of yeast and bacteria.<br>
Ginger beer soft drink is made from ginger powder and does not contain alcohol.<br>
Some people use baker's yeast or dried yeast to make ginger beer.<br>
If too much sugar is used in the ginger beer mixture, the extra carbon dioxide produced make cause dangerous explosions of glass bottles.<br>

If you can see nuclei in the cells, look for their presence in the buds.<br>
2. Start a culture each day for 10 days using one grain of yeast for each culture.<br>
On the tenth day sample and count all cultures with a microscope.<br>
Use a special slide for counting blood cells, but it is not essential.<br>
If the population on a given day is too large to count, dilute a sample by adding 1 mL of the sample and 9 mL of water.<br>
Multiply the count by 10 to get the actual sample size.<br>
If one dilution is not enough, further dilution may be done until it becomes easy to count the number of organisms.<br>
The 1 ml of sample and 9 ml of water.<br>
Multiply by 10 to get the actual sample size.<br>
If one dilution is not enough, make further dilutions until it becomes easy to count the number of organisms.<br>
The multiplication factor for two dilutions is 10 by 10 or 100: for three dilutions it is 10 by 10 by 10 or 1, 000.<br>
Note that each successive dilution is started from part of the previous dilution, not from the original sample.<br>
Graph the data obtained from cultures for analysis with time as the independent variable and population size is the dependent variable.<br>
4. Put about half a cup (about 100 mL) of warm water into a glass.<br>
Dissolve 1 teaspoon of sugar of the water.<br>
Then add 1 teaspoon of the dried yeast and mix it in well.<br>
Write down what it looks and smells like.<br>

2. Discuss whether these results are reliable and valid.<br>
3. Identify one factor that impacts the reliability of these results and one that impacts validity.<br>
4. Describe at least three modifications that could be made to this experiment to improve it.<br>
Justify these modifications using the results.<br>
Draw growth curves, calculate growth rate, determine carrying capacity.<br>
Some teachers say that they have had mixed success with this experiment when students use it to investigate population growth.<br>
Critical aspects are thorough sterilization of glassware, quality microscopes and effort in developing microscope skills.<br>
Also ensuring adequate 'swirling' of the flasks before sampling helps stop clumping which can complicate counting.<br>
Each year level varies in their ability to do this experiment.<br>
Taking photos for counting helps, but you often find that the cells are spread across several levels when you use the fine focus at 400X.<br>
We had starting counts of around 5-10 cells per 0.1mm square quadrat increasing to about 40 per quadrat then levelling off and declining over 72 to 96 hours.<br>
The use of more cytometer slides would improve the results, but they are not easy to find.<br>

<h3>9.9.0 Field fungi</h3>
1. If you have ever broken open some rotten wood, what did you see inside? [White threads and sometimes something growing out of the wood.]<br>
This is a fungus that is eating the wood and making it rotten.<br>
2. Collect different fungi in the field.<br>
Toadstools are like little umbrellas growing out of the ground or rotten wood.<br>
They may be poisonous and glow in the dark, e.g. Calvatia, Filoboletus.<br>
Bracket fungi are hard and grow out of the trunk of trees, e.g. Pycnosporus.<br>
Some fungi grow on cow dung, e.g. Pilobilus.<br>
Some fungi are parasites that attack living things, e.g. diseases on the human skin and ear, and diseases of cocoa and peanuts may all be caused by fungi.<br>
Yeasts are tiny fungi that cause fermentation of cocoa beans and are used to make beer.<br>
Are fungi good or bad? [Fungi that are parasites are bad, because they cause disease, all the other fungi are good.]<br>
What would happen if there were no fungi to make things rot? [Nutrients would not return to the soil and the world would be covered with dead things.]<br>

More than 200 species of mushrooms are known to produce psilocybin.<br>
The psychoactive of "magic mushrooms" may be used for treating depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.<br>
Psilocybin, psilocybine, psilocibin, is an indocybinnon-isoprene indole alkaloid, simple indole derivative, tryptamine alkaloid, a "prodrug" compound.<br>
It occurs in Psilocybe spp. mushrooms, and is converted in the human body to anxiolytic and psychoactive psilocin, C12H16N2O.<br>
It activates serotonin receptors in the CNS to mimic effects of serotonin, and resemble effects of LSD and mescaline.<br>
Psilocybin has successfully been used in clinical trials to treat depression.<br>
Psilocin is converted to Psilocybin by metabolic phosphorylation in the body.<br>
The Health (Drugs and Poisons) Regulation 1996 (Queensland), prohibits the possession and use of psilocybin, including the Australian species, <i>Psilocybe subaeruginosa</i>.<br>
