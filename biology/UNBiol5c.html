<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.1.01H">5.1.01</a> Sexually transmitted infections.<br>
"Every day, there are more than 1 million new cases of curable sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among people aged 15-49 years, according to data released today by WHO.<br>
This amounts to more than 376 million new cases annually of four infections - chlamydia, gonorrhoea, trichomoniasis, and syphilis.<br>
On average, approximately 1 in 25 people globally have at least one of these STIs, according to the latest figures, with some experiencing multiple infections at the same time.<br>
STIs are preventable through safe sexual practices, including correct and consistent condom use and sexual health education." World Health Organization<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.1.1H">5.1.1</a> Health-seeking behaviours to avoid unwanted outcomes<br>
 1. Safer sexual intercourse means avoiding sexual contact where body fluids
can pass into the body of another person.<br>
 Disease can be carried in all the body fluids, e.g. blood menstrual blood, 
 semen, vaginal fluids, breast milk, amniotic fluid, pre-ejaculate.<br>
 The safest way to prevent body fluids passing between sexual partners is
always to use a condom for all forms of sexual activity.<br>
 Condoms used with a water-based lubricant act as a barrier to prevent sexual
fluids passing from one person to another.<br>
 However, anal sexual intercourse is always dangerous.<br>
 2. Never share injecting equipment, because needles, syringes, spoons, filters, 
water and glasses may have traces of blood in them that 
 contain STIs.<br>
 Do not share personal toiletry items, e.g. toothbrushes, dental floss and
razors, because they also may have traces of blood on them that 
 contain STIs.<br>
 Always use disposable or properly sterilized needles for skin and body 
piercing or tattooing.<br>
 3. Avoid having many sexual partners.<br>
 Be true to one person.<br>
 The safest sexual choice is to have sexual intercourse with only one uninfected
person who also has no other sexual partner and does 
 not share injecting equipment.<br>
 4. Alcohol and other drugs impair judgment and can affect decisions about
sexual behaviour, so avoid sexual intercourse while under 
 the influence of alcohol or other drugs.<br>
 5. Both sexual partners should have healthy and clean bodies.<br>
 Many people use a shower with hot water and soap before sexual intercourse 
 and wash thoroughly between the legs.<br>
 6. There are many alternatives to penetrative sex that allow partners to
enjoy life together and not put the other partner at risk of STIs.<br>
 People can enjoy each other sexually by dancing, playing games, hugging, 
 massage and many kinds of fun activities without passing 
 body fluids between partners.<br>
 7. Prevent Infection and Spread of STDs<br>
 Use common sense and avoid sex with anyone who has genital sores, rashes, 
 discharge, or other symptoms.<br>
 Get tested together with any new sexual partner.<br>
 All anyone has to do is enter their zip code and you can find somewhere 
 near you to get tested.<br>
 Get tested for HIV and other commonly occurring, difficult to detect diseases.<br>
 HIV is a disease that is not commonly understood, as well as the process 
 of getting tested for HIV.<br>
 Common conditions can be asymptomatic.<br>
 Although someone may have an STD they may show no symptoms of it.<br>
 So, getting tested regularly is important in making sure to get early treatment
if one catches an STD.<br>
 If you think you have an STD:<br>
 Stop having sex.<br>
 Abstaining can be difficult if you are used to having sex on the regular, but if you think you have an STD this is the best way to prevent 
 spreading it to others.<br>
 Seek medical treatment.<br>
 Do not try and play it off if you think you have an STD.<br>
 The best way to prevent getting an STD is to be safe and cautious.<br>
 Use condoms with partners.<br>
 Using condoms may seem like common sense prevention, but in the heat of
the moment some people lose their head and forget to use 
 this common sense practice.<br>
 Make sure that your partners are aware and receiving treatment.<br>
 Do not let your emotions prevent you from being smart with your prevention 
 practices.<br>
 Make sure that your partner is taking care of themselves so that you do
not end up with an unwelcome surprise.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.1.2H">5.1.2</a> Infections, contact tracing recommended, STIs, HIV, TB<br>
 1. Contact Tracing in Context<br>
 Contact tracing is the process of identifying the relevant contacts of 
a person with an infectious disease (index patient) and ensuring 
 that they are aware of their exposure.<br>
 For sexually transmissible infections (STIs), relevant contacts include 
 those with whom the index patient has had sex during the 
 infectious period as well as babies of infected mothers.<br>
 For blood-borne infections such as HIV, hepatitis B and C, needle-sharing 
 contacts and transfusion recipients, as well as those who 
 may have been accidentally exposed to blood by other means, also need to
be traced.<br>
 For pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), contact tracing will involve domestic 
 or other close social contacts.<br>
 The term partner notification is often used interchangeably with contact 
 tracing. but by definition excludes needle-sharing contacts, 
 transfusion recipients and children born to infected women.<br>
 Some understand contact tracing as being synonymous with provider referral 
 (where a health professional carries out tracing of 
 contacts), while equating patient referral (where the patient does the 
notifying themselves) with partner notification.<br>
 In this manual, the term contact tracing is used in its broadest sense, 
 encompassing both patient and provider referral.<br>
 Aims: The general aims of contact tracing are:<br>
 1. To interrupt the ongoing transmission of infection.<br>
 2. To identify people with an infection who may benefit from treatment
 in order to minimize the likelihood of complications of infection.<br>
 3. To prevent reinfection from an untreated partner to help limit the 
prevalence of infection in the population.<br>
 Reinfection (also called superinfection) usually refers to an HIV-positive
person acquiring a second strain of virus from someone else with HIV.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.1.3H">5.1.3</a> STIs and "venereal 
disease"<br>
 Sexually transmitted diseases (STIs) are infectious diseases that spread 
 from person to person during intimate sexual contact, direct 
 body contact or contact with infected body fluids.<br>
 A person can become infected through having vaginal, oral or anal sexual 
 intercourse with an infected sexual partner.<br>
 An individual can become infected with more than one STI at the same time.<br>
 It is unlikely that STIs can be transmitted from objects unless the object 
 has fresh and wet infected body fluid on it.<br>
 Toilet seats are a very unlikely source of infection.<br>
 Formerly, STIs were called "venereal diseases (VD)".<br>
 STIs usually infect the genitals, rectum, throat, and conjunctiva of the
eye.<br>
 Several STIs spread from an initial site and produce sores in many parts 
 of the body.<br>
 People with one sexually transmitted infection are usually at high risk 
 for other diseases common in the same environment.<br>
 Many clients attending a clinic solely "for an AIDS test" are usually found
to have one or more STIs although their AIDS test is usually 
 negative.<br>
 However, the statistics on sex differences may not reflect the actual situation
because infected women often do not show any 
 symptoms and are more difficult to diagnose than men.<br>
 The fact that many infected women show no symptoms of STIs is especially 
 unfortunate since the complications can be quite serious in 
 pregnant women.<br>
 They may pass infections to the foetus during pregnancy or to the baby 
during childbirth.<br>
 Females who have an infection, such as genital Chlamydia, gonorrhoea, 
(NSGI), are at risk of inflammation of the uterus and 
 Fallopian tubes, if specific infections are not diagnosed or treated early.<br>
 Symptoms may be lower abdominal pain, a vaginal discharge, pain during 
sex, or abnormal vaginal bleeding or spotting.<br>
 One or more attacks of PID may damage the Fallopian tubes.<br>
 This damage can prevent fertilization from occurring, or if fertilization does occur, the growing fertilized egg may be unable to pass 
 along to the uterus causing the egg to implant in the Fallopian tube.<br>
 This is called an ectopic pregnancy that is very serious and requires emergency medical care.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.1.4H">5.1.4</a> Treatment of STIs (STDs)<br>
 The management of STIs involves treatment, counselling, and follow up.<br>
 The doctor or health worker should always explain the disease and its treatment
to the patient.<br>
 A person may remain infected when symptoms disappear, or may become reinfected 
 immediately after treatment, so a follow up visit is 
 important.<br>
 The infected person should not have sexual intercourse until the follow 
 up visit has confirmed the cure of the disease.<br>
 Sexual partners of people with STI infection should also seek medical examination
to avoid "ping-pong infection", i.e. passing disease 
 back and forth between two sexual partners.<br>
 People who learn they are infected with STIs can fell guilty, depressed, 
anxious or angry, so they should discuss their feelings with a 
 doctor, a counsellor or others who have the same problem.<br>
 The notifiable diseases (reportable diseases) that must be reported to 
governmental authorities by doctors may include Gonorrhoea, 
 Syphilis, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and Chlamydia trachomatis.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.2.15H">5.2.15</a> Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)<br>
Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), Chlamydia, Neisseria, Mycoplasma<br>
<a href="#5.2.15.1H">See 5.2.15.1</a>: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) contact tracing, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, 
 Mycoplasma genitalium<br>
 In some countries many people are infected with Chlamydia, but they are
unaware of the infection.<br>
 They do not see or feel anything wrong so they can unknowingly pass on
Chlamydia to their sexual partners if they are not using 
 condoms.<br>
 Chlamydia can also be passed on by oral or anal sex.<br>
 Females may have symptoms of a burning sensation when passing urine, an
unusual vaginal discharge, itch or irritation, lower 
 abdominal pain, pain during sexual intercourse, abnormal bleeding or spotting between periods.<br>
 Males may have symptoms of a clear whitish or yellow discharge from the 
 penis, burning or pain on passing urine, irritation or itching 
 around the urethra, pain in the rectum or testicles, pain with ejaculation.<br>
 Chlamydia may cause pelvic inflammatory disease, PID, in women if left
untreated.<br>
 A pregnant woman with a Chlamydia infection has an increased risk of having
a stillborn or premature baby.<br>
 Chlamydia infection can make them infertile.<br>
 Laboratory tests can identify Chlamydia and the infection is easily treated
with antibiotics.<br>
 The prescribed treatment must be completed.<br>
 Otherwise, the infection will not be cured.<br>
 The sexual partners should also get tested and treated.<br>
 Patients should not have sexual intercourse while they and the sexual partner
are taking the treatment, as they could reinfect each other.<br>
 Chlamydia may cause infertility due to salpingitis, infection and inflammation
in the Fallopian tubes.<br>
 Chlamydia infects the cervix in women, and the penile urethra in men.<br>
 According to a 2010 study by the CDC, Chlamydia is the most common STD 
among persons under the age of 25.<br>
 In Australia, the Queensland State Government reported in 2013 on the rapid
and steady increase in annual notifications of Chlamydia 
 rising 90 per cent between 2004 and 2009.<br>
 Symptoms: Pain during sex, and discharge from the penis or vagina.<br>
 Chlamydia is difficult to diagnose, because it can be carried for several 
 months without symptoms.<br>
 That incubation period has helped lead to an increased rate of infection.<br>
 Treatment: The use of antibiotics Dexacycline and Tetracycline for seven 
 days and persons with Chlamydia should abstain from having 
 sex during the course of treatment.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.2.10H">5.2.10</a> Gonorrhoea<br>
Gonorrhoea, urethral / vaginal discharge, "the clap""the clap", Neisseria gonorrhoeae<br>
<a href="#5.1.5H">See 5.1.5</a>: Gonorrhoea contact tracing, Neisseria 
gonorrhoeae<br>
 Gonorrhoea is caused by the gonococcus bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae.<br>
 People get infected by having sexual intercourse without a condom, oral 
 sex, or touching infected genitals or anus.<br>
 After infection they may have no symptoms until 2-10 days after infection.<br>
 Symptoms include a cream yellow discharge from the penis or vagina, pain 
 on intercourse, sore throat if infected in the throat, anus itch, 
 if infected in the anus.<br>
 Even if the symptoms clear up, the infection may still be there and cause 
 problems later.<br>
 Treat the disease with antibiotics.<br>
 Untreated gonorrhoea can cause the following:<br>
 1. Ulcers that increase the risk of infection by HIV, 2. Pelvic inflammatory
 disease (PID), 3. Infertility of women, 4. Infection in the 
 eyes of the baby. 5. Infertility due to salpingitis, inflammation of the Fallopian tubes.<br>
 All the sexual partners of a person infected with gonorrhoea should be 
checked by a doctor.<br>
Gonorrhoea, or "the Clap", is a bacterial STD that is very common among sexually
active teens and young adults.<br>
 Gonorrhoea is often found with Chlamydia.<br>
 There are more than 700, 000 new cases a year in the US.<br>
 Condoms are a great preventive measure.<br>
 Be aware that, because this is a bacterial infections oral transmission 
 is possible, often resulting in gonorrhoea of the throat.<br>
 Symptoms: "The Clap" is commonly recognizable by burning during urination.<br>
 For men, there is also a common penile discharge usually coloured white 
 or yellow, but can sometimes come through green discharge.<br>
 Treatment: CDC recommends that uncomplicated gonorrhoea be treated only 
 with the antibiotic ceftriaxone given as an injection and in 
 combination with either azithromycin or doxycycline both of which are oral
antibiotics.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.2.13H">5.2.13</a> Non-specific urethritis (NSU)<br>
<a href="#5.1.3H">See 5.1.3</a>: Chlamydia<br>
 Non-specific urethritis (NSU), non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU), non-specific 
 genital infection (NSGI)<br>
 Non-specific urethritis (NSU) is a common infection among young sexually 
 active people who have sexual intercourse without using 
 a condom.<br>
 Many people do not have any symptoms.<br>
 In males it is called non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) or non-specific urethritis
(NSU) or non-specific genital infection (NSGI).<br>
 Urethritis is an inflammation of the urethra.<br>
 The symptoms are a watery, white discharge from the urethra in the penis 
 or pain on passing urine.<br>
 In females, NSGI is often cervicitis, inflammation of the cervix.<br>
 The symptoms are lower abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, pain on sexual 
 intercourse or a burning sensation on passing urine.<br>
 People with these symptoms should be tested for STI infection.<br>
 The most common cause is Chlamydia trachomatis, although often the specific
 organism causing the symptoms cannot be identified.<br>
 Non-gonococcal urethritis is caused by a primitive bacterium, a mycoplasma.<br>
 Antibiotic treatment cures these infections.<br>
 Sexual partners of patients should be tested and treated whether or not 
 they appear to have symptoms.<br>
 Sexual intercourse should be avoided until the treatment is complete.<br>
 If NSGI infections are not treated without delay, there is a danger in 
 females of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) damaged Fallopian 
 tubes and infertility.<br>
 In males there is danger of prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate gland), epididymitis (inflammation of the 
 epididymis), and infertility.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.2.14H">5.2.14</a> Pediculosis<br>
Pediculosis, lice, louse, <i>Phthirus pubis</i><br>
<a href="../foodgardens/Foodgardens4.html#16.3.3H">16.3.3</a> Lindane, gammexane, BHC, 
 benzene hexachloride<br>
 Pediculosis or louse infestation is caused by the arthropod pubic louse, 
 "crabs", crab louse, <i>Phthirus pubis</i>.<br>
 The louse attaches to coarse body hair and causes irritation, redness and
 dermatitis.<br>
 Lice usually spread by close body contact, sharing combs and rarely by 
contact with unwashed bed linen or towels.<br>
 Treatment is by DDT powder or lotions or γ-benzene hexachloride to kill 
 the lice and eggs.<br>
 Pubic lice move from person to person by close contact, often during sex.<br>
 They can be infected by pubic lice from sharing soiled clothes, bed sheets, 
 or towels.<br>
 Other kinds of lice, the head louse, <i>Pediculus humanus capitus</i>, and the
body louse, <i>Pediculus humanus corporis</i>, can be quite 
 common in schools.<br>
 If infestation occurs, all the children in the school should be treated.<br>
 The eggs of lice, "nits", become attached to hairs. but may be removed with
a special fine comb, "nit comb".<br>
 Trench fever, relapsing fever, that affects soldiers confined in warfare 
 trenches, is transmitted by the faeces of lice.<br>
 Day 0 Egg laid on hair shaft, Day 6 -7 Louse hatches, Day 8-9 First moult, 
 Day 11-12 Second moult, Day 17-18 Adult lice mate and 
 female lays first eggs 1-2 days after mating<br>
 Day 19-32 Females lay 3-8 eggs each day for the next 16 days, Day 33-35
 Louse dies.<br>
Crabs were once the most common STD in existence, but have in recent years become one of the least seen infections, possibly, because those who are sexually active are choosing to shave off their pubic hair for an increase in pleasure during sex.<br>
The crabs, which are a distant relative of head lice, need to be treated as soon as possible.<br>
 Safe sex with condoms can help prevent the spread, but will likely do very
little since crabs is based in the sharing of the lice across 
 pubic regions, and not external sexual genitalia.<br>
 Symptoms: Itching in the pubic area.<br>
 Small lice appear in the hair of the pubic region, with small eggs implanted 
 just beneath the skin.<br>
 Treatment: Lice-killing lotion containing 1% permethrin or a mousse containing 
 pyrethrins and piperonyl butoxide can be used to treat 
 pubic (crab) lice.<br>
 Lindane shampoo is also effective for those with repeat outbreaks.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.2.16H">5.2.16</a> Scabies<br>
 Scabies, Sarcoptes scabiei<br>
<a href="../topics/topic16.html#16.1.1.1aH">16.1.1.1a</a>: Permethrin<br>
 Scabies is caused by the itch mite, <i>Sarcoptes scabiei</i>, "crabs", "sandy
crabs".<br>
 It burrows into the skin often between the fingers and on the wrists and
causes intense itching that is worse at night.<br>
 The entrances to the burrows have small scale-like swellings that become 
 red and itchy.<br>
 Transmission is by close body contact during sexual intercourse and sharing 
 clothes and bed linen with an infected person.<br>
 Treat it with a benzyl benzoate lotion applied externally to kill the mites
and eggs.<br>
 Also, prescription strength permethrin 5% ("Elimite", Lyclear") kills 
the scabies mite.<br>
 Wash all bedding and clothes used by the infected person.<br>
 Not always classified as an STD, the parasite Sarcoptes scabei, causes 
an extremely itchy rash that gets worse at night.<br>
 Scabies is most commonly found in folds of the skin, on the wrists and 
ankles, and in the genital area.<br>
 Symptoms: Scabies is incredibly contagious, and the mite can live for days
off the human body.<br>
 It is not only spread by close personal contact, but by skin-to-skin contact
in general, shared clothing, towels and bedding.<br>
 There is often plenty of scratching and red marks around the arms.<br>
 Treatment: Permethrin and Ivermectin the most effective treatment for scabies
and the treatment of choice.<br>
 It is applied from the neck down usually before bedtime and left on for 
 about eight to fourteen hours, then showered off in the morning.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.2.17H">5.2.17</a> Syphilis<br>
<a href="#11.1.11H">11.1.11</a> Syphilis contact tracing, <i>Treponema pallidum</i><br>
 Syphilis is caused by the bacterium <i>Treponema pallidum</i>.<br>
 The infection causes a painless sore on the mouth or genitals that disappears 
 after two weeks.<br>
 The sore feels like a button under the skin.<br>
 Treat the infection with antibiotics, e.g. penicillin.<br>
 Months after infection symptoms include a skin rash, patchy loss of hair, 
 moist lumps around the genitals or anus.<br>
 If not treated, these symptoms may disappear and then recur over the next
two years.<br>
 An untreated person may infect sexual partners during sexual intercourse.<br>
 Without treatment, the disease may become latent with. but reappear years 
 later with fatal consequences due to infection of the brain, 
 heart, large blood vessels, the spinal cord, skin and bones.<br>
 People infected with syphilis are infectious and should avoid all sexual 
 contact until advised by a doctor.<br>
 A pregnant woman who has syphilis can pass it on to her unborn baby that 
 may be born dead or badly damaged as a consequence.<br>
 <i>Treponema pallidum</i>, the bacteria that causes syphilis can become a very
serious battle for your body if left untreated.<br>
 Syphilis is transmitted by syphilis sores, which can appear on the external 
 genitals mouth, the vagina and rectum.<br>
 Be sure to check your partner before going into direct physical contact.<br>
 Because the sores are not only on the genitalia, the condom use that prevents
most STDs will only reduce your risk.<br>
 Symptoms: Lesions on the palms and the tops of the hands, and later several 
 red bumps running along the back.<br>
 Treatment: For uncomplicated a single dose of intramuscular penicillin 
G or oral azithromycin does the task.<br>
 Those who are seeking later treatment will need ten days of heavy IV penicillin.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.2.18H">5.2.18</a> Trichomoniasis<br>
Trichomoniasis, Trichomonas vaginalis<br>
<a href="#5.1.12H">See 5.1.12</a>: Trichomonas vaginalis contact tracing<br>
 Trichomoniasis is caused by the flagellated protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis.<br>
 It causes an unpleasant discharge and irritation of the vagina and painful 
 urination.<br>
 Treat the infection with antibiotics.<br>
 It is mainly spread by sexual intercourse.<br>
 The infection poses no great threat to health. but it often occurs along 
 with other STIs, e.g. gonorrhoea.<br>
 Women with trichomoniasis infection may become more easily infected with 
 AIDS.<br>
 So an infected person should be checked for other STI infections.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.2.1H">5.2.1</a> Bacterial vaginosis, 
 <i>Gardnerella vaginalis</i><br>
 This is probably not an STI, because women who are not sexually active, 
 or have never been sexually active, can be infected.<br>
 Women develop bacterial vaginosis soon after intercourse with a new sexual 
 partner.<br>
 Bacterial vaginosis is an overgrowth of various bacteria that are normally 
 present in the vagina.<br>
 Gardnerella is one bacterium that may be involved so sometimes the condition
is called "Gardnerella".<br>
 The reason this change in the vaginal bacteria occurs is not known.<br>
 It is not a serious disease and may require treatment only if symptoms 
cause distress or inconvenience.<br>
 Symptoms are irritation and vaginal discharge with an unpleasant odour.<br>
 To prevent Gardnerella, wipe from the front to the back, from vaginal area
to the anus after going to the toilet, not from anus to 
 vaginal area.<br>
 Keep wiping until the toilet paper is clean or wash the area.<br>
 The treatment is usually metronidazole tablets, "Flagyl".<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.2.2H">5.2.2</a> Candidiasis (Thrush)<br>
Candidiasis, thrush, is caused by the fungus <i>Candida albicans</i>, a yeast
that normally occurs in the mouth, vagina and intestines without 
 causing any symptoms.<br>
 It is not an STI, but sexual intercourse may irritate the vagina and allow
Candida albicans to grow.<br>
 It causes an itchy white vaginal discharge with a yeasty smell, swelling 
 and redness of the vagina, discomfort during intercourse, and 
 stinging when passing urine.<br>
 Repeated attacks may cause women to feel depressed and lose interest in
sexual intercourse.<br>
 Thrush is more likely to occur during pregnancy, by taking the contraceptive 
 pill after taking antibiotics that kill normal bacteria, during 
 the week before and after the period of the menstrual cycle, and, because 
 of diabetes when the immune system is suppressed.<br>
 When symptoms are noticed, the woman should see a doctor to have a swab 
 taken for testing whether it is <i>Candida albicans</i> or 
 another infection.<br>
 Doctors usually prescribe vaginal cream or pessaries.<br>
 It is important to complete the course of treatment.<br>
 The same cream should be applied to the penis under the foreskin.<br>
 Women patients should wear cotton underpants or loose flowing skirts.<br>
 They should not wear nylon pants, pantyhose or tight jeans.<br>
 Eating natural yoghurt with the course of antibiotics may help the bacteria 
 in the intestines return to normal when possible.<br>
 To avoid infection, after toilet wipe from front to back with toilet paper
to prevent risk of bowel bacteria contaminating the vaginal area.<br>
 After washing, women should gently wipe the vulva area dry.<br>
 Most soaps are alkaline and can neutralize the natural acidity of the body
so it is better to wash with water only in that area.<br>
 Avoid using heavily perfumed soaps or sprays in the genital area, as they
may cause irritation.<br>
 Thrush can be spread by sexual contact.<br>
 Men may also be affected, but usually less severely and do not necessarily 
 require treatment.<br>
 The symptoms for men are red spots on the penis, scrotum or groin.<br>
 Occasionally, <i>Candida albicans</i> may live under the foreskin of an uncircumcised
male, but he might be unaware of it if no discomfort occurs.<br>
 To avoid thrush, uncircumcised men should wash under the foreskin daily.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.2.5H">5.2.5</a> Cystitis<br>
 Cystitis, "honeymoon disease", <i>Escherichia coli</i> causes inflammation of the urethra (urethritis) and bladder (cystitis).<br>
 Cystitis is probably not an STI, because it is probably caused by poor toilet
hygiene before sexual intercourse.<br>
 It formerly was called the "honeymooner's disease".<br>
 Cystitis is an inflammation of the bladder caused by an infection of the
urinary tract by bacteria that normally live in the bowel.<br>
 The symptoms are a scalding feeling when passing urine (dysuria) a desire 
 to pass urine frequently, and a persistent dull ache above the 
 pelvic bone after passing urine.<br>
 Untreated cystitis can cause serious kidney infection.<br>
 Prevention includes better toilet hygiene as with Gardnerella, drinking
large quantities of water, washing the vulva with soft soap, 
 wearing cotton underpants and avoiding tight jeans.<br>
 If cystitis is suspected, see a doctor who will prescribe antibiotics and
perhaps conduct a pelvic examination to ensure the vagina is 
 healthy.<br>
 STIs also cause infection of the urethra.<br>
 People who learn they have cystitis can feel embarrassed, depressed and 
 anxious.<br>
 Cranberry juice is said to help deal with this disease.<br>
 Untreated cystitis can result in inflammation in the kidneys, pyelitis, 
 and pylonephritis leading to blood cells and pus in the urine.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.2.9H">5.2.9</a> Genital growths<br>
Balanitis, Molluscum contagiosum<br>
 Balanitis is inflammation, redness and soreness, of the head of the penis.<br>
 It is not an STI. but sexual intercourse may irritate the head of the penis
and lead to balanitis.<br>
 Men with foreskins are more likely to get this condition.<br>
 Treat the symptoms by keeping the head of the penis and the foreskin clean
and dry.<br>
 Sexual partners do not require treatment.<br>
 Molluscum contagiosum is a virus skin infection and appears on the genitals 
 and adjacent areas as round, pearly lumps with a central 
 white core.<br>
 It is a harmless condition and is treated by freezing with carbon dioxide.<br>
 It spreads by sexual and non-sexual contact.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.2.7H">5.2.7</a> Endometriosis<br>
 This condition that can lead to infertility, occurs when cells lining the
uterus begin to grow elsewhere, e.g. on the ovaries, fallopian 
 tubes, bladder and bowel.<br>
 Research has identified two regions of DNA close to gene WNT4, strongly 
 associated with this disorder and this may lead to a 
 diagnostic test for this painful gynaecological condition.<br>
 Environment factors may also be important for the development of this disease.<br>
