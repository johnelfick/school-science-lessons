<br>
Australian blood lime, (Citrus australasica var. sanguinea x 'Ellendale Mandarin' hybrid)<br>
Australian Citrus species are very vigorous and good candidates as rootstock for citrus grown in arid lands.<br>
The native Citrus species are notably different from all other species of citrus, suggesting an isolated and diverging evolution.<br>
As ornamentals they have great vigour and unusual fruit and foliage.<br>
They represent citrus relatives adapted to unusual soil conditions, extreme drought or rainforest conditions.<br>
<br>
Australian desert lime, (Citrus glauca), desert lime, small tree to 12 m high, greyish green, prominent oil glands, yellowish green berry, 
xerophyte, growing in dry areas and dropping its leaves under the stress of drought.<br>
In the summer it bears heavy crops of rounded yellow fruits 1 to 2 cm broad.<br>
Its rind is soft and less bitter than most members of the citrus group, the fruit makes excellent marmalade.<br>
