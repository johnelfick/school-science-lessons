<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.1.3H">9.1.3</a> Carbon dioxide gas is produced during respiration<br>
<a href="../images/9.154.gif">See diagram 9.154</a>: Limewater test for carbon dioxide in the breath.<br>
Plants (and animals) breathe in oxygen gas from the air to breakdown food into carbon dioxide gas and water.<br>
The energy stored in the food is then let out and can be used for growth, movement and to keep the plant (or animals) alive.<br>
This process is called respiration.<br>
Respiration equation: oxygen gas + simple sugar (food) --> carbon dioxide gas + water + energy.<br>
The carbon dioxide gas produced by respiration goes out into the air.<br>
Experiment<br>
Prepare limewater to test for carbon dioxide.<br>
Heat calcium carbonate (coral, shells), strongly to change it into quicklime, (calcium oxide).<br>
Add this to water, shake and stand for a few days until the top of the liquid is clear.<br>
To show the presence of carbon dioxide gas, breathe down a tube or a drinking straw to make bubbles in the clear liquid.<br>
The carbon dioxide gas will turn the clear liquid a white milky colour.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.5.1H">9.5.1</a> Carbon dioxide in the air is necessary for photosynthesis<br>
<a href="../images/9.151.gif">See diagram 9.151</a>: Split rubber stopper.<br>
 1. Insert a split rubber stopper firmly.<br>
 Smear petroleum jelly over the surface of the stopper to prevent any air entering the vessel either between the stopper and the neck or  between the stopper and the plant stem.<br>
 Place the apparatus in sunlight.<br>
 Leave for two days, then do the iodine tests for starch on a leaf from that part of the twig inside the vessel and also a leaf outside the vessel.<br>
The potassium hydroxide has absorbed the carbon dioxide in the enclosed air.<br>
2. Put a mature nasturtium plant in a plant pot in a dark place in the evening.<br>
<a href="../images/9.146.gif">See diagram 9.146</a>: Nasturtium.<br>
On the following morning, fill a glass container one third full with 20% potassium hydroxide solution.<br>
Place the nasturtium plant beside the glass container.<br>
Bend a leaf stem without breaking it and insert one leaf into the upper air filled section of the glass container.<br>
Cover the jar with a slotted cover to let the leaf stem to pass through the slot.<br>
Seal the slot around the stem with adhesive tape.<br>
Completely seal the glass container with adhesive tape.<br>
Potassium hydroxide absorbs carbon dioxide, so the leaf sealed inside the glass container is in air without carbon dioxide.<br>
Put the plant and culture jar in direct sunlight so that the leaf inside the glass container is exposed to the light source.<br>
After three hours, detach the leaf inside the glass container from the plant.<br>
Detach some other leaves, which have had equal exposure to light.<br>
Kill the cells in the leaves by dropping them into boiling water.<br>
After one minute, remove them with tweezers and place them in 96% ethanol.<br>
After 2 hours the leaves become almost colourless.<br>
Rinse the leaves in water and pour potassium iodide solution over them.<br>
Note which leaf is coloured blue violet by the iodine potassium iodide solution.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.1.11H">9.1.11</a> Respiration of flower heads over mercury<br>
<a href="../images/9.156.2.gif">See diagram 9.156.2</a>: Flowers in a flask.<br>
<b>Do NOT use elemental mercury for school experiments!</b><br>
 Collect living flowers and push them down into a flask.<br>
Invert the flask over mercury, so that the mouth of the flask is below the surface.<br>
Use a bent tube to introduce strong caustic potash solution to the surface of the mercury inside the neck of the flask.<br>
After a few hours, the mercury will rise inside the flask, because of the respiratory activity of the flowers.<br>
During the process, oxygen is absorbed from the enclosed atmosphere of the flask, and an almost equal volume of carbon dioxide is given off.<br>
The reduced volume of gases in the flask is owing to the absorption of carbon dioxide by the caustic potash.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.1.13H">9.1.13</a> Respiration of soaked peas over mercury<br>
<a href="../images/9.156.4.gif">See diagram 9.156.4</a>: Soaked peas over mercury.<br>
<b>Do NOT use elemental mercury for school experiments!</b><br>
1. Fill a test-tube with mercury and, sealing the end with the finger, invert it over a dish of mercury, with the mouth of the tube below the surface.<br>
Insert soaked peas, one at a time, into the mouth of the tube.<br>
These peas will rise to the top of the tube.<br>
Support the tube in this position with a clamp.<br>
After 24 hours, the peas will have given off a gas that has forced the mercury some distance down the tube.<br>
Show this gas to be carbon dioxide by allowing a strong caustic potash solution to rise into the test-tube from a bent tube inserted at the mouth.<br>
The potash, now in contact with the carbon dioxide, absorbs it, and the mercury rises again in the tube.<br>
2. To measure the respiration rate of soaked peas over mercury, insert the short end of an L-shaped tube into a flask containing soaked peas.<br>
Insert the long end of the tube into a reservoir of mercury and note the level of mercury in the tube.<br>
In time, the soaked peas will use all the oxygen in the flask and tube and change to anaerobic respiration with breakdown of starch reserves.<br>
Note the level of mercury in the tube at equal time intervals, e.g. every hour.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.1.20H">9.1.20</a> Tests for oxygen absorption during plant respiration<br>
<a href="../images/9.157.gif">See diagram 9.157</a> Burning time of candle flame.<br>
Plants take oxygen in and give carbon dioxide out during respiration.<br>
Green plants also take in carbon dioxide and give out oxygen during photosynthesis.<br>
Plant respiration can only be noted when there is no photosynthetic activity.<br>
So this experiment uses plants or parts of plants that have no chlorophyll necessary for photosynthesis, e.g. mushrooms or flowers of Compositae.<br>
Use the burning time of a candle in an enclosed known volume of air to prove the presence of oxygen.<br>
Smear the bottom edge of a 5 litre polystyrene bell jar with glycerine to provide a good seal, and is then put on a glass plate.<br>
Put a lighted candle in the bell jar using the candle holder.<br>
Close the neck of the bell jar immediately with the rubber stopper of the candle holder.<br>
Record the burning time of the candle.<br>
The candle burns for 90 to 120 seconds enclosed in the bell jar.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.1.14H">9.1.14</a> Respiratory quotient, Compositae flowers, mung bean seedlings<br>
<a href="../images/9.156.2.gif">See diagram 9.156.2</a>: Flower heads.<br>
The ratio of the quantity of carbon dioxide given out during respiration to the quantity of oxygen taken in CO2:O2, is called the respiratory quotient, RQ.<br>
If sugars are consumed in respiration, 6 moles of carbon dioxide and 6 moles of water are produced by the complete combustion of one mole of glucose by 6 moles of oxygen.<br>
C6H12O6 + 6O2 --> 6CO2 + 6H2O<br>
The carbon dioxide given out and the oxygen taken in are in the ratio 1.1, the respiratory quotient = 1.<br>
 If during respiration substances low in oxygen are consumed, oil, more oxygen must be used for the complete combustion to carbon  dioxide and water.<br>
 So the respiratory quotient is less than 1. If substances rich in oxygen are consumed, organic acids, the respiratory ratio rises above 1.<br>
<hr width="100%" size="2">Experiments:<br>
1. Respiratory quotient of Compositae flowers<br>
 Attach a double burette clamp to a Bunsen burner stand and clamp a respiration vessel to each side.<br>
 Fill both two thirds filled with small flowers of Compositae with the green leaflets of the calyx removed to prevent photosynthesis.<br>
 In one respiration vessel is placed a specimen tube containing 6 pellets of potassium hydroxide.<br>
 Smear the ground glass stoppers with glycerine to provide a good seal and insert in the respiration vessels.<br>
 Half fill two 100 mL beakers with deionized water and place them under the two respiration vessels.<br>
 Adjust the latter such that their capillary ends are immersed to a depth of 2 cm in the water.<br>
 Attach a scale to each capillary.<br>
 Warm both respiration vessels by placing a hand around them so that a few air bubbles escape from the capillaries.<br>
 On cooling, the deionized water rises into the region of the scale.<br>
 After 15 minutes record the level of the water in the two capillaries.<br>
 Repeat this every quarter of an hour.<br>
 The meniscus in the capillary of the respiration vessel containing potassium hydroxide rises uniformly.<br>
 The reduction in volume indicates the uptake of oxygen owing to the respiration of the flowers.<br>
 Only a small rise in the water level is noted in the other respiration  vessel so the amount of carbon dioxide given out must be almost as  much as the oxygen taken in.<br>
 The respiratory ratio of the flowers is thus 1. In general this applies  for all higher plants.<br>
 It clearly indicates that sugar is the predominant substance consumed in the respiration process.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.1.18H">9.1.18</a> Tests for carbon dioxide in the breath with limewater<br>
  <a href="../images/9.154.gif">See diagram 9.154</a>: Limewater test for carbon dioxide in the breath, (GIF)<br>
1. Prepare limewater.<br>
Calcium hydroxide is only slightly soluble in water.<br>
 Prepare the weak alkali calcium hydroxide solution, limewater, by adding 
solid calcium hydroxide, slaked lime, to demineralized water.<br>
 Shake vigorously and leave to stand.<br>
 Calcium hydroxide solid is only slightly soluble in water.<br>
 When the white solid has settled as a fine white sediment, decant the 
clear limewater above the sediment.<br>
 To replenish the limewater, add more demineralized to the sediment in 
the stock bottle, shake and leave to settle.<br>
 The settling process may take several days.<br>
2. Pass carbon dioxide from a gas cylinder or experiment
through the clear limewater.<br>
 The solution becomes milky, because of a fine precipitate of calcium carbonate.<br>
 Ca(OH)2 (aq) + CO2 (g) --> Ca(CO3)2 (s) + 2HCl (l)<br>
 Pass more carbon dioxide through the limewater.<br>
 The solution becomes clear again, because of the formation of soluble 
 calcium hydrogen carbonate.<br>
 CaCO3 (s) + CO2 (g) + H2O (l) --> Ca(HCO3)2 (aq)<br>
3. Pass air through freshly made limewater.<br>
After a long time you may see a faint cloudy precipitate.<br>
The air contains about 0.4% carbon dioxide.<br>
4. Pass the breath through freshly made limewater.<br>
<a href="../images/9.154.gif">See diagram 9.154</a>: Limewater test for carbon dioxide in the breath.<br>
 Use a drinking straw to exhale into the limewater.<br>
 A cloudy precipitate soon forms, because your exhaled breath contains 
about 4% carbon dioxide.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.1.12H">9.1.12</a> Respiration of small animals and temperature<br>
<a href="../images/4.9.12.2d.gif">See diagram 4.9.12.2d</a>: Effect of temperature.<br>
Use a U-tube to connect the syringe to the pipette and put the apparatus in a water bath.<br>
At each new temperature wait 10 minutes before taking readings.<br>
Do not use temperatures that cause discomfort to small animals.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.1.19H">9.1.19</a> Tests for gases collected in a respirometer<br>
<a href="../images/4.9.12.0.gif">See diagram 4.9.12.0</a>: Effect of temperature.<br>
1. Invert the apparatus so that the collected gas is near the open end of the syringe.<br>
Push the plunger to introduce a column of gas into the pipette.<br>
2. Seal the end of the gas column with the solution in the syringe to trap a column of 0.8 cm<sup>3</sup> gas inside the pipette.<br>
 Fix the apparatus in a vertical position.<br>
 3. Record the volume of gas in the pipette, V1.<br>
 4. Expel most of the solution at the lower end of the gas column.<br>
 Draw in some 2 M sodium hydroxide solution.<br>
 Keep the tip of the pipette in the sodium hydroxide solution and move 
the gas column up and down to assist the absorption of carbon 
 dioxide.<br>
 5. Record the volume of the gas column every five minutes until the reading, 
V2, becomes steady.<br>
 V2 measures the volume of the gas column without carbon dioxide.<br>
 % carbon dioxide =, V 1 - V2, / V1 × 100<br>
 Example result for pond <i>Selaginella</i>:<br>
 Initial volume of gas column, v = 0.75 cm<sup>3</sup><br>
 Volume of gas column after absorbing carbon dioxide, v<sup>2</sup>, = 
0.74 cm<sup>2</sup><br>
 Percentage of carbon dioxide = V1 - V2 × 100 = 1.33%<br>
 6. The percentage of oxygen in the gas collected in the syringe can
be estimated using alkaline pyrogallol solution.<br>
 However, this chemical is too dangerous for use in school science experiments.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.1.15H">9.1.15</a> Respiratory quotient using an alternative design respirometer<br>
<a href="../images/4.9.12.1d.gif">See diagram 4.9.12.1</a>: Alternative respirometer, grasshopper.<br>
<a href="../images/4.9.12.3d.gif">See diagram 4.9.12.3</a>: Alternative respirometer, pond weed.<br>
Make sure that the joints are airtight, e.g. between the rubber stopper and the boiling tube.<br>
If the rubber stopper loses its elasticity after a long period of storage, +ve an airtight condition is difficult.<br>
The respirometer is sensitive to volume changes owing to slight fluctuations in air temperature so errors in measurement may arise if you do not set up a control for comparison.<br>
When measuring the rate of photosynthesis by collecting the oxygen evolved from a pond weed, Figure I c, errors may occur if the gas bubbles generated from the cut ends of the aquatic stem are released at an erratic rate or in variable size, or when the gas bubbles are trapped on the leaf surface or wall of the apparatus.<br>
These errors make counting the number of gas bubbles evolved or measuring the volume of gas collected a less than reliable method for assessing the rate of photosynthesis.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.1.6H">9.1.6</a> Energy from peanuts<br>
 Put 20 mL of water in a test-tube.<br>
 Weigh a peanut (about 1 gram).<br>
 Push the blunt end of a needle into a cork then stick the sharp end into 
the peanut.<br>
 Record the temperature of the water in the test-tube.<br>
 Set alight the peanut with a Bunsen burner then immediately hold it under 
the test-tube.<br>
 Record the temperature of the water in the test-tube.<br>
 Weigh the burnt remains of the peanut.<br>
 Heat in calories = weight of water multiplied by the specific heat of 
water multiplied by the rise in temperature of the water.<br>
 One calorie = 4.186 joules, J.<br>
 Nutrition information often uses the kilocalorie, food Calorie = 1000 
calories.<br>
 Most school experimenters get values of about 12 kJ per gram, but nutrition 
information on food labels usually quote peanuts at 25 kJ 
 per gram and peanut butter at 27 kJ per gram.<br>
 Repeat the experiment with cashew, marshmallow and popcorn.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.1.5H">9.1.5</a> Energy from breakfast cereal<br>
 Repeat the previous experiment with breakfast cereal.<br>
 Compare the result of the experiment with the information on the packet.<br>
 The packet information is more accurate than this experiment, because 
 in a science laboratory, a "bomb calorimeter" is used to burn 
 food samples and calculate the energy stored from the increase in temperature 
of water around the bomb calorimeter.<br>
 No heat is lost or unaccounted for during this procedure so may find
that the calorific value on the packet may be three times the result 
 of this experiment.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.1.1H">9.1.1</a> Alcoholic fermentation, Yeast, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i><br>
<a href="../images/9.156.1.gif">See diagram 9.156.1</a>: Yeast with sucrose solution.<br>
<a href="../images/9.204.gif">See diagram 9.204</a>: Yeast cell forming bud.<br>
<a href="../images/11.209.3.gif">See diagram 11.209.3</a>: Wine and spirits hydrometer.<br>
Many organisms can breakdown organic substances without atmospheric oxygen, anaerobic degradation.<br>
The process is called fermentation.<br>
The amount of energy produced is less than in an aerobic reaction since further substances of varying energy content are formed.<br>
Instead of atmospheric oxygen the intermediate products of the decomposition are used here as hydrogen acceptors.<br>
Because the decomposition results from the splitting of molecules, the fermentation can also be defined as a dissimulation.<br>
Fission respiration, the most familiar example, is alcoholic fermentation.<br>
In the Bible is caution against putting new wine into old wine-skin containers.<br>
This action would burst the containers by the gases released by further fermentation: "Neither do men put new wine into old bottles [wine-skins]; else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish [are spoilt]" Matthew, ix, 17.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.6.18.1H">9.6.18.1</a> Alcoholic fermentation, yeast<br>
 1. Half fill a test-tube with water, add a piece of yeast the size of
a pea, and stir the mixture to produce a uniform suspension of the 
 yeast cells.<br>
 Three quarters fill two test-tubes with 10%t sucrose solution, and fill 
a third test-tube with the same amount of water.<br>
 Add 10 drops of water to one of the test-tubes containing sucrose solution, 
and add 10 drops of the yeast suspension to the other two 
 test-tubes.<br>
 The contents of each of the test-tubes are poured into fermentation 
tubes, taking care that the upright limbs of the tubes are completely 
 filled with liquid and contain no air bubbles.<br>
 During the next few days a gas collects in the upright limb of the fermentation 
tube containing sugar and yeast suspension.<br>
 No gas collects in the two control tubes, containing sucrose and water, 
or water and yeast suspension.<br>
2. Insert two pellets of potassium hydroxide in 
 the fermentation tube in which gas was produced.<br>
 The gas soon disappears, indicating the presence of carbon dioxide.<br>
 Pour the contents of this fermentation tube into a flat glass dish and 
note the distinct smell of alcohol.<br>
 Yeasts ferment sugar to produce alcohol and carbon dioxide.<br>
3. Half fill a test-tube with water, add a piece 
 of yeast the size of a pea, and stir the mixture to produce a uniform 
 suspension of the 
 east cells.<br>
 Three quarters fill two test-tubes with 10% sucrose solution, and fill 
a third test-tube with the same amount of water.<br>
 Add 10 drops of water to one of the test-tubes containing sucrose solution, 
and add 10 drops of the yeast suspension to the other 
 two test-tubes.<br>
The contents of each of the test-tubes are poured into fermentation tubes, taking care that the upright limbs of the tubes are completely filled with liquid and contain no air bubbles.<br>
In the course of the next few days a gas collects in the upright limb of the fermentation tube containing sugar and yeast suspension.<br>
This does not happen in the control tubes, containing sucrose and water, or water and yeast suspension.<br>
 If 1-2 pellets of potassium hydroxide are inserted in the fermentation 
 tube in which gas was produced, the gas disappears within a few 
 minutes, indicating the presence of carbon dioxide.<br>
 On pouring out the contents of this fermentation tube into a flat glass 
dish, the smell of alcohol is very distinct.<br>
 Yeasts ferment sugar to give alcohol and carbon dioxide.<br>
4. Experiments, which students can do at home, e.g. bread yeast, Kombucha, junket, rennin<br>
Students must set up a consistent way of measuring if a reaction has happened or not, using observations.<br>
Instead of waiting for proof of 'setting', it is easier for students to observe precipitation by mixing and allowing time to settle.<br>
This also means that with temperature reactions where you need to cool down quickly, the mixing helps this process.<br>
Experiment:<br>
Measure reaction time at different temperatures by mixing up yeast solutions at different temperatures and collecting multiple samples of the solution in pipettes.<br>
Placed these samples into test tubes filled with water and counted the bubbles produced per minute.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.1.2H">9.1.2</a> Butyric acid fermentation 
<a href="../images/9.161.gif">See diagram 9.161</a>: Cut potato.<br>
The soil contains micro-organisms, among which are spores and vegetative 
rods of <i>Bacillus amylobacter</i>.<br>
This bacillus is able to breakdown the middle lamella of plant cells forming, 
among other things, butyric acid CH3-CH2-CH2-COOH.<br>
From this breakdown it obtains the energy necessary for the maintaining 
 of its metabolic processes.<br>
Butyric acid fermentation is of practical importance in flax and hemp 
production since it loosens the bundles of fibres from the 
 structural matter of the stalks.<br>
 <i>Bacillus amylobacter</i> is the most important butyric acid producer
 in the soil.<br>
 The following experiment shows its activity:<br>
 Make a cut in a medium size potato, infected by rubbing soil into it.<br>
 It is well covered with water, contained in a 600 mL beaker, and left 
to stand at room temperature.<br>
 After 5 days a vigorous fermentation process can be seen to be taking
 place.<br>
 Bubbles of gas rise from the cut made in the potato.<br>
 It smells of butyric acid.<br>
 The spores and vegetative rods of <i>Bacillus amylobacter</i> present
 in the garden or arable soil can develop and propagate under the 
 above experimental conditions.<br>
 The bacillus breaks down the middle lamella of the potato cells, wet
rot, thus forming butyric acid.<br>
 <i>Bacillus amylobacter</i> is anaerobic, dislikes oxygen, so potatoes

<a href="../images/6.6.20.gif">See diagram 6.6.20</a>: Gas produced from fermentation.<br>
 Wear safety glasses and rubber gloves to complete all tasks.<br>
 1. Prepare 180 mL of glucose solution at 10% (w/v).<br>
 Dissolve 18 g of glucose powder in distilled water and make up to 180 
mL.<br>
 Add the glucose solution to a 250 mL conical flask and warm to the ideal 
temperature for yeast activity using the thermometer, a hot 
 plate, incubator, water bath or Bunsen burner.<br>
 Weigh 1.5 g of dried brewer's yeast onto filter paper and add the yeast 
to the glucose solution in the conical flask.<br>
 Gently stir the yeast and glucose solution.<br>
 To allow gases to escape, reduce loss of alcohol by evaporation, and 
avoid bacteria or fungi contamination, fix cotton balls firmly into 
 the neck of the flask and put 5 cm square of aluminium foil to sit on 
top of the flask.<br>
2. Weigh the flask, solution, cotton wool balls 
 and aluminium foil square and record the initial mass, M1.<br>
 Maintain the solution at 20-25<sup>o</sup>C, if not specified differently 
 on the yeast packet.<br>
 The time required for fermentation may be 24 hours at ideal temperature
 and gently stirred, or aerated, or up to 5-6 days, if just left on 
 a window sill.<br>
 Fermentation is completed when no more bubbles are released.<br>
 Reweigh the flask, fermented solution, cotton wool balls and aluminium 
 foil square, M2.<br>
 Calculate any changes in mass, M1- M2.<br>
3. Secure the rubber stopper into the top of 
 the flask with the tubing fitted snugly through the stopper.<br>
 Maintain the solution at the ideal temperature for fermentation.<br>
 When bubbles form to show that fermentation is taking place, measure
 25 mL limewater into a test-tube and immerse the end of the 
 tubing into the limewater.<br>
 Observe and record any changes in the appearance of the limewater.<br>

 Also find a similar branch, pull all the leaves off and tie another dry

 The bag over the bare branch has no water in it.<br>
Both bags were dry when put on the branches.].<br>
 Where did the water come from? [The leaves.].<br>
 The loss of water by leaves is called transpiration.<br>
 Leaves give out water when they are growing in the sunlight.<br>
 The sunlight heats the water and turns it into water vapour.<br>
 This is called evaporation.<br>
 When a liquid is heated, it forms a gas.<br>
 This gas is called a vapour.<br>
 The water vapour comes out through holes in the lower side of the leaf.<br>
 The loss of water by evaporation cools the leaf.<br>
 (Special note: This is a difficult idea.<br>
 The sun heats the water in the leaf, but the water evaporating cools the leaf.).<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.2.5H">9.2.5</a> Path of the transpiration
 stream, cut flower stems in ink<br>
 Herbaceous plants lose several hundred times their own weight of water 
in a day, mostly through stomata on the leaves.<br>
 Within the mesophyll of the leaf a large wet surface is exposed to enable 
the adsorption of carbon dioxide for photosynthesis.<br>
 When the air outside the leaf is drier than the air within, water vapour 
can diffuse out through the stomates causing more water to 
 evaporate from the leaf cells.<br>
 Then the suction pressure of the leaf cells rises, draws water from the 
veins and creating negative hydrostatic pressure in them to draw 
 water up the xylem vessels.<br>
 The xylem vessels are merely pipes and the water flows passively so water 
can be made to flow in the reverse direction by sealing the 
 normal base end, cutting off the apex of the shoot and dipping the cut 
stem into water.<br>
Experiments<br>
 1. To show that the leaves are mainly responsible for causing the flow 
of water, you can remove leaves and compare the rates of water 
 movement.<br>
 Use two leafy shoots of balsam to study of water conduction in stems.<br>
 Cut a fresh surface on the lower end of each shoot with a sharp razor 
blade, keeping the end wet under water as you cut.<br>
 Leave in water for at least two minutes.<br>
 Place one shoots in a tube of dye provided and watch continuously until 
you see colour rise in the vascular bundles in the stem and has 
 reached the leaves.<br>
 Remove the other shoot from the water, dry the cut end and seal with
petroleum jelly.<br>
 Cut the stem under water near the terminal rosette and leave inverted
 in water for two minutes.<br>
 Transfer the shoot to the dye provided and watch continuously until you 
see colour flow.<br>
 Note that the direction of flow is the reverse of that previously noted.<br>
2. Stand the cut stems of white flowers and some 
 cut shoots in dilute red ink or eosin dye.<br>

water lost through transpiration.<br>
 Water travels up cut stems by capillary action.<br>
1. Cut the stem of a white flower, e.g. carnation 
or lily, under water with a one-sided razor blade or exacto knife.<br>
 Keep the cut end wet then put it into a red dye, e.g. red ink diluted

 After some hours the petal will change colour.<br>
 1a. Repeat the experiment by carefully cutting the flower stem lengthways.<br>
 Put one cut end in red ink solution and the other cut end in blue ink solution.<br>
 After some hours the white flower will have two colours.<br>
2. Examine the arrangement of vascular bundles 
 in the stalk.<br>
 Use a one-sided razor blade to cut thin wedge-shaped slices, e.g. maize, 
buttercup, tulip, iris.<br>
 Cut off a small piece at the end of the stalk with a cut perpendicular 
 to the axis and cut away from you or cut plant material down on a

 Invert the large jar and place it over the potted plant and dish of calcium

 Also, put a dish containing a known weight of calcium chloride in a large 
jar.<br>
 Leave to stand for 6 hours then again weigh the calcium chloride.<br>
 Note an increase in the weight of calcium chloride in 1.1 whereas in 
1.2 there is no change in weight of calcium chloride.<br>
 The calcium chloride becomes heavier, because it absorbed water from transpiration.<br>
 The calcium chloride in 1.2 did not absorb any water and remained the 
same weight, because the leaves were covered by the petroleum 
 jelly that prevented the loss of any water vapour by transpiration.<br>
3. Find the surface of the leaf through which 
 transpiration takes place more rapidly.<br>
 Fix one piece of dry cobalt (II) chloride paper on the upper surface

 Apply petroleum jelly to where the jar touches the glass to ensure that 
the apparatus is airtight.<br>
 Leave the experiment for two hours then note how fast any change in
colour takes place in the cobalt (II) chloride papers.<br>
 The piece of dry cobalt (II) chloride paper attached to the lower surface 
of the leaf changed from blue to pink much more rapidly than

 Many plants have protective devices to control transpiration.<br>
 Compare the water lost by an unpeeled and a peeled potato.<br>
 Use two potatoes of different size.<br>
 Peel the larger potato and weigh it.<br>
 After peeling it should still be heavier than the unpeeled potato.<br>
 Cutting small slices from the peeled potato until the peeled and unpeeled 
potato have the same weight.<br>
 Put each potato in an open flat glass dish and leave them at room temperature.<br>
 Weigh both potatoes at the same time each day and record the results.<br>
2. Apple peel provides protection against loss 
 of water by evaporation.<br>
 Select two apples of equal size.<br>
 Peel one apple as thinly as possible and leave the other apple as a control.<br>
 Put each apple in a beaker and weigh the apple + beaker.<br>
 Leave the apples to stand for some days.<br>
 During the next few days, the peeled apple shrinks and becomes increasingly 
wrinkled.<br>
 However, the unpeeled apple shows no noticeable changes.<br>
 Weigh each apple + beaker again.<br>
 Calculate the percentage loss in weight of the two apples.<br>
 The peel of an apple is only very slightly permeable to water so water 
can only evaporate only slowly from the fruit pulp inside it.<br>
 If the skin is not removed or damaged, fruit can be stored for a long

 cobalt (II) chloride then dry in an oven.<br>
 The dry cobalt (II) chloride paper is blue when dry, but turns pink when 
exposed to a humid atmosphere or dipped in water.<br>
 Store the dry cobalt (II) chloride paper in a sealed test-tube or in
a desiccator or over anhydrous calcium chloride.<br>
 Put a piece of dry cobalt (II) chloride paper in contact with the upper

 Note the time required for the blue colour to fade for each piece of
dry cobalt (II) chloride paper.<br>
3. Do a similar experiment with dried copper (II)
 sulfate paper.<br>
 This liquid turns white anhydrous copper (II) sulfate to blue.<br>
 This liquid turns blue paper soaked in cobalt (II) chloride solution 
pink.<br>
 So the liquid is water.<br>
 This water could not have come from any other source except the plant.<br>
4. Plants continuously evaporate water and absorb

 Insert rooted shoots of <i>Tradescantia</i> with well-developed leaves.<br>
 Pour paraffin oil on the water so that no water can evaporate from the surface.<br>
 The leaves of the <i>Tradescantia</i> shoots, inside the measuring cylinder 
above the layer of paraffin, and outside the measuring cylinder must 
 all be completely dry.<br>
 Wipe any drops of water off them with absorbent paper.<br>
 Record the level of the water surface in the measuring cylinder, e.g. 
98.5 mL.<br>
 Put the measuring cylinder on a sheet of glass and place a large jar
over the measuring cylinder.<br>
 Where the rim of the large jar touches the glass make a seal with petroleum 
jelly so no air or water can enter or leave the large jar.<br>
 By the following day, drops of water have appeared on the inside surface 
of the large jar and the level of the water in the measuring 
 cylinder has fallen.<br>
 The <i>Tradescantia</i> shoots have absorbed water then lost water through 
their leaves as water vapour that has condensed on the inside 
 surface of the large jar.<br>
 Absorbing water through the roots must compensate for loss of transpired 
 water from the leaves.<br>

 Nothing happens.<br>
 Put a green leaf in hot water.<br>
 Bubbles of air come from holes in the lower side of the leaf where the 
stomates are situated.<br>

 Use a well-watered plant in a flowerpot, e.g. Pelargonium (geranium)
or <i>Fuchsia</i>.<br>
 Cover the surface of the soil and the sides and base of the flowerpot
 with plastic sheet.<br>
 Cover the soil surface in the flowerpot with a plastic sheet with a
slit for the stem.<br>
 Seal around the stem with rubber solution.<br>
 Fix the ends of the plastic sheet to the flowerpot so no moisture can 
be lost to the air.<br>
 Weight the whole apparatus then stand in sunlight for several hours.<br>
 Weigh the whole apparatus again and note any loss in weight, because of 
transpiration.<br>

<a href="../images/9.3.43.gif">See diagram 9.3.43</a>: Potometer to measure transpiration. (It may be called "Ganong's potometer".)<br>
 1. A potometer measures the rate of water intake rather than transpiration.<br>
 However, assume that water intake equals water loss by evaporation in the transpiration stream.<br>
 Select a leafy shoot from a plant that has leaves with thin waxy cuticles, e.g. <i>Hibiscus</i>, <i>Bauhinia</i>, <i>Ligustrum</i>, <i>Pelargonium</i>,  (geranium).<br>
 Bend the stem of the shot under water and cut the stem so that no bubbles attach to the cut end.<br>
 Trim the cut with a razor blade.<br>
 Select a cork borer of slightly bigger diameter than the stem of the shoot and apply petroleum jelly to the outside of the cylinder.<br>
 Pass the cork borer through a hole in a 3-hole cork stopper, working  from below then place the stopper and attached cork borer  under water.<br>
 Flood the apparatus to eliminate any air bubbles.<br>
 Air bubbles in the xylem may prevent potometer working properly.<br>
 Still working under water, slide the end of the shoot into the end of the cork borer working from above.<br>
 Remove the cork borer by pulling downward.<br>
 The end of the capillary tube must not stick out below the cork stopper because air may become trapped there.<br>
 When all the air is eliminated from the apparatus, close the reservoir  tap, remove the apparatus from the water.<br>
 Leave the apparatus for four hours.<br>
2. Lift the end of the bent capillary glass tube  to introduce a small bubble into it.<br>
 After the bubble moves around the bend in the capillary tube and parallel to the scale, note the time taken by the bubble to move  towards the cut shoot.<br>
 This movement is a measure of the rate of transpiration.<br>
 Measure the rate of transpiration under different conditions, e.g. wind velocity with fast and slow fan, and temperature.<br>
3. Put a leaf on graph paper and draw a line around the leaf margin to measure the leaf area then calculate  the rate of transpiration per cm<sup>2</sup> of leaf.<br>

<a href="../images/9.193.gif">See diagram 9.193</a>: Transpiration through stomates.<br>
 1. Half fill with water four identical containers, A, B, C, D.<br>
 Prepare two similar leafy shoots A1 and B1, each with two similar leaves.<br>
 Smear petroleum jelly over both sides of the leaves of B1.<br>
 A1 is the control.<br>
 Cut the ends of both stems under water.<br>
 Pick up each stem carefully so that a drop of water sticks to the cut end.<br>
 Put each stem in its container.<br>
 Adjust the level of water in the four containers to the same height.<br>
 Add 0.5 cm of cooking oil to containers A, B and C.<br>
 Use a grease pencil to mark the original water level on each container.<br>
 Leave the stems in the sunlight for hours then the next day record the water levels in each container.<br>
 Repeat the experiment using an electric fan.<br>
 Container, B is the experiment and containers A, C and, D are controls.<br>
2. Choose four similar leaves of a plant with thin
 leaves and stomates only on the lower sides of the leaves.<br>
 2.1 Smear both surfaces of leaf 1 with petroleum jelly.<br>
 2.2 Smear only the upper surface of leaf 2 with petroleum jelly.<br>
 2.3 Smear only the lower surface of leaf 3 with petroleum jelly.<br>
 2.4 Let leaf 4 hang freely in the air as a control without smearing it with petroleum jelly.<br>
 The next day, examine the leaves.<br>
 Leaf 1 and leaf 3 show signs of wilting.<br>
 Leaf 2 and leaf 4 show no signs of wilting.<br>

<a href="../images/9.195.gif">See diagram 9.195</a>: Water level drops.<br>
 1. Remove a nasturtium plant from a pot or the soil.<br>
 Wash the plant and put it into a jar of water.<br>
 Pour oil on the surface of the water.<br>
 Note the level of the oil in the jar.<br>
 Hours later, note the level of the oil again.<br>
 Water has been lost from the jar by transpiration through the plant.<br>
2. Put water in a jar.<br>
 Mark the water level.<br>
 Fix plastic cling film over the top of the jar.<br>
 Cut a slit in the cling film just long enough to insert through it the stem of a plant.<br>
 Use some glue to seal the slit.<br>
 The water level will drop as the plant stem absorbs water.<br>
3. Use measuring cylinders of water with stem 
 sample inserted then a thin layer of vegetable oil to stop evaporation.<br>
 This experiment can be left set up in sunny, shaded, warm, hot, cold areas for weeks if the students maintain the water level.<br>
 Use larger test-tubes in racks if not enough measuring cylinders and let students devise their own scales.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.2.4H">9.2.4</a> Guttation<br>
If you observe a heavy dew on grass early in the morning, some of the moisture may not have come from the air, but from guttation by the grass.<br>
Guttation occurs on cool clear nights when stomates are closed to reduce water lost by transpiration.<br>
However, water lost occurs by xylem through modified stomates called hydathodes along the edges of leaves  or at leaf blade tips.<br>
Although observed usually in grasses, guttation occurs in hundreds of genera.<br>
It may occur during the day in very humid tropical regions with high soil temperature to assist in loss of water by transpiration.<br>
Also, it may cause negative osmotic pressure in the xylem compared to the osmotic pressure of the soil water.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.2.8H">9.2.8</a> The "heartbeats" of trees<br>
Until now, scientists thought water moved through trees by osmosis, in a somewhat continuous manner.<br>
The trunks and branches of trees are actually contracting and expanding to "pump" water up from the roots to the leaves, similar to how our heart pumps blood.<br>
However, a tree's pulse is much slower, "beating" once every two hours or so.<br>
Instead of regulating blood pressure, the heartbeat of a tree, regulates water pressure.<br>
Most trees have regular periodic changes in shape, synchronized across the whole plant, which imply periodic changes in water pressure.<br>
Andras Zlinszky of Aarhus University in the Netherlands used terrestrial laser scanning to monitor 22 tree species to see how the shape of their canopies changed.<br>
The measurements were taken in greenhouses at night to rule out sun and wind as factors in the trees' movements.<br>
In several of the trees, branches moved up and down by about a centimetre or so every couple of hours.<br>
They have charted the changing of movement in a magnolia tree.<br>
After studying the nocturnal tree activity, the researchers came up with a theory about what the movement means.<br>
They believe the motion is an indication that trees are pumping water up from their roots, so it is a type of "heartbeat.".<br>
"In classical plant physiology, most transport processes are explained as constant flows with negligible fluctuation in time".<br>
"No fluctuations with periods shorter than 24 hours are assumed or explained by current models".<br>
He said: "The trunk gently squeezes the water, pushing it upwards through the xylem, whose main job is to transport water and nutrients from roots to shoots and leaves.<br>
Their new discovery is something entirely different, they say, because the these movements happen at much shorter intervals.<br>
