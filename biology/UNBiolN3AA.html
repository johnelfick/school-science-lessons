<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="ArabidopsisthalianaH"></a>Thale crest, (Arabidopsis thaliana)<br>
Thale crest, (Arabidopsis thaliana), mouse ear cress, rock cress, mustard weed, is a little environmental weed that lives on waste spaces.<br>
Nobody cared about it, because it has no edible uses, although is used in folk medicine to cure sores in the mouth.<br>
Carl Linnaeus named the plant (Arabis thaliana) in honor of Johannes Thal, first described in 1577, in the Harz Mountains, Northern Germany.<br>
But some people think Thaliana is a rare girls' name from ancient Greece, and means "to blossom".<br> 
 <a href="../images/Arabidopsis1.jpg">See diagram</a>: Thale crest, (Arabidopsis thaliana).<br>
Herby growers recommend to water it 0.5 cups every 9 days, put it 91.44 cm from a window, and repot into a 4 inch pot when it has 
doubles its height, and make sure that it does not get direct sunlight!<br>
The little plant was ignored by most herb growers, but scientists loved it, because its entire life cycle in six weeks, it self-pollinates, and it can be grown in their 
Petri dishes, without needing to get dirty in the garden.<br> 
 <a href="../images/Arabidopsis3.jpg">See diagram</a>: (Arabidopsis thaliana) growing in a Petri dish.<br>
The botanists said that (Arabidopsis thaliana) is a sort of annual-biennial, grows up 25 cm tall, with a basal rosette and a few purplish serrated margin leaves.<br> 
Only in this plant the leaves are covered with small, unicellular hairs, with three branches, called trichomes.<br>
<a href="../images/Arabidopsis2.jpg">See diagram</a>: Trichomes, (Arabidopsis thaliana).<br>
The flowers are 3 mm in diameter, in a slightly convex head, like most Brassicaceae.<br>
An 5+ mm long, two-valved seed pod contains up to 30 tiny seeds.<br> 
The plant has a single primary root that grows vertically downward, later producing smaller lateral roots.<br> 
These roots are friendly with rhizosphere bacteria, such as (Bacillus megaterium), which can get inside the roots.<br>
In year 2000, the entire genome of (Arabidopsis thaliana) was sequenced, so it was the first plant to have its genome fully mapped.<br>
It has five chromosomes, with total size of approximately 135-megabases, 27,000 genes, and a TIGR golden path length at 119,146,348 bp, so it is OK.<br>
<a href="../images/Arabidopsis5.jpg">See diagram</a>: The 5 chromosomes in (Arabidopsis thaliana).<br>
It was used in research related to plant responses to environmental stresses, such as drought and salinity, and make it more resilient to climate change.<br>
(Arabidopsis thaliana) became the most-studied plants on the earth.<br>
Most scientists thought they knew enough about (Arabidopsis thaliana) and returned to study their old friend, the fruit fly, (Drosophila melanogaster).<br>
Recently, University of Queensland researchers have for the first time introduced genetic material into plants via their roots, opening a potential pathway 
for rapid crop improvement.<br>
They used T-DNA: Transfer DNA used in plant transformation techniques to insert genes into the genomes of plants.<br>
They got (Arabidopsis thaliana) to absorb very small nanopartice of genetic material, mRNAs, by coating the nanoparticle with a protein that gently loosens 
the cell wall.<br>
The synthetic mRNA produces a green fluorescent protein into the plant and turns the whole root green.<br>
<a href="../images/Arabidopsis4.jpg">See diagram</a>: Green fluorescent protein from mRNA in (Arabidopsis thaliana).<br>
The UQ scientists tricked (Arabidopsis thaliana), because it thought is was just absorbing rhizosphere bacteria!
This discovery could help fine-tune plant genes to increase crop yield and improve food quality by producing a new crop variety, which is normally 
time-consuming and expensive.<br>
