 of the seed<br>
<a href="./images/9.76.gif">See diagram 9.76</a>: Parts of a seed.<br> 
 A seed is a megasporangium containing an embryo and food.<br> 
 It is the post fertilization transformation of an ovule.<br> 
 The embryo is the new diploid generation.<br> 
 The endosperm, the female gametophyte, and the nucellus and seed coats 
are the parent diploid generation.<br> 
 1. In an open 100 mm diameter flat glass dish put five bean seeds for 
swelling.<br> 
 Next day pick out a seed that has swollen nicely for close observation.<br> 
 The first thing that strikes you is that the bean seed is enclosed in 
a relatively tough skin.<br> 
 Because of the swelling this skin nearly always bursts and can be easily 
 removed with a pair of forceps.<br> 
 The skin is called the seed pod.<br> 
 The seed pod encloses two whitish, thick, fleshy formations.<br> 
 Their outline is kidney shape.<br> 
 These are the two seed leaves, cotyledons.<br> 
 With the forceps take one seed leaf, without crushing it, and bend the 
second a little to one side with a dissecting needle.<br> 
 By doing this you can see that both seed leaves hang together at one end.<br> 
 At this spot there are two whitish, small leaflets.<br> 
 They lie folded in between the two seed leaves.<br> 
 They are the first leaves of the subsequent bean plant.<br> 
 They rest on a very short, delicate stalk that merges at its other end 
into a pointed peg, the root.<br> 
 The seed contains a complete miniature model plant, called the embryo.<br> 
 State the parts that go to make up the bean seed.<br> 
 Do a simple drawing showing the parts and their position in relation to
each other.<br> 
 How many seed leaves has the bean seed?<br>
 In seed plants you can distinguish between one seed leaf, monocotyledon, 
 and two seed leaves, dicotyledon, plants.<br> 
 To which group does the bean plant belong? [Fabaceae]<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.3.2H">9.3.2</a> Drinking glass garden<br>
<a href="./images/9.3.50.gif">See diagram 9.3.50</a>: Drinking glass garden.<br> 
 Put rolled paper towels into the drinking glass.<br> 
 Fill the centre with peat moss, cotton, sawdust, or wood shavings.<br> 
 Put a piece of graph paper with water insoluble ink, cut to size, between 
 the glass and the paper.<br> 
 Plant bean seeds between the paper and the glass.<br> 
 Water the centre of the glass.<br> 
 Make frequent observations of growth, using the graph paper lines as reference
points.<br> 
 Results may be presented by constructing graphs that show time on the 
horizontal axis and the root and stem elongation in millimetres 
 along the vertical axis.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.3.6H">9.3.6</a> Enzyme activity during 
 germination<br>
 At the start of germination, the substances stored in the seeds must be
converted into a form that can be utilized by the seedling which, 
 at first, is not nutritionally and physiologically independent.<br> 
 To do this it is necessary to activate the enzymes that cause these conversions.<br> 
 About 10 bean seeds and 10 maize seeds are placed in flat glass dishes
 half filled with water and left to swell for 2 days.<br> 
 The contents of four tubes containing starch agar are liquefied by warming 
 the water bath and poured out into four half flat glass dishes.<br> 
 The swollen seeds are halved longitudinally and placed, separately according 
 to species, with the cut surface downwards into two half 
 flat glass dishes containing starch agar.<br> 
 For control purposes halved unswollen bean and maize seeds are similarly 
 placed in the two remaining dishes containing starch agar.<br> 
 All the dishes are placed in the glass tank, it is filled to half the 
height of the dishes with water and then covered with the glass disk, 
 forming a moist chamber.<br> 
 In order to inhibit, as far as possible, the development of bacteria or
mildew, the test assembly is left at a temperature of 15<sup>o</sup>C.<br> 
 After 2 days, dilute iodine potassium iodide solution is dropped onto 
the starch agar in all the dishes.<br> 
 The starch agar turns blue violet.<br> 
 However, a fairly bright halo is to be seen around the swollen seeds, 
which is not present around the unswollen seeds.<br> 
 On swelling, and with it the incipient germination, the amylase contained 
 in the seeds is activated.<br> 
 It transforms starch into sugar that becomes available to the seedling.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.3.9H">9.3.9</a> Conditions necessary for germination, After-ripening<br>
 1. A seed can germinate only if the following conditions are present:<br>
* presence of water,<br>
* presence of oxygen,<br>
* presence of adequate temperature.<br> 
* the after-ripening period has elapsed.<br> 
After-ripening may be a period of usually several months of dry storage at room temperature of freshly harvested, mature seeds, to release dormancy and to promote germination of fully-developed seeds.<br> 
For example, white light promotes dormancy in freshly harvested cereal grains, but dark and after-ripening have the opposite effect.<br> 
After-ripening prevents germination prior to the completion of seed maturation.<br> 
2. To show that water is necessary for the germination of seeds, fill two flat glass dishes with dry garden soil to a depth of 1 cm.<br> 
Ensure that the soil is dry by spreading it out on a sheet of paper and letting it dry until it can be crumbled into dust.<br> 
Then put it in the dishes.<br> 
In each of two other flat glass dishes put three circular filters and smooth them out on the bottom of the dishes.<br> 
In each of the four flat glass dishes put 10 dry bean or pea seeds.<br> 
In the dishes containing garden soil, the seeds should just peep out of the soil.<br> 
Into one of the two dishes with the circular filters pour just enough water to cover the seeds.<br> 
Into one of the two dishes containing soil pour just enough water for the soil to be well and evenly moistened.<br> 
Put the lids on the dishes so that the water does not evaporate too quickly from the dishes that have been kept moist.<br> 
After 24 hours, the seeds that have been lying in water in the flat glass 
 dish without soil have soaked up most of the water.<br> 
 Keep on pouring more water into this dish, but only enough for the filters 
 on which the seeds are resting to be very moist.<br> 
 Note in which dishes the seeds germinate.<br> 
Experiment<br>
"Comment from teacher:<br>
Students set up a prac to investigate the conditions needed for germination.<br> 
They often confuse light as always being necessary.<br> 
I then taught more ecology and covered dryland salinity.<br> 
I then directed the students in this direction.<br> 
Modifications were simple to implement (salt %, change of growth media, containers and conditions, measurements etc).<br> 
There was also a move to peas, snow peas and beans as there is a better effect with these seeds.<br> 
We gathered sufficient data just by measuring a germination percentage and then shoot length."\<br> 
Examine the conditions necessary for germination.<br>
Use: Lettuce seeds, Petri Dishes, Water, Paper Towel.<br>
1. Label 4 Petri Dishes with your name and the date.<br> 
2. Label 1 Petri Dish RTL (room temperature, light), 1 RTD (room temperature, dark), 1 FRI (fridge, dark) and 1 RTNW (room temperature, no water, dark).<br> 
3. Fill each Petri Dish with paper towel (2 layers thick).<br> 
4. Water 3 of the dishes so the paper towel is damp.<br> 
5. Place 10 seeds evenly on the top of the paper towel in each container.<br> 
6. Cover each dish with the lids.<br> 
7. Place each Petri Dish in the correct environment.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.4.1H">9.4.1</a> Geotropism responses using a clinostat<br>
See: <a href="./commercial/Commercial.html#Clinostats">Clinostats</a>, (Commercial).<br> 
<a href="./images/9.3.59.gif">See diagram 9.3.59:</a> Geotropism.<br> 
1. Grow maize or wheat on a rotating turntable, axis horizontal.<br> 
Tropisms take the form of movement, or turning, in relation to the direction from which the stimulus comes.<br> 
Geotropism is the tropism that occurs in response to the stimulus caused by the earth's gravitational field.<br> 
Tip a pot plant on its side.<br> 
After about a week, the growing point of the stem turns upwards as auxin accumulates on the lower side and makes these cells grow longer than cells on the upper side.<br> 
2. Leave seeds to swell in water.<br> 
The next day sow them in a flowerpot filled with sawdust.<br> 
Fix a wire gauze square over the flowerpot.<br> 
Invert the flowerpot and fix it over a container of water with the water touching the rim of the flowerpot.<br> 
Keep the sawdust dump by watering through the hole in the bottom of the flower pot.<br> 
After a few days roots grow through the wire gauze down towards the damp air in the container of water.<br> 
After 10 days remove the sawdust from the flower pot and note that the shoots have grown upwards from the seed into the sawdust.<br> 
3. Plant seeds in a two flowerpots, e.g. oats, radish, or mustard.<br> 
When the seedlings emerge, attach the first flowerpot horizontally to the vertical disc of a clinostat turntable or record player.<br> 
Switch on the clinostat so that it turns slowly.<br> 
Lay the second flowerpot on its side.<br> 
After a few days the plants in the flowerpot on its side have become curved with their shoots pointing up.<br> 
The plants rotating on the clinostat continue to grow forward horizontally.<br> 
The gravitational pull affects the plants attached to the clinostat evenly, so no geotropic curvature occurs.<br> 
Shoots show negative geotropism.<br> 
They grow against the pull of the gravitational field.<br> 
Roots show positive geotropism.<br> 
They grow towards the direction of the gravitational pull.<br> 
Leaves show diageotropism (diagravitropism), i.e. orientation at right angles to the vertical in response to gravity.<br> 
4. Soak broad bean seeds in water overnight then
 sow them in flower pots filled with damp sawdust.<br> 
 Make a lid for a wide neck jar with cardboard or cork and insert long 
pins through the lid.<br> 
 Put water in the jar.<br> 
 When radicles of broad bean seeds are 1 cm long, fix seedlings to the pins inside the jar, with radicles pointing in different directions.<br> 
 Select seedlings with straight radicles and fix them clear of the water in the jar.<br> 
 Observe positive geotropic curvatures in the radicles.<br> 
5. Fill a flowerpot and a culture pot of a clinostat
 with sawdust and put 10 bean sprouts with 1 cm roots in each pot.<br> 
 When the seedlings break through, put the clinostat on a window sill so
that its disc is vertical.<br> 
 Attach the culture pot with the bean plants to the disc and switch on 
the clinostat.<br> 
 Put the flowerpot with the bean plants in the wooden holder on its side 
 next to the clinostat.<br> 
 After a few days the bean plants in the flowerpot have become curved while
growing and their shoots point upwards.<br> 
 The plants rotating on the clinostat continue to grow forward horizontally.<br> 
 The shoots are negatively geotropic.<br> 
 They grow against the pull of the gravitational field.<br> 
 However, the roots behave in a positively geotropic manner.<br> 
 They grow towards the direction of the gravitational pull.<br> 
 This behaviour is independent of the orientation of the air and the soil.<br> 
 The gravitational pull affects the plants attached to the clinostat evenly, 
so no geotropic curvature can occur.<br> 
6. Use a clinostat to show that geotropic responses
 are no longer shown if roots and shoots are placed horizontally and slowly 
 revolved about their long axes.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.4.7H">9.4.7</a> Geotropism responses 
 in soaked seeds<br>
 Use any small seedlings, e.g. rapid-cycling <i>Brassica rapa</i> (fast
 plants), <i>Sinapis alba</i> (white mustard), <i>Raphanus sativus</i> (radish).<br> 
 The seedlings should have straight hypocotyls.<br> 
1. Soak broad bean seeds in water overnight and
 sow with the hilum downwards in sand or sawdust.<br> 
 Use a wide-necked glass jar, half fill with water, and close the top with a cork or a piece of cardboard.<br> 
 Insert several long blanket pins through the latter.<br> 
 When the radicles have attained a length of about half an inch, fix several
seedlings to the pins inside the jar, with the radicles pointing in 
 various directions.<br> 
 Seedlings with straight radicles should be selected, and they should be
fixed clear of the water.<br> 
 Place the jar at a temperature of 15<sup>o</sup>C to 25<sup>o</sup>C and
inspect from time to time for positive geotropic curvatures in the radicles.<br> 
2. Arrange 20 radish seeds across the centre of
 a Petri dish and cover the seeds with damp cotton wool.<br> 
 Place four thin strips of clear Sellotape in a square at the edges of 
the Petri dish to hold the cotton wool and seeds in place.<br> 
 Replace the lid of the petri dish.<br> 
 Attach the Petri dish vertically to the wall, with double-sided "Sellotape".<br> 
 Roots appear within 1 to 2 days and seedlings appear within 7 days.<br> 
 For a control, place a similar Petri dish of seeds on the table without
 a lid, in a similar light.<br> 
3. Repeat the experiment by placing a black box
 with no bottom over the Petri dish attached to the wall, but allow a light 
 source to 
 illuminate the seeds directly upwards.<br> 
 Observe whether this light source has affected the direction of growth
 of the seeds.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.4.8H">9.4.8</a> Geotropism responses in shoots<br>
 Use broad bean, <i> Pelargonium</i> (geranium).<br>
 Cut shoots from herbaceous plants and fix in a large test-tube of water 
 with a rubber stopper.<br> 
 Seal the hole in the stopper with wax.<br> 
 Fix the specimen so that the shoot is horizontal, preferably in a fairly 
 warm place where uniform light is provided.<br> 
 Examine periodically for negative geotropic curvature in the stem and 
diageotropic responses in the leaves.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.4.6H">9.4.6</a> Phototropism<br>
<a href="./images/9.125x.gif">See diagram 9.125</a>: Phototropism.<br> 
 1. Cover seedlings growing in pots or a sprouting potato with a black 
box with a hole in one side.<br> 
 Observe the change in direction of growth as the plants turn towards the
light from one side.<br> 
 Repeat the experiment by removing the growing tip from some plants.<br> 
 These plants do not turn towards the light.<br> 
 Repeat the experiment with the hole in the box covered with red, then 
yellow then blue cellophane.<br> 
 Phototropism is caused by increased concentration of the growth hormone
 auxin on the dark side of the growing tip of the shoot.<br> 
 So the plant cells grow more on the shaded side.<br> 
 Plants growing in the dark grow faster than plants growing in the light, but they become etiolated, pale yellow, due to lack of sunlight.<br> 
 Phototropism is more responsive to blue light than any other colour.<br> 
2. Find a plant that grows in the shade and put
 it in a flowerpot.<br> 
 Turn the flowerpot on its side and observe the resulting direction of 
growth of the shoot and the leaves.<br> 
 The shoot turns towards the light and the leaves turn to be at right angles
to the source of light.<br> 
 Leaves are diaphototropic, orientated at right angles to the vertical 
in response to light.<br> 
3. Demonstrate phototropic response of seedlings of mustard, wheat, barley, with uniform illumination.<br> 
 When the seedlings have grown to 5 cm, place the pots under a box or black cloth so that light reaches the shoots from one side.<br> 
4. Place the plants in a darkroom about 60 cm to
 the side of a 40 watt lamp.<br> 
 Note the time taken for positive phototropic curvature to appear.<br> 
Instances of diaphototropic responses in leaves
 can be found in plants grown in living rooms or against the wall.<br> 
 5. Grow plants, e.g.<i> Pelargonium</i> (geranium), in uniform light 
partly screened with a black cloth so that light now reaches it from the 
 side.<br> 
 In a few hours time the leaves begin to adjust their position.<br> 
 A positive response will also develop in the stem.<br> 
6. Plant seeds that grow rapidly, e.g. oats, radish, 
 bean or mustard seeds, in two flowerpots.<br> 
 When the seedlings are 2.5 cm high, cover one pot with a box that has 
a hole cut near the top.<br> 
 From time to time lift the box and observe the direction of growth.<br> 
 Turn the box so that light comes from a different direction and observe
 again after a few days.<br> 
7. Observe plants that turn towards the sun, e.g.
 sunflower.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.4.9H">9.4.9</a> Sprouting potato tuber<br>
<a href="./images/9.85.gif">See diagram 9.85</a>: Sprouting potato tuber.<br> 
 1. Put two light baffles in a long, narrow box and cut a hole in the end.<br> 
 Plant a sprouting potato in a small pot that will fit in the box.<br> 
 Put the pot behind the baffle farthest from the hole.<br> 
 Cover the box and put near a window.<br> 
 Observe the direction of growth from time to time.<br> 
2. Plant some fast growing seeds in four flowerpots.<br> 
 Keep the pots in a darkened room until the seedlings are 2.5 cm high.<br> 
 Put one pot near a sunny window and observe the effect.<br> 
 Turn the plants away from the light and observe.<br> 
 Leave the pot in a place away from direct light for a few days and observe 
 the results.<br> 
3. Put each of the three remaining pots of seedlings
 in a different box.<br> 
 Cut a window in each box and cover each window with a different colour 
of cellophane, red, yellow and blue.<br> 
 Put the three boxes containing the pots of seedlings in good light with 
 the window facing the light.<br> 
 Observe any difference in the effect produced by different coloured light

The swelling of biological material is caused by molecules of water penetrating between the carbohydrate chains, cellulose, starch, or molecules of protein, forming aqueous films.<br> 
As a result of this process the molecules or groups of molecules, the micelles, which are stored without much space between them before swelling, are forced apart.<br> 
Infiltration of water, and with it swelling, takes place predominantly in a vertical direction to the longitudinal axis of the micelle.<br> 
If the structure of a micelle, consisting of strongly bound layers of a membrane, differs, then the direction of the greatest swelling between these layers is different.<br> 
As soon as the swelling changes in shape, curvature must occur.<br> 
Swelling movements of this kind play a role in the dispersal of seeds and spores.<br> 
Experiments<br>
<a href="./images/9.50.1.gif">See diagram 9.50.1</a>: Swelling movements.<br>
1. Cut strips 15 cm long and 3 cm wide from a sheet of writing paper.<br> 
Using a soluble adhesive each of the strips is smeared over its whole surface and they are then bonded together as follows: strip a on strip b, strip c on strip d and strip e on strip f, the double strips obtained in this way are dried, using forceps, at a suitable height over a Bunsen burner flame.<br> 
The double strip e / f turns into a corkscrew.<br> 
Double strip c / d bends into a circle.<br> 
Double strip a / b remains unaltered.<br> 
When manufacturing paper, most of the cellulose fibres end up mainly facing in one direction after the milling process to make large pieces.<br> 
Because a soluble adhesive is used to bond the paper strips together, water penetrates between the fibres and leads to swelling, mainly vertically to the direction in which the fibres run, double strips c /d and e / f, where the direction of the fibres in the individual strips differs, both resemble a biological membrane consisting of two layers of different micellar structure, on drying, shrinkage, these strips 
 must warp.<br> 
2. Plants have special mechanisms for the widest possible dissemination of their seeds and these mechanisms for seed dissemination have adapted to different conditions.<br> 
 Put an open dry pine cone in a 250 mL beaker, filled with water.<br> 
 By next morning, the cone has closed.<br> 
 If it is taken out of the water, the scales reopen again when it dries.<br> 
 Put the closed cone in a warm place, in the sun or on the radiator.<br> 
 As it dries, the cone opens again.<br> 
 The scales that cover the cones are composed of two layers that swell at different rates when exposed to moisture.<br> 
 In this way, "swelling movements" occur.<br> 
 In dry weather, when conditions are favourable for widespread dissemination of the seeds, the cones open.<br> 
 The seeds can fall out and be carried away by the wind.<br> 
 During wet or damp weather the cones close, because the released seeds would stick to the moist soil close to the street and could not be disseminated by the wind.<br> 
 Pull a seed out of an open pine or spruce cone with sharp forceps.<br> 
 Each seed has a large, thin, membrane-like appendage, called a "wing".<br> 
 It increases the capacity for flight of the seed.<br>

<a href="./topics/topic18a.html#18.7.15H">18.7.15</a> Algicides, control of algae 
 in swimming pools<br>
 In swimming pools a copper-based algicide (algae killer) may be used to
controls algae, because the copper ion, Cu<sup>2+</sup> is a very 
 effective algicide.<br> 
 A concentration of 0.03 to 1.0 mg / L (0.03 to 1.0 ppm) of free copper 
ion is needed.<br> 
 The algicide must contain "free" copper, because "bound" copper, in an 
insoluble form, does not work.<br> 
 A concentration in excess of a continuous level of 1.0 ppm is wasteful 
and may damage surfaces and equipment.<br> 
 Although copper is toxic to algae at high concentration it is an essential 
 micronutrient for algae at very low concentrations.<br> 
 Non-copper based algicides may contain the disinfectant benzalkonium chloride, 
also present in Dettol.<br> 
 1. Test the growth of algae in solutions with different copper ion concentrations 
 from 0 to 1 ppm.<br> 
 Measure the amount of algae by measuring the depth at which you can just
see a black cross appear or disappear, like the Secchi Disk 
 method for turbidity, or use a simple nephelometer tube.<br>

 Copper ions at concentration 0.05 mg / L (0.05 ppm) of depress cell division
and photosynthesis in common freshwater green alga, 
 e.g. <i>Chlorella pyrenoidosa</i>.<br> 
 Copper (II) sulfate pentahydrate, CuSO4.5H2O, has
 a molar mass of 249.5 g / mol.<br> 
 Copper has a molar mass of 63.5 g / mol.<br> 
 To make a 1000 mg / L of Cu<sup>2+</sup> solution (1000 ppm), weigh out
249.5/63.5 = 3.929 g of copper (II) sulfate pentahydrate per litre of 
 distilled water or deionized water.<br> 
 Use this solution to prepare serial dilutions (1:10) to reduce this concentration
to 100, 10, 1, 0.1 ppm Cu<sup>2+</sup>.<br> 
 Use a fluorescent tube of colour temperature 6500 K whiteness of colour.<br> 
See: <a href="./physics/UNPh23.html#23.8.21H">23.8.21</a> Colour temperature.<br> 
2. Effect of pH on the toxicity of copper<br>
 At pH below 7.0, the toxicity of copper is greatly enhanced.<br> 
 Prepare solutions of desired pH by diluting some 0.1 M hydrochloric acid
(pH 1).<br> 
 Add standard copper solution to produce a 1 ppm concentration of copper.<br> 
3. Effect of other metals on the toxicity of a
copper algicide<br>
 Toxicity of ionic copper on algal growth is reduced by trivalent (3+) 
metal ions, including those of Mn, Co, Al, Fe and Cr.<br> 
 They form a layer of metal (III) hydroxide around the algal cell, adsorb 
 copper and reduce the penetration of copper into the cell.<br> 
 The degree of insolubility of the metal (III) hydroxide is related to 
its ability to protect against copper toxicity.<br> 
 Test different metals while keeping the Cu<sup>2+</sup> concentration 
the same.<br> 
4. Effect of availability of copper on the toxicity
 of a copper algicide<br>
 The two types of algicides sold are 1. ionic copper, a 5% CuSO4 
solution (5 g copper (II) sulfate / 100 mL) and 2. chelated 
 copper (about 7% Cu).<br> 
 Chelated copper such as copper alkanolamine complex is more toxic to algae
than ionic copper, because both the metal and the 
 organic ligand enter the algae cell.<br> 
 Also, chelated copper is more resistant to changes in pH.<br> 
 Test the algicide ability of both forms of algicide at the same concentration 
 of Cu<sup>2+</sup>, and compare them at different pH.<br> 
 Chelated copper remains active algicide for several weeks whereas copper
 (II) sulfate remains active only for a few days.<br> 
 If pool water contains a high concentration of carbonate ions, so the 
copper ions in copper (II) sulfate will react quickly with the carbonate 
 ions and form an insoluble precipitate of copper carbonate.<br>

 According to the variety of vegetables and the size of plant regulate 
the distance between every layer trough.<br> 
 The end of the plastic trough inclines faintly and slopes criss-cross

 The lower end has the drain hole to drop culture solution, or divert through
the thin plastic pipes, into the next layer trough.<br> 
 In the end, culture solution is dropped can be used repeatedly when the
plastic bucket is retrieved.<br> 
 You can invert over the highest trough a plastic flat bucket whose capacity

 To control the velocity at which culture solution moves into the upper 
trough with the thin pipes and the regulating knob.<br> 
 The advantage of the way of the stereoscopic culture is that it does not
take up much land to use space enough, after vegetables grow, 
 it may keep out the burning sun in the summer.<br> 
 So the plant can give out oxygen to purify the air in the day and let 
off carbon dioxide to reduce the respiratory consumption in the night.<br> 
 You can open the window when the temperature is not low, and, because this
way need not be controlled by electrical machinery and 
 water pumps, managing it is easy.<br>

 Epigeal germination means that these seeds germinate with the cotyledons 
 expanding above ground as the first green leaves, seed leaves.<br> 
 The food supply for the growth of the embryo is stored in the cotyledons.<br> 
 The embryo root, the radicle, emerges through the micropyle and grows 
down due to geotropism (growth repositioning in response to 
 gravity) to form a tap root and lateral roots.<br> 
 The seedling stem, hypocotyl, the part of the axis below the attachment
 of the cotyledons, but above the radicle, emerges from the seed 
 coats by elongating and bending.<br> 
 Then it straightens to carry the seed above the surface of the soil.<br> 
 When the food reserves are exhausted, the seed coats drop off leaving 
the cotyledons to spread out horizontally each side of the 
 plumule, turn green and function as the first leaves, seed leaves.<br> 
 Later the plumule grows to become the shoot and form leaves and the cotyledons
drop off leaving cotyledon scars on the stem.<br>

 Examine the specimen of an early stage of this dicotyledon.<br> 
 It is an example of a seed where the food supply for the growth of the 
embryo is stored in a nutritive tissue called endosperm, and the 
 membranous cotyledons come above ground during germination and function 
 as the first pair of leaves.<br> 
 This is accomplished by the elongation of the hypocotyl, the part of the
axis below the attachment of the cotyledons, but above the radicle.<br>

 Eventually they will die and decompose.<br> 
2. Take two pieces of foam rubber small enough
to float freely in a preparation glass, 150 mm tall and diameter 80 mm.<br>

 of thin string through each hole.<br> 
 Attach each piece of foam rubber by means of the string and a strip of
sticking plaster to the lower side of the lids of the preparation 
 glass.<br> 
 With the lid in place the pieces of foam rubber should hang halfway down
in the glasses.<br> 
 Put 100 mL water into one of the preparation glasses and 50 mL 20% pyrogallol 
 and 20% sodium hydroxide solution in the other, to 
 absorb the oxygen, the pieces of foam rubber are well soaked with water, 
 on each put 15 unswollen garden cress, seeds, smear the 
 rim of the preparation glasses with glycerine to aid sealing and then 
put the lids in place with the foam rubber pieces hanging down.<br> 
 The pieces of foam rubber with the cress seeds should not come into contact
with the fluids underneath them.<br> 
 Leave the preparation glasses to stand at room temperature.<br> 
 Within 2 days the cress seeds in the preparation glass with water have 
germinated, they have developed into small plants.<br> 
 The cress seeds in the preparation glass with the pyrogallol sodium hydroxide
solution, however, have not germinated.<br> 
 The pea seeds that were completely covered with water, experiment 1, could
not come into direct contact with the air.<br> 
 They suffered from lack of oxygen, and germination could not take place.<br> 
 Experiment 2 shows that oxygen is the determining factor.<br> 
3. Investigate whether germinating seeds need air

 Label each dish and leave them in the classroom.<br> 
 Cover the dishes to make exchange of air possible.<br> 
 Keep adding water to dish B to ensure that the surface of the water is
always a few millimetres above the beans.<br> 
 By the following day, the beans in dish A, which was not filled to the

still only swollen with no further change.<br> 
 Seeds need air (oxygen) and water for germination.<br> 
 However, the beans in dish B that were completely covered with water had

 Note which seeds show that germination is promoted by light, hindered 
by light or are indifferent to light.<br> 
 Such seeds are called "light germinators", "dark germinators" and "seeds 
 unaffected by light".<br> 
 The germination of many plant seeds is not affected by light.<br> 
 Some seeds, however, can only germinate if they are exposed in their swollen
condition for some length of time to light, while the 
 germination of others is prevented by exposure to light.<br> 
 So plants may be light germinators or dark germinators.<br> 
2. To examine the effect of light on seeds, set
 up saucers containing seeds, but having duplicate sets.<br> 
 Place one set in the light and another set in a dark room or box.<br> 
 Do the same with examples of light hard and light-sensitive seeds.<br> 
 Record the results as percentages, and from them discuss the effect of

<a href="./images/9.3.49.gif">See diagram 9.3.49</a>: Germination test.<br> 
Experiments<br>
 1. Use a dish with absorbent paper in the bottom and another dish containing 
 dry, finely divided garden soil.<br> 
 Put 10 dry beans in each dish.<br> 
 Fill the first dish with tap water until the beans are just covered.<br> 
 Leave the dishes to stand at room temperature.<br> 
 Within 24 hours only the beans covered with tap water have swollen considerably 
 and have absorbed much water.<br> 
 Most beans germinate after two days.<br> 
 The beans in the other dish have not changed.<br> 
 2. Seeds absorb water through the surface of the
 seed coats and through their micropyle.<br> 
 Weigh 10 dry bean seeds, then block their micropyles with collodion or
rubber solution, e.g. the solution used to stick soles on shoes.<br> 
 Be careful! Rubber solution can be toxic when inhaled so work in a fume 
 cupboard, fume hood.<br> 
 Leave the solution to dry then put the seeds in water.<br> 
 Compare the weight and volume of the treated seeds with untreated seeds.<br> 
 3. Half fill measuring cylinders and add equal
volumes of seeds, e.g. pea, common green bean and broad bean.<br> 
 Observe the swelling seeds and calculate how much water they absorb.<br> 
 At first, water is absorbed by imbibition through the seed coats that 
swell and wrinkle.<br> 
 Then water passes through the micropyle causing the embryo to swell inside
the seed coats and make them smooth again.<br> 
 Starch food reserves are hydrolysed to glucose sugar to enable the embryo 
 to grow first by cell enlargement then by cell division.<br> 
 Later growth occurs mainly at the two meristems:<br>
 3.1 The dividing cells in the embryo shoot, plumule.<br> 
 3.2 The dividing cells in the embryo root.<br> 
4. Seeds can only germinate when they absorb water
 and swell.<br> 
 Take two flat glass dishes and put a circular filter into each, a third 
 dish is filled almost up to the edge with completely dry, 
 finely-divided garden soil.<br> 
 Put 15 to 20 dry pea seeds in each of the dishes.<br> 
 In the dish filled with soil they should project only a little above the
soil, one of the other dishes is filled with water until the pea seeds 
 are just covered.<br> 
 All three dishes are then left to stand at room temperature with the lid
placed on them obliquely, to allow exchange of air.<br> 
 Within 24 hours the pea seeds covered with water have swollen considerably.<br> 
 They have absorbed a lot of the water.<br> 
 After a further 1 to 2 days they have almost all germinated, the pea seeds
in the other two flat glass dishes on dry filter paper and in dry 
 garden soil have not changed.<br> 
 Seeds only germinate after absorbing water and after the resultant swelling.<br> 
 Dry seeds cannot germinate whether they are in open air or in dry soil.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.121H">9.121</a> Germination and temperature<br>

2. Place a piece of absorbent paper or cotton wool
 in a saucer.<br> 
 Thoroughly moisten it with water.<br> 
 On this absorbent paper, sow a hundred wheat grains.<br> 
 Do the same with other seeds, preferably garden seeds, e.g. cress (garden 
 cress), radish, onion, beet, carrot.<br> 
 Each day record the number that have germinated and calculate the percentage.<br> 
 More water may be added to keep the absorbent paper moist.<br> 
 Note the diversity of time taken to germinate.<br> 
3. Fold 1 m<sup>2</sup> muslin twice in the same
 direction.<br> 
 Near one end mark out with a pencil 8 or 10 squares 5 × 5 cm.<br> 
 Number the squares, and on each square place ten seeds from a particular 
 packet.<br> 
 Note the arrangement of the different seeds.<br> 
 Fold the opposite end of the muslin over the seeds.<br> 
 Roll up the tester and tie it loosely with string.<br> 
 Saturate the rest with water.<br> 
 Keep it moist and in a warm place for several days.<br> 
 The unroll it and see how many of each kind of seeds have germinated.<br> 
 Report the viability as a percentage or by constructing graphs.<br>

 in germinating pollen, pollen tube<br>
<a href="./images/9.123.gif">See diagram 9.123</a>: Germinating pollen grain.<br> 
 A tropism is a response affected by the direction of the origin of the 
stimulus.<br> 
 For example, geotropism is a response to gravity and in the direction 
of gravity.<br> 
Experiments<br>
 1. Shake fresh pollen from several kinds of flowers on absorbent paper
 soaked in a 10% sugar solution.<br> 
 Put a cover over the pollen and leave it for 12 hours.<br> 
 Use a magnifying glass to see little tubes growing from the pollen grains, 
 the pollen tubes.<br> 
 Shake fresh pollen from flowers onto stigmas of the same kind of flower
 and look for germinating pollen on the stigmas.<br> 
 Observe pollen stained with methylene blue under low power.<br> 
2. Dissolve 2.5 g of sucrose and 1 g of gelatine
 in 50 mL of demineralized water in a beaker.<br> 
 Put one drop of the solution to a microscope slide.<br> 
 Cut a piece of stigma or style from a female marrow flower and squash 
it in the drop on the microscope slide.<br> 
 Pick some mature stamens and cut the anthers over the drop so that the 
pollen falls near the squashed piece of stigma or style.<br> 
 Keep the microscope slide in a damp place and examine it the next day.<br> 
 Note the pollen grains that have germinated to form pollen tubes.<br> 
 Most of the pollen tubes are growing towards the squashed stigma or style.<br> 
 The pollen tubes respond to a chemical that diffuses into the sugar gelatine
from the female parts of the flower.<br> 
 In a similar way, the pollen tube would normally grow down the style to
reach the ovary and fertilize the ovule.<br> 
 Be careful! Do not break the coverslip, because the broken pieces are very
sharp and dangerous.<br>

 nastic movements<br>
<a href="./images/9.126.gif">See diagram 9.126</a>: Thermonastic movement of daisy, e.g. four o'clock flower, crocus, tulip<br>
 A nastic movement is a response not affected by the direction of origin
 of the stimulus.<br> 
 Movements made in response to a stimulus, tropic movements, where the 
direction of the movement is not controlled by the stimulus, 
 are called nastic movements.<br> 
 These stimuli often consist only of a general change in some external 
factors, temperature, light.<br> 
 A thermonastic response is movements caused by temperature changes, e.g.
opening and closing of flowers.<br> 
 In addition to temperature and light, the diurnal rhythm of the plant 
and other autonomic stimuli may control the opening and closing of 
 flowers.<br> 
 The "four o'clock flower", does not close its flowers, because the time 
is four o'clock, but because of drop in temperature.<br> 
Experiments<br>
 1. Transplant two flowering plants with many petals, e.g. daisy, to two
tubes containing water.<br> 
 Put one tube in a beaker of cold water and the other tube in a beaker 
of warm water.<br> 
 After 30 minutes the flower in the beaker containing warm water has opened
further, but the flower in the beaker containing cold water 
 has closed.<br> 
2. Half fill two beakers with water.<br> 
 Heat the water in one beaker to 30<sup>o</sup>C.<br> 
 Fill two collecting tubes to a height of 2 cm with water.<br> 
 Put one daisy with half opened petals in each collecting tube and put 
the tubes in the beakers containing warm and cold water.<br> 
 The tubes must float so use glass beads to balance the tubes.<br> 
 Observe the behaviour of the petals.<br> 
 After 30 minutes the flower in the beaker containing warm water has opened 
 further, but the flower in the beaker containing cold water 
 has closed.<br> 
 The different temperatures cause a differing degree of expansion in the
upper and lower side of the petals, which causes thermonastic 
 movements.<br> 
 In addition to temperature and light, the diurnal rhythm of the plant 
and other autonomic stimuli play a role in opening and closing flowers.<br> 
3. If you bring flowers in the closed condition
 into the warm laboratory, opening usually commences promptly even if the 
 flowers are 
 placed in a dark cupboard.<br> 
 The movements are reversed if you put the specimens into a refrigerator.<br> 
 Use daisy or dandelion flowers to illustrate the photonastic properties
 of these flowers.<br> 
 They may be performed outdoors or daisy plants can be transplanted into 
 pots in the greenhouse.<br> 
 If certain plants are covered over with a box in the afternoon, examination 
 next day will show that at a time when exposed plants have 
 opened their flowers, the flowers in darkness are still closed.<br> 
 The sleep movements of leaves should be studied in suitable examples in
the garden and field.<br>

 plants<br>
 1. The growing tip of a stem does not grow directly vertically, but moves 
 upwards in a helical path, but there is a difference in the 
 magnitude of the winding movement, circumnutation, in shrubs and twining
 climbers.<br> 
 The direction of winding is under genetic control of a microtubule protein, 
 tubulin, in the cells.<br> 
 Most plants exhibit circumnutation, the irregular spiral or elliptical 
rotation of the apex of a growing stem, root, or shoot.<br> 
 The difference is caused by caused by differences in the rate of growth
 of the opposite sides.<br> 
 However, winding plants show extreme circumnutation.<br> 
 Shoot circumnutation is controlled by gravity-sensing plant cells.<br> 
 Inflorescence stems of thale cress may show differences in circumnutation 
 that follows a circadian rhythm.<br> 
Experiments<br> 
2. Investigate the environmental factors that affect
 this movement, e.g. light and darkness, wind.<br> 
 Investigate whether phototropism can affect the experiment.<br> 
3. Place a piece of vertical fencing wire in the
 path of a twining stem of leaf tendril and note the subsequent movement.<br> 
4. Mount a sheet of glass 10 cm above the plant
 than line up the apex with a spot on the glass.<br> 
 Observe the plant every few hours to get a record of the plant movement.<br> 
5. Investigate whether a twining plant can climb
 around supports of different sizes.<br> 
 Find the critical cylinder radius above which a plant can no longer twine.<br> 
6. Examine clockwise winding plants (CW):<br>
* Hops, <i>Humulus</i>, Cannabaceae<br>
* Honeysuckle, <i>Lonicera</i>, Caprifoliaceae<br>
 Examine counter clockwise winding plants (CCW).<br>
* Morning glory, <i>Ipomoea</i>, Convolvulaceae<br>
* <i> Wisteria</i>, Fabaceae<br>
 Uncoil them from their support and recurl them in the opposite direction 
 to see if they can change direction of winding.<br> 

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.128H">9.128</a> Heliotropism of sunflowers<br>
by Gregory Moore, Doctor of Botany, The University of Melbourne, (edited for this website)<br>
Many of us probably first got to know of heliotropism by watching the enormous yellow and black flowering heads of aptly name sunflowers, which moved as they grew.<br> 
These flowers track the course of the sun spectacularly on warm and sunny, spring or summer days.<br> 
Sometimes they move through an arc of almost 180⁰ from morning to evening.<br> 
The mechanics of tracking the sun.<br> 
A number flowering species display heliotropism, including alpine buttercups, arctic poppies, alfalfa, soybean and many of the daisy-type species.<br> 
This is Heliotropium arborescens, named for its heliotropism.<br> 
They were very popular in gardens a century or more ago, but have fallen from favour as they can be poisonous and weedy.<br> 
Flowers are really in the advertising game and will do anything they can to attract a suitable pollinator, as effectively and as efficiently as they can.<br> 
There are several possible reasons why tracking the sun might have evolved to achieve more successful pollination.<br> 
By tracking the sun, flowers absorb more solar radiation and so remain warmer.<br> 
The warmer temperature suits or even rewards insect pollinators that are more active when they have a higher body temperature.<br> 
Optimum flower warmth may also boost pollen development and germination, leading to a higher fertilisation rate and more seeds.<br> 
For many heliotropic flowering species, there’s a special layer of cells called the pulvinus just under the flower heads.<br> 
These cells pump water across their cell membranes in a controlled way, so that cells can be fully pumped up like a balloon or become empty and flaccid.<br> 
Changes in these cells allow the flower head to move.<br> 
In 2016, scientists discovered that the sunflower movement is due to significantly different growth rates on opposite sides of the flowering stem.<br> 
Sunflowers move differently to other heliotropic flowers.<br> 
On the east-facing side, the cells grow and elongate quickly during the day, which slowly pushes the flower to face west as the daylight hours go by — following the sun.<br> 
At night the west-side cells grow and elongate more rapidly, which pushes the flower back toward the east over night.<br> 
Everything is then set for the whole process to begin again at dawn next day, which is repeated daily until the flower stops growing and movement ceases.<br>
