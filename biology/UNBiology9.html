<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.1H">9.1.</a> Viruses<br>
Viruses are minute infectious agents whose genomes are composed of DNA or RNA, but not both.<br> 
They lack independent metabolism and cannot replicate outside living host cells, so they must infect the cells of other types of organisms to reproduce.<br> 
Most viruses are capable of passing through fine filters that retain bacteria, but are not visible through a light microscope.<br>
1. A viruses consists of two parts, genetic material, DNA or RNA, in a coat of protein.<br>
The nucleic acid in the virus contains instructions for the cell to make new viruses.<br>
A virus is a submicroscopic infectious agent that replication inside a cell by using the cell's own biochemical processes.<br>
 Viruses cause infected cells to produce progeny viruses.<br>
 Retroviruses use the enzyme reverse transcriptase to copy the viral RNA into DNA.<br>
 Viruses are not affected by antibiotics.<br>
 To transduce a cell is to transfer genetic material from another cell to that cell, another usually by a virus particle or a virus.<br>
<br> 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.2H">9.2</a> Virus classification<br>
The classification of viruses can be based on the type and arrangement of the genetic material.<br>

<a href="../images/9.3.70.gif">See diagram 9.3.70</a>: T4 bacteriophage that attacks E. coli.<br>
A bacteriophage or "phage" is a very small virus that infects bacteria.<br>
The T4 bacteriophage infects the bacterium Escherichia coli, (E.coli), found in the human gut.<br>
This infection is used to study viruses and how they infect and replicate inside cells.<br>
T-phages have head, capsid, containing double-stranded DNA genetic material.<br>
The tail of the bacteriophage includes the tail, sheath, base plate and tail fibres, made of different proteins, used to attach itself to the bacterium.<br>
The phage then inserts its own genetic material inside of the host bacterial cell so that it replicates and make more bacteriophages.<br>

<a href="https://www.coronavirus.gov/">COVID-19 virus</a> Centres for Disease Control and Prevention<br>
<a href="https://www.nih.gov/">CORONAVIRUS</a> National Institutes of Health<br>
Coronaviruses are a big group of viruses that cause illnesses, e.g. common cold or diseases including SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS.<br>
COVID-19, (Corona Virus Disease 19), is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans.<br>
The viruses are named for the corona, or crown, of surface proteins that the virus uses to penetrate the cells of its host.<br>
Coronavirus disease 2019<br>
(COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, (SARS-CoV-2).<br>
The disease had spread globally by 13/03/2020, since 2019, resulting in the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic.<br>
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.<br>
Muscle pain, sputum production and sore throat are some of the less common symptoms.<br>
While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to pneumonia and multi-organ failure.<br>
The case fatality rate is estimated at between 1% and 5%, but varies by age and other health conditions.<br>
<br>
<hr width="100%" size="2"> "Kill Coronavirus by washing your hands with soap"<br>
Based on article by Palli Thordarson, Professor of Chemistry, University of New South Wales.<br>
Viruses can be active outside the body for hours, even days.<br>
Disinfectants, liquids, wipes, gels and creams containing alcohol are all useful at getting rid of them, but they are not quite as good as normal soap.<br>
Health authorities have been giving us two messages:<br>
1. When you have the virus there are no drugs that can kill it or help you get rid of it.<br>
2. Wash your hands to stop the virus spreading.<br>
Why does soap work so well on the Coronavirus, and indeed most viruses?<br>
Because the virus is a self-assembled nanoparticle in which the weakest link is the lipid (fatty) bilayer.<br>
Soap dissolves the fat membrane and the virus falls apart and dies, or rather, we should say it becomes inactive as viruses aren’t really alive.<br>
Most viruses consist of three key building blocks: RNA, proteins and lipids.<br>
A virus-infected cell makes lots of these building blocks, which then spontaneously self-assemble to form the virus.<br>
There are no strong covalent bonds holding these units together, so you do not necessarily need harsh chemicals to split those units apart.<br>
When an infected cell dies, all these new viruses escape and go on to infect other cells.<br>
Some end up also in the airways of lungs.<br>
When you cough, or especially when you sneeze, tiny droplets from the airways can fly up to 10 metres.<br>
The droplets are thought to be the main Coronavirus carriers and they can go at least two metres.<br>
These tiny droplets end on surfaces and often dry out quickly, but the viruses remain active.<br>
Human skin is an ideal surface for a virus, because it is “organic” and the proteins and fatty acids in the dead cells on the surface interact with the virus.<br>
When you touch, say, a steel surface with a virus particle on it, it will stick to your skin and hence get transferred on to your hands.<br>
If you then touch your face, especially your eyes, nostrils or mouth, you can get infected, and most people touch their face once every two to five minutes.<br>
Washing the virus off with water alone might work, but water is not good at competing with the strong, glue-like interactions between the skin and the virus.<br>
Soapy water is different, because it contains fat-like substances, amphiphiles, some of which are structurally similar to the lipids in the virus membrane.<br>
An amphiphile chemical compound, (Greek <i>amphis</i>, and <i>philia</i> both 'love'), has both hydrophilic (water-loving) and lipophilic (fat-loving) properties.<br>
The soap molecules “compete” with the lipids in the virus membrane, which is similar to how soap also removes normal dirt from the skin.<br>
The soap not only loosens the “glue” between the virus and the skin, but also the Velcro-like interactions that hold the proteins, lipids and RNA in the virus together.<br>
Coronavirus hits ill and disabled people hardest.<br>
Alcohol-based products, including most “disinfectant” products, contain typically 60-80% ethanol, and kill viruses in a similar fashion.<br>
But soap is better, because you only need a fairly small amount of soapy water, which, with rubbing, covers your entire hand easily.<br>
Whereas you need to literally soak the virus in ethanol for a brief moment, and wipes or rubbing a gel on the hands does not guarantee that you soak every corner of the skin on your hands effectively enough.<br>
Soap is the best, but do use alcohol-based sanitisers, when soap is not handy or practical.<br>
<br> 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.6H">9.6</a> Herpes, genital herpes, genital ulcers<br>
 Genital herpes is caused by herpes viruses.<br>
 Encephalitis, caused by the Herpes Simplex virus, causes headache, fever, inflammation of the brain, carried by mosquitoes, eastern equine encephalitis is fatal.<br>
 The herpes simplex virus can cause "cold sores" if the mouth is infected or genital ulcers if the sexual organs are infected.<br>
 The symptoms include clusters of small painful blisters that become ulcers then in two weeks.<br>
 People infected with the herpes virus may never develop any symptoms and so remain unaware of the infection.<br>
 The first infection of genital herpes has usually the worst symptoms.<br>
 The symptoms may recur when people are tired or tense or never recur.<br>
 If a person has genital herpes, the virus in specific nerve cells can pass on by sexual contact, even if the infected person does not have herpes blisters or ulcers.<br>
 There is no cure for herpes. but it can be managed to ease the symptoms by bathing the sores in saltwater.<br>
 An ice block wrapped in a towel may stop blisters forming.<br>
 A viral STD, herpes, in two common strains, HSV1 and HSV2. HSV1 is the herpes cold sore virus, a variety that is common to see around the mouth,
 HSV2 is most often associated with genital sores.<br>
 Symptoms: Collection of small white bumps clumped on the external genitalia, or in the pubic region.<br>
 Single large puss-like pustules may form along with scabbing over of the infected area.<br>
 Treatment: Herpes is treated with antiviral drugs, but the virus cannot be cured.<br>
 People with the herpes virus need to know that they can transmit the virus even when they do not have any sores or other symptoms.<br>
 The virus lives in the nerve endings, so a reduction in stress and intense rubbing will prevent further outbreaks, and sleep is also a powerful treatment.<br>
HSV-1 (Herpes simplex 1)<br>
 HSV-1, herpes simplex virus causes cold sores, painful blemishes of the mouth (fever blisters).<br>
 It can become dormant for years, when drugs cannot affect it<br>
Years later, it can be revived by excessive sunlight or fever to cause a cold sore in the same place as before.<br>
 HSV-2 (Herpes simplex 2)<br>
 HSV-2 causes painful genital sores that can return late in life as shingles.<br>
 The Herpes varicella-zoster virus causes chicken pox (varicella) in the skin of children as red spots that become small bubbles then become dry crusts.<br>
 In adults, the Herpes varicella-zoster virus causes shingles (zoster) as painful lesions in a pattern along the sensory nerves.<br>

 Hepatitis A is transmitted by the faecal-oral route.<br>
 This may be food- or water-borne or via sexual contact, particularly between men.<br>
 Incubation period: 1550 days (mean 28 days)<br>
 How far back to trace 50 days from onset of symptoms<br>
 Usual testing method: Serology for hepatitis A (Hepatitis A IgM positive<br>
 Common symptoms: Acute hepatitis with jaundice, malaise, abdominal pain, dark urine<br>
 Likelihood of transmission per act of unprotected intercourse: Probably high if any faecal contamination of mouth<br>
 Likelihood of long-term sexual partner being infected: High, if susceptible<br>
 Protective effect of condoms: Nil (transmission is faecal-oral)<br>
 Transmission by oral sex: Possible if faecal contamination is present<br>
 Duration of potential infectivity: Two weeks before the onset of jaundice to one week after<br>
 Important consequences: Rarely, severe hepatitis and acute liver failure<br>
 Direct benefit of detection and treatment of contacts: Passive and active immunization against hepatitis A<br>
 Usual management of contacts: Passive immunization with human immunoglobulin 2.0 mL by intramuscular injection within 2 weeks of exposure.<br>
 Start active vaccination course immediately<br>
 Contact tracing priority: High: including sexual contacts, domestic contacts, close social contacts, and food handlers<br>
 Notification: Acute viral hepatitis A is notifiable by all doctors and laboratories in all Australian states and territories, and New Zealand.<br>
 If locally acquired, telephone a public health unit within 24 hours.<br>

<a href="#5.1.7H">See 5.1.7</a>: Hepatitis B contact tracing, Hepatitis B virus<br>
 This disease is caused by is a virus that affects the liver.<br>
 The virus is spread by blood to blood contact, e.g. sharing needles, or by sexual intercourse, vaginal, oral or anal.<br>
 People who are infected may have no symptoms at all or they may become ill with fever, nausea, dark urine or jaundice, yellow skin and eyes.<br>
 After infection, most adults recover, develop antibodies to the virus and cannot spread the virus to others.<br>
 A few people retain the virus, become carriers, may infect other people, and have an increased risk of developing liver disease.<br>
 A vaccine for Hepatitis B is available.<br>
 It is not effective for Hepatitis B carriers.<br>
 Vaccination for hepatitis B - Getting vaccinated for Hepatitis B is not something that everyone thinks about.<br>

<a href="#5.1.8H">See 5.1.8</a>: Hepatitis C contact tracing, Hepatitis C virus<br>
 This disease is caused by another virus that affects the liver.<br>
 At this stage, there is no test to show whether a person has completely cleared the virus from the body or if the person remains a carrier and can infect others.<br>
 It is suspected that more people remain carriers than with Hepatitis B disease, long-term carriers may develop liver problems years after infection.<br>
 Hepatitis C is spread by blood to blood contact.<br>
 It does not appear to spread easily by sexual contact.<br>
 Currently, it would appear that many patients with Hepatitis C have been infected by sharing needles or other drug using equipment or by infected blood transfusions.<br>
 In some countries, blood is routinely screened for Hepatitis C before transfusion.<br>
 In 2006 there is no vaccine available for Hepatitis C disease.<br>
 People with Hepatitis C disease should be checked by a doctor every few years.<br>
 Significant advances have recently, 2013, been made in the management of hepatitis C virus (HCV).<br>
 These advances include the use of non-invasive methods to assess liver fibrosis, interleukin 28B genotype testing to predict interferon responsiveness
 and the use of new antiviral regimens for HCVgenotype I, using antiviral agents (boceprevir and telaprevir).<br>
 These protease inhibitors are used in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin as triple therapy for genotype I HCV.<br>
 The protease inhibitors are the first of many antiviral drugs to become available to treat HCV, heralding the arrival of new agents that will offer greater chances of cure with improved safety and tolerability
 compared with current therapies.<br>

HIV (Human immunodeficiency virus) AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome)	Opportunistic infections
Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, AIDS<br>
 The acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, AIDS, is a range of medical conditions,
 It is a syndrome, that occurs when a person's immune system is seriously weakened by infection from the human immunodeficiency virus, HIV.<br>
 So there is no such thing as an "AIDS virus".<br>
 HIV is called a retrovirus, because it can change its own RNA genetic material into DNA to cause the host cell's DNA to produce more HIV.<br>
 Blood contains three types of cells, erythrocytes, thrombocytes, and leucocytes.<br>
 Leucocytes, white blood cells, are responsible for the defence of the body against disease.<br>
 One type of white cell, the T-lymphocyte, T-helper cell, is essential for immunity, because it recognizes foreign antigens from its memory of previous infections and alerts other white cells to destroy the foreign 
 antigen.<br>
 HIV attacks the T-helper cells, reproduces inside them and kills them, causing a gradual deterioration of immune functions following the initial HIV infection.<br>
 A person with not enough T-helper cells to respond to infection will become ill and develop AIDS.<br>
 The infected person loses resistance to diseases and may die of opportunistic infections or AIDS-related illnesses, e.g. tuberculosis or bronchitis.<br>
 The opportunistic infections that occur in a person infected with HIV are caused first by destruction of immune defences by the virus and secondly by infections in your everyday environment.<br>
 These infections can often be treated, but there is no successful treatment for the immune deficiency caused by the virus.<br>
<br> 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.8.2H">9.8.2</a> Causes of infection by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)<br>
 HIV is the virus that causes AIDS, and is transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids; semen, vaginal secretions, breast milk and blood.<br>
 Infection can occur from any activity that allows body fluids infected with HIV to enter the bloodstream through a break in the skin, e.g. a cut or open sore.<br>
 Body fluids include blood, menstrual blood, bleeding gums, semen, vaginal secretions, breast milk, amniotic fluid, and pre-ejaculate.<br>
 Infection can occur in the following circumstances:<br>
 1. Unprotected sexual contact with an infected person, i.e. sexual intercourse without using a condom.<br>
 The virus can enter the body through the lining mucosa of the vagina, penis and rectum, especially if these linings are already damaged by STIs that cause ulcers or inflammation.<br>
 2. Using needles and / or syringes drug injections contaminated with minute quantities of blood containing the virus.<br>
 3. Transfusion of infected blood or blood clotting factors.<br>
 This should not occur when blood is properly screened in hospitals for HIV antibodies.<br>
 4. Babies being born to HIV-infected mothers becoming infected before or during birth or through breast feeding.<br>
 5. Cutting the skin without sterilizing between persons, e.g. tattooing, piercing, circumcision, female genital cutting.<br>
 There is no scientific evidence to support transmission of AIDS by mosquitoes, shaking hands, drinking from the same glass, sharing clothes, sitting on toilet seats, swimming, hugging, or looking after AIDS-positive
adults or children living with AIDS.<br>
<br> 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.8.3H">9.8.3</a> Description of infection by HIV<br>
 After infecting a new host, HIV starts rapidly reproducing itself inside the host's cells to produce new viruses that infect additional cells.<br>
 The viral replication may be so intensive that within a month after infection the infected individuals may have 100 million viral copies per mL of blood plasma.<br>
 The first line of natural immune defence is the non-specific immune system consisting of cells that patrol the body to destroy any virus-infected cell they encounter.<br>
 However, in most HIV-infected individuals the non-specific immune system may be overwhelmed by the initial onslaught of replicating HIV.<br>
 However, antigen presenting cells of the non-specific immune system engulf some viral proteins so that they can later show them to more specialized immune system components with the aim of producing a specify response to the HIV.<br>
 The antigen presenting cells include the helper T cells and killer T cells.<br>
 When the killer Y cells have received a description of the infecting virus intruder and a chemical signal from helper T cells, they multiply, then start destroying the infecting virus approximately three weeks after the initial infection.<br>
 The killer T cells do destroy most virus-infected cells and drive down the virus levels.<br>
 However, usually the response is not enough to prevent lifelong chronic infection.<br>
The helper T cells direct the activities of other immune cells, but from the start of the infection, the HIV infects helper T cells themselves to replicate inside them and destroying them.<br>
 The HIV destroys the "memory helper" T cells that hold the immune system's memory of past exposures to pathogens.<br>
 A few weeks after the initial infection, so many memory helper T cells are destroyed that the control of the immune system is destroyed and never fully recovers.<br>
 Meanwhile, the HIV has a method of evading the killer T cells.<br>
 After entering a cell, the HIV copies its RNA genetic material into DNA in an inexact procedure that result in mutations in the viral copy.<br>
 These mutations are passed to the next generation every time the next generation of viruses copy themselves.<br>
 Also, if two viruses infect the same cell, they can swap genetic material by recombination and produce another virus variant for the next generation.<br>
 The increasing genetic diversity of HIV proteins causes them to become increasingly unrecognizable to immune cells that can only remember the original version of the virus.<br>
 As the killer T cells destroy all the cells displaying recognizable antigens, the virus-infected cells carrying mutant proteins take over.<br>
 Similarly, the antibodies produced by the immune system, weeks after the initial infection cannot recognize many of the HIV proteins in the host later in the infection.<br>
 Immune defences are usually unable to recognize variant versions of HIV.<br>
 So even a strong vaccine-evoked memory response against one strain of HIV might be ineffective against the strain that later enters the body or might become useless as the virus mutates.<br>
 HIV mutates so rapidly that the diversity of proteins on the surface of HIV particles in a single person after six years of infection is estimated to be greater than the diversity of all the human flu viruses strains world wide in a given year.<br>
<br> 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.8.4H">9.8.4</a> Diagnosis of HIV/AIDS<br>
 You cannot tell just by looking if someone is infected with HIV, because some HIV positive people can stay healthy and look healthy 
 for many years.<br>
 A person who has the HIV infection has antibodies in the blood to the virus
but may not have developed any of the illnesses of AIDS.<br>
 The only sure way of knowing is to get tested with the ELISA blood tests 
 then confirm the result with the Western blot blood tests.<br>
 Also, saliva tests are used.<br>
 Voluntary testing for HIV before marriage is recommended.<br>
 Antibodies are proteins that attack and remove any foreign organisms and
toxins, antigens, in the blood.<br>
 HIV is an antigen.<br>
 The antibodies produced by HIV infection cannot get rid of it. but the existence
of "marker" antibodies show that HIV infection has 
 occurred.<br>
 Receiving pre-test and post-test counselling is important.<br>
 People may be infected without knowing it and transmit HIV to others during
this time.<br>
 However, the tests that identify the antibodies to HIV usually give a negative
result for the first one to three months after initial infection, 
 called the "window period".<br>
 So a person who has been at risk of recent infection who receives a negative 
 test result should get a repeat of the test after three to four 
 months.<br>
 Counselling should be given before and after the tests to ensure that the
patient understands the implications of either a positive or 
 negative result.<br>
 The doctor should give the test results face-to-face and ensure that all
information about the test remains confidential.<br>
<br> 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.8.5H">9.8.5</a> Symptoms of HIV/AIDS<br>
 Symptoms include fever, fatigue and flu-like symptoms.<br>
 Weight loss and skin rashes along with pneumonia are also common symptoms.<br>
 As the virus continues to attack the immune system, a person will develop symptoms of the disease, e.g. persistent fatigue, swollen lymph glands, rapid weight loss, night sweats, memory loss, persistent diarrhoea.<br>
 When the immune system is severely damaged, certain cancers, infections 
 and brain disorders can occur.<br>
 For example, the appearance of purple blotches on the skin may indicate 
 Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS).<br>
 This stage of the illness is called AIDS.<br>
<br> 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.8.6H">9.8.6</a> Treatment of HIV/AIDS<br>
 In 2022, HIV infection can be treated. but not cured, because the body cannot rid of it.<br>
However, there are many medications, called antiretroviral therapy (ART), that can control HIV and prevent complications.<br>
 There are three types of treatment that can be very effective if early 
diagnosis occurs:<br>
 1. Antiretroviral medication is used to slow the reproduction of the virus
but not cure AIDS.<br>
 There is no such thing as an "AIDS vaccine".<br>
 HIV targets the immune system and it is a retrovirus that can insert itself
into the genetic material, replicate quickly and often mutate.<br>
 The first anti-HIV drug, AZT, was licensed in 1987.<br>
 It inhibits the HIV enzyme reverse transcripts that the virus uses to convert its single strand of RNA into double strand DNA before splicing itself into the genome of the host cell.<br>
 However, the high rate of mutation by the HIV virus allowed resistance to the drug to develop.<br>
 So medical researchers developed many other "antiretroviral" drugs to be taken in different combinations, e.g. Lamivudine, Viread and Ziagen.<br>
 Other types of anti-HIV drugs are the following:<br>
 1.1 Fusion inhibitors (entry inhibitors), e.g. Enfuvirtide, that interferes with the HIV ability to enter cells.<br>
 1.2 Integrase inhibitors, e.g. Raltegravir, that block the enzyme integrase that the HIV virus uses to integrate its genetic material into the host cell's DNA.<br>
 1.3 Maturation inhibitors, e.g. Bevirimat, that block replication of the HIV virus.<br>
 HIV positive patients living in countries where these drugs are available and who have a healthy lifestyle and can afford the treatment have lived an almost normal lifestyle for over 15 years since the initial infection.<br>
 2. The opportunistic infections and AIDS-related illnesses can be treated with medications.<br>
 3. AIDS is a life threatening illness. but people with HIV can improve their lifestyle to help them live healthy lives for many years.<br>
 AIDS is more likely to be appear when the person suffers from other infections, drug and alcohol abuse, poor nutrition, and stress.<br>
 All the medications must be taken together and consistently.<br>
 Current drug regimens can suppress HIV. but no treatments can completely eliminate the virus from the patient's body, because places where the virus can hide are still being discovered.<br>
 4. Most people with HIV are treated with a combination of drugs known as highly active antiretroviral therapy, or HAART.<br>
 These can include NRTIs (Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors) which are the drug cocktails that many people refer to when thinking of HIV.<br>
 5. In South Africa, the pre-exposure prophylaxis tablet PrEP, "Truvada", is prescribed for HIV negative patients exposed to the virus, e.g. female students between 15 and 24 and commercial sex workers.<br>
 The tablet contains two antiretriviral drugs, tenofovir and emtricitabine.<br>
 It does not prevent other sexually transmitted diseases or pregnancy.<br>
 PrEP may have the side effect of kidney dysfunction and minor gastro-intestinal problems.<br>
<br> 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.8.7H">9.8.7</a> The effects of HIV/AIDS<br>
 The effects include loss of fathers or mothers, economic loss, extra burden on medical facilities, accepting HIV positive people in the community.<br>

 However, people are showing concern and health workers should be ready to give them medical and psychological care.<br>

The virus that causes the warts is called human papillomavirus (HPV).
<a href="#5.3.2H">See 5.3.2: </a> Warts contact tracing, Human papilloma viruses (HPV)<br>
 Genital warts are caused by the Human Papilloma Virus, HPV.<br>
 Genital warts are very common in sexually active people with many sexual partners. but the warts may not be visible, e.g. warts on the cervix.<br>
 People who see or feel unusual lumps on the genitals should see a doctor.<br>
 Treat with paints, freezing or burning.<br>
 Repeat treatments are usually necessary.<br>
 Different strains of the wart virus affect different parts of the body.<br>
 Genital warts are different from warts seen on the hands and knees.<br>
 Genital warts are probably spread by sexual contact. but may not appear until months after infection.<br>
 Untreated genital warts are infectious and can be passed on to the sexual partners.<br>
 HPV is among the most common STDs in America and abroad, with an estimated 75% of all sexually active individuals infected by some strain of the disease.<br>
 HPV is best known, because of its connection in causing cervical cancer virus, but many strains also cause genital warts.<br>
 Symptoms: HPV is considered incurable, its symptoms can be treated, and many people resolve infections on their own.<br>
 Treatment: Recently the government approved a new vaccine to protect young women from the four most common strains of the virus.<br>
 Cryotherapy can freezing the abnormal cells with liquid nitrogen and conization removes the abnormal areas.<br>

Tobamoviruses include Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) and Tomato Mosaic Virus (ToMV).<br>
ToBRFV can overcome all known genetic resistance in tomato, including the Tm-22 gene.<br>
It can cause severe fruit symptoms on otherwise resistant tomato varieties.<br>
Pepper is another primary host for ToBRFV.<br>
The L genes for resistance to TMV and PMMoV (Pepper mild mottle virus) in pepper currently seem to hold up to ToBRFV.<br>
Peppers without the resistance gene(s) are highly susceptible to the virus.<br>
Transfer of the virus from infected to healthy plants commonly occurs via mechanical means, e.g. touching and manipulation of infected plants.<br>
ToBRFV is similar to other tobamoviruses in that the virus particles are long, symmetrical rods, so it cannot be distinguished by electron microscopy.<br>
Tomato F1 cultivars that are highly resistant (HR) to ToMV and TMV can be severely affected by this new virus. ToBRFV.<br>
The known resistance genes do not protect against ToBRFV, and only preventative crop management and sanitation practices will produce a useful crop.<br>
Some tomato varieties can develop a high virus level without physically expressing symptoms.<br>
Iinfected plants of these varieties can then become a source for spread of ToBRFV infection to healthy tomato plants or susceptible pepper plants.<br>
Seed companies are working on identifying and introducing resistance to the virus in new varieties.<br>
However, but it could take several years, until new resistant varieties are introduced.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.13H">9.13</a> Tobamovirus<br>
Tobamovirus is a genus in the virus family Virgaviridae.<br>
The name "Tobamovirus" comes from the first virus discovered, (Tobacco mosaic virus).<br>
Tobamovirus is a genus of plant viruses with a rigid helical rod containing linear single-stranded RNA.<br>
Tobacco mosaic virus is the type species and is also known as Tobacco mosaic virus group.<br>
Tobamoviruses are a group of viral diseases that cause mottling and damage to important vegetable, fruit, field and ornamental plants.<br>
They occur in Asia, Nigeria, North America, Brazil, and Europe.<br>
They spread by importation of infected plants and plant material including seeds; local spread through plant to plant contact, pruning, harvesting, and clothing.<br>
Many vegetable crops including melons, squash, tomatoes, potatoes, and capsicum are suseptible, but they do not affect human health.<br>
Tobamoviruses are highly infectious and can survive for long periods in plant material, contaminated soil and on equipment surfaces.<br> 
Plants infected with tobamoviruses have mosaic-like mottling and discolouration on the leaves and fruit.<br> 
The Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus, affects cucurbits, pumpkins, melons and related fruit and vegetables.<br> 
Infected plants produce little fruit and, since there is no cure, they must be destroyed.<br> 
Tobamoviruses include tomato mottle mosaic virus, zucchini green mottle mosaic virus, cucumber mottle virus and tobacco mosaic virus – potato strain.<br>
Farmers and gardeners should look out for, mosaic-like mottling and discoloration on the leaves, distorted leaves, absence of fruit or distorted fruit.<br>
Importation of infected seed, plants and plant material is the most likely way that tobamoviruses infections can occur.<br>
The viruses can infect some weed species, including prostrate pigweed and creeping cucumber.<br>
