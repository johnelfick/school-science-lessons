<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.1H">9.1.</a> Viruses<br>
Viruses are minute infectious agents whose genomes are composed of DNA or RNA, but not both.<br> 
They lack independent metabolism and cannot replicate outside living host cells, so they must infect the cells of other types of organisms to reproduce.<br> 
Most viruses are capable of passing through fine filters that retain bacteria, but are not visible through a light microscope.<br>
1. A viruses consists of two parts, genetic material, DNA or RNA, in a coat of protein.<br>
The nucleic acid in the virus contains instructions for the cell to make new viruses.<br>
A virus is a submicroscopic infectious agent that replication inside a cell by using the cell's own biochemical processes.<br>
 Viruses cause infected cells to produce progeny viruses.<br>
 Retroviruses use the enzyme reverse transcriptase to copy the viral RNA into DNA.<br>
 Viruses are not affected by antibiotics.<br>
 To transduce a cell is to transfer genetic material from another cell to that cell, another usually by a virus particle or a virus.<br>
<br> 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.2H">9.2</a> Virus classification<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.4H">9.4</a> Bacteriophage<br>
<a href="../images/9.3.70.gif">See diagram 9.3.70</a>: T4 bacteriophage that attacks E. coli.<br>
A bacteriophage or "phage" is a very small virus that infects bacteria.<br>
The T4 bacteriophage infects the bacterium Escherichia coli, (E.coli), found in the human gut.<br>
This infection is used to study viruses and how they infect and replicate inside cells.<br>
T-phages have head, capsid, containing double-stranded DNA genetic material.<br>
The tail of the bacteriophage includes the tail, sheath, base plate and tail fibres, made of different proteins, used to attach itself to the bacterium.<br>
The phage then inserts its own genetic material inside of the host bacterial cell so that it replicates and make more bacteriophages.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.5H">9.5</a> Coronavirus<br>
<a href="https://www.coronavirus.gov/">COVID-19 virus</a> Centres for Disease Control and Prevention<br>
<a href="https://www.nih.gov/">CORONAVIRUS</a> National Institutes of Health<br>
Coronaviruses are a big group of viruses that cause illnesses, e.g. common cold or diseases including SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS.<br>
COVID-19, (Corona Virus Disease 19), is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans.<br>
The viruses are named for the corona, or crown, of surface proteins that the virus uses to penetrate the cells of its host.<br>
Coronavirus disease 2019<br>
(COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, (SARS-CoV-2).<br>
The disease had spread globally by 13/03/2020, since 2019, resulting in the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic.<br>
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.<br>
Muscle pain, sputum production and sore throat are some of the less common symptoms.<br>
While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to pneumonia and multi-organ failure.<br>
The case fatality rate is estimated at between 1% and 5%, but varies by age and other health conditions.<br>
<br>
<hr width="100%" size="2"> "Kill Coronavirus by washing your hands with soap"<br>
Based on article by Palli Thordarson, Professor of Chemistry, University of New South Wales.<br>
Viruses can be active outside the body for hours, even days.<br>
Disinfectants, liquids, wipes, gels and creams containing alcohol are all useful at getting rid of them, but they are not quite as good as normal soap.<br>
Health authorities have been giving us two messages:<br>
1. When you have the virus there are no drugs that can kill it or help you get rid of it.<br>
2. Wash your hands to stop the virus spreading.<br>
Why does soap work so well on the Coronavirus, and indeed most viruses?<br>
Because the virus is a self-assembled nanoparticle in which the weakest link is the lipid (fatty) bilayer.<br>
Soap dissolves the fat membrane and the virus falls apart and dies, or rather, we should say it becomes inactive as viruses aren’t really alive.<br>
Most viruses consist of three key building blocks: RNA, proteins and lipids.<br>
A virus-infected cell makes lots of these building blocks, which then spontaneously self-assemble to form the virus.<br>
There are no strong covalent bonds holding these units together, so you do not necessarily need harsh chemicals to split those units apart.<br>
When an infected cell dies, all these new viruses escape and go on to infect other cells.<br>
Some end up also in the airways of lungs.<br>
When you cough, or especially when you sneeze, tiny droplets from the airways can fly up to 10 metres.<br>
The droplets are thought to be the main Coronavirus carriers and they can go at least two metres.<br>
These tiny droplets end on surfaces and often dry out quickly, but the viruses remain active.<br>
Human skin is an ideal surface for a virus, because it is “organic” and the proteins and fatty acids in the dead cells on the surface interact with the virus.<br>
When you touch, say, a steel surface with a virus particle on it, it will stick to your skin and hence get transferred on to your hands.<br>
If you then touch your face, especially your eyes, nostrils or mouth, you can get infected, and most people touch their face once every two to five minutes.<br>
Washing the virus off with water alone might work, but water is not good at competing with the strong, glue-like interactions between the skin and the virus.<br>
Soapy water is different, because it contains fat-like substances, amphiphiles, some of which are structurally similar to the lipids in the virus membrane.<br>
An amphiphile chemical compound, (Greek <i>amphis</i>, and <i>philia</i> both 'love'), has both hydrophilic (water-loving) and lipophilic (fat-loving) properties.<br>
The soap molecules “compete” with the lipids in the virus membrane, which is similar to how soap also removes normal dirt from the skin.<br>
The soap not only loosens the “glue” between the virus and the skin, but also the Velcro-like interactions that hold the proteins, lipids and RNA in the virus together.<br>
Coronavirus hits ill and disabled people hardest.<br>
Alcohol-based products, including most “disinfectant” products, contain typically 60-80% ethanol, and kill viruses in a similar fashion.<br>
But soap is better, because you only need a fairly small amount of soapy water, which, with rubbing, covers your entire hand easily.<br>
Whereas you need to literally soak the virus in ethanol for a brief moment, and wipes or rubbing a gel on the hands does not guarantee that you soak every corner of the skin on your hands effectively enough.<br>
Soap is the best, but do use alcohol-based sanitisers, when soap is not handy or practical.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.10H">9.10</a> Zika virus<br>
Zika virus	Zika fever	rash, fever, red or swollen eyes, pain in joints,
 The Zika virus is on the move and new measures are needed to help to slow it down.<br>
 It is a distressing and disturbing infection that may be linked to thousands of babies being born with microcephaly.<br>
 It is spreading through the Americas.<br>
 Threats from the same virus family are increasing.<br>
 Currently, there is no effective treatment or vaccine against the Zika virus<br>
 The best way to protect yourself is to avoid being bitten by mosquitos.<br>
 The Brazilian Ministry of Health will distribute 500, 000 tests to perform Zika virus diagnostics.<br>
 As a result, public laboratories will expand 20 times to assist with this extra surveillance.<br>
<br>
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.11H">9.11</a> Virus diseases of plants<br>
Viruses may cause yellow patches on leaves and later the plant dies, e.g. in taro and bananas.<br>
These diseases cannot be cured, but if the virus is carried by insects they may be controlled.<br>
The best way to deal with bacterial or virus diseases is to burn the infected plant or part of the plant.<br>
Diseases are carried to plants in four ways:<br>
1. Wind can carry diseases a short distance.<br>
2. Disease can be carried in running water or in the splash of rain drops.<br>
3. Infected plants can pass disease to healthy plants if the plants are touching.<br>
4. Disease can be carried by insect pests that can then infect healthy plants.<br>
Virus diseases include apple mosaic, clover stunt and cymbidium virus of orchids.<br>
Yellow crinkle of papaya and big bud of tomatoes are caused by mycoplasma-like organisms (phytoplasmas).<br>
<br>
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.12H">9.12</a> ToBRFV, New tomato virus, 19/02/2020<br>
Tobamoviruses include Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) and Tomato Mosaic Virus (ToMV).<br>
ToBRFV can overcome all known genetic resistance in tomato, including the Tm-22 gene.<br>
It can cause severe fruit symptoms on otherwise resistant tomato varieties.<br>
Pepper is another primary host for ToBRFV.<br>
The L genes for resistance to TMV and PMMoV (Pepper mild mottle virus) in pepper currently seem to hold up to ToBRFV.<br>
Peppers without the resistance gene(s) are highly susceptible to the virus.<br>
Transfer of the virus from infected to healthy plants commonly occurs via mechanical means, e.g. touching and manipulation of infected plants.<br>
ToBRFV is similar to other tobamoviruses in that the virus particles are long, symmetrical rods, so it cannot be distinguished by electron microscopy.<br>
Tomato F1 cultivars that are highly resistant (HR) to ToMV and TMV can be severely affected by this new virus. ToBRFV.<br>
The known resistance genes do not protect against ToBRFV, and only preventative crop management and sanitation practices will produce a useful crop.<br>
Some tomato varieties can develop a high virus level without physically expressing symptoms.<br>
Iinfected plants of these varieties can then become a source for spread of ToBRFV infection to healthy tomato plants or susceptible pepper plants.<br>
Seed companies are working on identifying and introducing resistance to the virus in new varieties.<br>
However, but it could take several years, until new resistant varieties are introduced.<br>
<br> 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.13H">9.13</a> Tobamovirus<br>
Tobamovirus is a genus in the virus family Virgaviridae.<br>
The name "Tobamovirus" comes from the first virus discovered, (Tobacco mosaic virus).<br>
Tobamovirus is a genus of plant viruses with a rigid helical rod containing linear single-stranded RNA.<br>
Tobacco mosaic virus is the type species and is also known as Tobacco mosaic virus group.<br>
Tobamoviruses are a group of viral diseases that cause mottling and damage to important vegetable, fruit, field and ornamental plants.<br>
They occur in Asia, Nigeria, North America, Brazil, and Europe.<br>
They spread by importation of infected plants and plant material including seeds; local spread through plant to plant contact, pruning, harvesting, and clothing.<br>
Many vegetable crops including melons, squash, tomatoes, potatoes, and capsicum are suseptible, but they do not affect human health.<br>
Tobamoviruses are highly infectious and can survive for long periods in plant material, contaminated soil and on equipment surfaces.<br> 
Plants infected with tobamoviruses have mosaic-like mottling and discolouration on the leaves and fruit.<br> 
The Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus, affects cucurbits, pumpkins, melons and related fruit and vegetables.<br> 
Infected plants produce little fruit and, since there is no cure, they must be destroyed.<br> 
Tobamoviruses include tomato mottle mosaic virus, zucchini green mottle mosaic virus, cucumber mottle virus and tobacco mosaic virus – potato strain.<br>
Farmers and gardeners should look out for, mosaic-like mottling and discoloration on the leaves, distorted leaves, absence of fruit or distorted fruit.<br>
Importation of infected seed, plants and plant material is the most likely way that tobamoviruses infections can occur.<br>
The viruses can infect some weeds, including prostrate pigweed and creeping cucumber.<br>
 One key virus, cucumber green mottle mosaic virus (CGMMV), is under management in some areas of Australia.<br>

DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid, C15H31N3O13P2, primary genetic material polymer of all cells, usually double-stranded, but can be single-stranded.<br>
DNA has a polysugar-phosphate backbone with projections of purines (adenine and guanine) and pyrimidines (thymine and cytosine), to form a double helix.<br>
The double helix is held together by hydrogen bonds between the purines and pyrimidines, (adenine to thymine and guanine to cytosine).<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="RNAH">RNA</a><br>
Ribonucleic acid (RNA), molecule in most organisms and viruses, usually single-stranded, but can be double-stranded.<br>
RNA is made of nucleotides, ribose sugars attached to nitrogenous bases, (adenine, guanine, uracil, and cytosine), and phosphate groups.<br> 
The three main types of RNA involved in protein synthesis are 1. messenger RNA (mRNA), 2. transfer RNA (tRNA), and 3. ribosomal RNA (rRNA).<br>
mRNA is transcribed from DNA and contains the genetic blueprint to make proteins.<br> 
rRNA forms ribosomes, which link amino acids together to create polypeptides.<br> 
RNA mutations can diseases, e.g. Myotonic dystrophy disease, prostate cancer, fragile X syndrome, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). 
RNA viruses have very high mutation rates to produce newer variants with higher infectivity or increased resistance to antivirals, and these mutations are heritable.<br>
HIV infections are examples of where the viruses replicate and cause severe disease, even in the presence of drugs.<br>
