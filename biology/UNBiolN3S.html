Willows are among Australia's worst weeds, because of their invasive tendencies, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts.<br>
They can invade riverbanks and wetlands, causing erosion and blocking waterways.<br>
Willows are a serious weed in Victoria, New South Wales and the Australian Capital<br>
However, weeping willow (Salix babylonica), and 2 hybrid species of pussy willow (Salix x calodendron) and (Salix x reichardtii) are permitted species.<br
Willows are any narrow-leafed species used for basket weaving called an osier, any broad-leaved species called a sallow.<br>
Willow trees were given a pollard, cut off above the bole leaving only the main trunk to produce young straight branches for basket-weaving and wicker items. 
Willow trees or branches of other trees used for basket-making, are called a "withy".<br>
When furry catkins appear in early spring in smaller willow species, e.g. (Salix discolor), (Salix caprea), these trees may be called "pussy willows".<br>
