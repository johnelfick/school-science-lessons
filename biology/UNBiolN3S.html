Willows are among Australia's worst weeds, because of their invasive tendencies, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts.<br>
They can invade riverbanks and wetlands, causing erosion and blocking waterways.<br>
<br> 
Willows are a serious weed in Victoria, New South Wales and the Australian Capital<br>
However, weeping willow (Salix babylonica), and 2 hybrid species of pussy willow (Salix x calodendron) and (Salix x reichardtii) are permitted species.<br
Willows are any narrow-leafed species used for basket weaving called an osier, any broad-leaved species called a sallow.<br>
Willow trees were given a pollard, cut off above the bole leaving only the main trunk to produce young straight branches for basket-weaving and wicker items. 
Willow trees or branches of other trees used for basket-making, are called a "withy".<br>
<br>
When furry catkins appear in early spring in smaller willow species, e.g. (Salix discolor), (Salix caprea), these trees may be called "pussy willows".<br>

Although the flesh is rather acid, it can be eaten raw, but is more often made into highly-prized pies, jams and jellies.<br>
The stones are easily removed and the flesh can be dried for later use.<br>
The seed is said to also be edible and to contain enough oil to burn like a candle.<br>
The ground stones are used as a herbal medicine.
The seedlings are partially parasitic and are best germinated with a host such as grasses, acacias, or even citrus.<br>
To germinate, the seed are cracked in a vice and the kernel removed.<br>
The surface is sterilized with sodium hypochlorite, stored in slightly damp vermiculite, and put in a darkened area at 16 to 20<sup>o</sup>C.<br>

Glycoalkaloids in potatoes are | Solanine | Chaconine | which give flavour at low concentrations, but cause bitterness and are toxic to humans at high concentrations.<br>
The glycoalkaloids protect the potato from attack by insects and fungi.<br>
Potatoes should be stored in cool dark places, because as potato peel becomes greener the concentration of solanine increases, with upper safety limit for glycoalkaloid content is 20 mg per 100 g of potato, but concentrations are much greater in the potato peel.<br>
During World War II, Dutch prisoners of the Nazi military, when fed only on potato peelings, died of solanine poising.<br>
