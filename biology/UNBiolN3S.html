Willows are among Australia's worst weeds, because of their invasive tendencies, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts.<br>
They can invade riverbanks and wetlands, causing erosion and blocking waterways.<br>
<br> 
Willows are a serious weed in Victoria, New South Wales and the Australian Capital<br>
However, weeping willow (Salix babylonica), and 2 hybrid species of pussy willow (Salix x calodendron) and (Salix x reichardtii) are permitted species.<br
Willows are any narrow-leafed species used for basket weaving called an osier, any broad-leaved species called a sallow.<br>
Willow trees were given a pollard, cut off above the bole leaving only the main trunk to produce young straight branches for basket-weaving and wicker items. 
Willow trees or branches of other trees used for basket-making, are called a "withy".<br>
<br>
When furry catkins appear in early spring in smaller willow species, e.g. Salix discolor. Salix caprea, these trees may be called "pussy willows".<br>

<br>
Santalum species, Santalaceae, fruit commonly called a quandong<br>
Desert quandong, (Santalum acuminatum), "Sweet Quandong", is a good eating fruit and nut.<br>
Native to the drier parts of Australia, it regularly fruits without supplemental water.<br>
The rounded, pendulous fruits, 2 to 3 cm across, change from green to bright red.<br>
The firm, fleshy layer surrounding the stone is edible when quite ripe.<br>
This stage is usually indicated by the fruits falling to the ground or rattling when shaken.<br>
Although the flesh is rather acid, it can be eaten raw, but is more often made into highly-prized pies, jams and jellies.<br>
The stones are easily removed and the flesh can be dried for later use.<br>
The seed is said to also be edible and to contain enough oil to burn like a candle.<br>
The seedlings are partially parasitic and are best germinated with a host such as grasses, acacias, or even citrus.<br>
To germinate Santalum seed, they are cracked in a vice and the kernel removed.<br>
The surface is sterilized with sodium hypochlorite, stored in slightly damp vermiculite, and put in a darkened area at 16 to 20<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
However, germination is erratic.<br>
<br>
Quandong, (Santalum acuminatum), desert quandong, sweet quandong, desert peach, native peach, arid inland, hemiparasitic on other tree roots, high in vitamin C, used for exotic flavouring, attempted domestication of species for commercial purposes, edible fruit called a quandong or native peach.<br>

Glycoalkaloids in potatoes are | <a href="../appendices/appendixA.html#SolanineH">Solanine</a> | <a href="../appendices/appendixA.html#ChaconineH">a-Chaconine</a> | which give flavour at low concentrations, but cause bitterness and are toxic to humans at high concentrations.<br>
The glycoalkaloids protect the potato from attack by insects and fungi.<br>
Potatoes should be stored in cool dark places, because as potato peel becomes greener the concentration of solanine increases, with upper safety limit for glycoalkaloid content is 20 mg per 100 g of potato, but concentrations are much greater in the potato peel.<br>

Solanum species, nightshades, Solanaceae<br>
There are more than 100 Solanum species in Australia, but only a half-dozen are edible and the unripe fruits of these are toxic.<br>
Only an expert botanist can advise if a Solanum species found in the wild is edible.<br>
Species called "bush tomatoes" are edible and include (Solanum esuriale), (Solanum centrale), (Solanum ellipticum) and (Solanum cleistogamum).<br>

<a name="SolanumlycH">Tomato plant</a>, (Solanum lycopersicum), up to 2.5 m, annual, light to dark green foliage | toxic alkaloid Tomatidine in roots and leaves and fruits, insecticide | grown as summer crop to year-round in sub-tropical/tropical areas, use well-drained moist soil enriched with plenty of organic matter, in full sun, but protected from winds, small yellow flowers, soft hairy stems, berry fruit usually red.<br>
In 1753, Carl Linnaeus gave the name (Solanum lycopersicum) to the tomato, which takes precedence over the later name (Lycopersicum esculentum).<br>
<br>
Determinate varieties, 'bush tomatoes', are 50 cm to 1 m tall, grown in pots so no staking is needed, have a shorter harvest times than indeterminate tomatoes.<br>
The plants die after they bear fruit, so for continuous production, planting must be staggered throughout the growing season.<br>
Indeterminate varieties, ‘vining’ tomatoes, can climb up to 2.5 m, so staking is needed.<br>
They can be harvested during the whole growing season, so picking often to for more flowers and fruit.<br>
Tomatoes are eaten raw in salads and sandwiches, and are cooked in pastas, soups, stir-fries and paste or chutney.<br>
Tomatoes are a savoury vegetable, with juice sold separately, and fruit powder sold as flavouring and thickening agent, and edible oil is obtained from the seed.<br>
<br>
Plant tomatoes in a sunny place with well-drained soil, with compost, aged manure and a dusting of garden lime.<br>
Plant the first seedling deeper than normal, then remove the first set of leaves and for a planting depth guide.<br>
For indeterminate varieties, insert stakes or a trellis for support as they grow and tie the plants loosely to the stakes with soft garden ties.<br>
Add organic mulch, e.g. crushed sugarcane stems, to conserve moisture and suppress weeds.<br>
Remove lateral shoots, or side shoots between the main stem and branches, to encourage plants to grow vertically.<br>
Add water regularly in the early morning around the base of the plant to avoid wetting the foliage.<br>
Add organic pelletised fertiliser each month and use liquid fertiliser high in potassium.<br>
Harvest 10-12 weeks from sowing, when the skin is firm and the colour has changed.<br>
Treat aphids, whitefly, caterpillars (budworm) and mites with organic insecticide.<br>
<br>
The females of the Queensland fruit fly (Bactrocera tryoniI 'Qfly') and Mediterranean fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata 'Medfly') lays eggs in the tomato fruit and the larvae spoil the fruit and cause it to drop.<br>
 Use fruit fly traps to detect fruit fly activity and spray a fruit fly insecticide.<br>
The fungal diseases, powdery mildew and leaf spots occur if tomato leaves are consistently wet and there is inadequate spacing between plants.<br>
<br>
The wilts that affect tomatoes include the following:
*Verticillium wilt fungus and fusarium wilt fungus are persistent infections from the soil, which cause withering from the base upwards and stems that are black or red brown inside.<br>
* Bacterial wilt causes rapid wilting and death of the plant.<br>
* Spotted wilt virus causes brown leaf spots and rings.<br>
