<a href="../images/9.47.2.gif">See diagram 9.47.2</a>: Moss life cycle.<br>
 Mosses have an upright or creeping gametophyte with leaves arranges spirally.<br>
 The sporophyte has a tough seta that persists after spore dispersal.<br>
 In open country, moss grows mostly on the north side of trees in the Northern Hemisphere and on the south side of trees in the Southern Hemisphere.<br>
 Mosses grow 1-10 cm tall in clumps or mats in shady or damp locations.<br>
 Some grow on trees, fences and walls.<br>
 Mosses have multicellular rhizoids and distinct stems and leaves.<br>
 Mosses have an upright or creeping gametophyte with leaves arranged spirally.<br>
 If the sex organs are developed on different plants, as with Dawsonia, the antheridia are attached to a cup-like receptacle at the apex of the male plant.<br>
 The antheridia burst to release sperm that use their two cilia to swim in rain water to the archegonia at the apex of the female plants and fertilize the ova.<br>
 The zygote grows vertically into the sporophyte that remains attached to the female plant and consists of a long stalk, seta and a capsule containing the sporogonium.<br>
 The mature capsule will release very light spores to be dispersed by the wind and grow into the next gametophyte generation.<br>

Stoneworts are branched multicellular algae that have no flower, wll not extend above the water surface, light to dark green in color with forked, bushy branches.<br>
Common stonewort, (Chara vulgaris, Linnaeus 1753), Chara, (Greek <i>charaties</i> graceful, 'the three graces'), called “muskgrass”, because of its musky earthy odour), and called “stonewort”, because of the deposition of rough to touch marl, calcium carbonate, on its epidermis.<br>
It is a freshwater giant green algae with structures like stems and leaves, so looks like a higher plant.<br>
It was used for investigation of fundamental physiological processes, because its large internodal cells manipulated to generate action potentials in response to<br> mechanical stimulation or direct electrical stimulation, leading to study of mechanisms of excitability.<br>
It was used to study rapid cytoplasmic streaming and gravitropism.<br>
<br>
Smooth stonewort, (Nitella flexilis), freshwater algae, axes up to 1m, and 1 mm wide, large cell sie, cultivated in the laboratory, branched, Family Characeae<br>
has no odour and are soft to the touch, unlike Chara<br>
Both Nitella and Chara are cultured in Biology classes to observe protoplasmic streaming and other processes in these large cells.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="6.5.7H">6.5.7</a> Microalgae<br>
Microalgae, (microphytes), occur in freshwater and marine environments.<br>
They are unicellular, but may exist individually or in chains or groups.<br>
Experiments may include the effect of the following on the growth of microalgae:<br>
 1. Light intensity,  2. Different coloured light,  3. Carbon dioxide,  4. Nutrients (change nitrate, phosphate), 5. Micro-nutrients, e.g. vitamins.<br>
 Culture the microalgae in test tubes and record the daily growth.<br>
 You can use a haemocytometer for counting the microalgae.<br>
 Culture under ideal conditions for 10 days to get a graph similar to bacterial growth (exponential graph).<br>
 CSIRO supplies microalgae "starter" cultures and technical advice to industry, research and educational institutions in more than 65 countries since 1986.<br>
 In the aquaculture industry, microalgae are the essential first foods for larval and juvenile animals.<br>
 Cultures are grown under controlled-environment conditions in a purpose-built, Australian Quarantine Inspection Service AQIS) accredited algal culture facility.<br>
CSIRO supplies cultures in 20 millilitre and 250 millilitre quantities, algal plate cultures for selected aquaculture strains, and strains for educational purposes.<br>
Available microalgae strains include those from marine, estuarine and freshwater species.<br>
Also available are aquaculture strains and toxin-producing species.<br>
Selected strains are axenic (bacteria-free).<br>
These algae can be maintained for a long time in the laboratory by sub culturing in agar plates.<br>
Some micro-algae can be used in aquaculture for penaeid shrimp larvae, bivalve mollusc larvae, freshwater prawn larvae, postlarvae, abalone larvae, 
marine rotifers (Brachionus), brine shrimp (Artemia salina), saltwater copepods, freshwater zooplankton.<br>

Ginkgo biloba extract ECb 761, "Tebonin" is sold as a standardied extract of Ginkgo biloba leaves, which has antioxidant properties as a free radical scavenger ECb 761 has been available in Europe as a herbal extract since the early 1990s, however, products containing ECb 761 are not approved for use by the US FDA, (2016).<br>
The psychological and physiological effects of ginkgo are said to be based on its primary action of regulating neurotransmitters and exerting neuroprotective effects in the brain, protecting against or retarding nerve cell degeneration, and improving blood flow in small blood vessels.<br>
There is no clear research evidence that Ginkgo retards memory loss in adults over 60, or treats sudden deafness, tinnitus, or diabetes, but research is continuing.<br>

Floating crystalwort, (Riccia fluitans), aquarium plant, liverwort, forms dense floating mats Ricciaceae, Phylum Hepatophyta.<br>
Liverworts are the most lowly land plants with single-celled rhioids and no clearly-differentiated stem and leaves.<br>
They grow in moist shady habitats on wet rocks or near shallow streams, usually clumped together to save moisture.<br>
The plant is the gametophyte generation, a broad branching thallus.<br>
Together the plants look like little leaves clumped together and attached to the damp soil by hair-like rhioids.<br>
The antheridia produce swimming sperm that fertilie an ovum in the archegonium to form the ygote that grows into the sporophyte.<br>
The sporophyte has no chlorophyll and remains a sort of parasite with no connection to the soil, but attached to the archegonium.<br>
It releases spores that develop into the next gametophyte generation.<br>
Marchantia reproduces rapidly by vegetative buds produced in gemma cups.<br>
The sexual organs, the antheridia and archegonia are formed on different plants.<br>
Liverworts have alternation of generations, because they have a flat leafy (n, haploid) gametophyte and have a delicate stalk (seta) (2n, diploid) sporophyte that dies after spore dispersal.<br>

Large mosquito fern, (Azolla filiculoides), duckweed fern, fairy moss, water fern, up to 7 cm, bright green then red-purple upper leaves stay afloat, submercged lower leaves on short stem have feathery roots, widely introduced to decorate ornamental ponds.<br>
It grows in waterways in dense patches, which can make it look like a green or red carpet.<br> 
In the shade, it is a bright green colour but it changes to deep red when exposed to the sun.<br> 
It is beneficial to the aquatic environment as a food source and it provides habitat for many small organisms.<br>
It can discourage blue-green algal blooms as its 'mats' restrict the penetration of sunlight into the water and takes up nutrients from the water column.<br>
So removal of azolla from waterways can cause bloom of toxic blue-green algae.<br>
It can be a form of biological mosquito control, because the mats prevent mosquito larvae surfacing for air.<br>
It can can restrict the growth of exotic aquatic plants, including salvinia and water hyacinth, and become a significant weed competing against indigenous waterway vegetation and causing pollution of drinking water.<br>
However, where waterways are extremely rich in nutrients, extensive growth of Azolla can cause de-oxygenation of the water, leading to decay of aquatic animals and plants that can cause a strong odour.<br> 
Phototrophic cyanobacterium, (Anabaena azollae), can fix atmospheric nitrogen, lives symbiotically in leaf cavities of Azolla species.<br>
Azolla is cultivated then rots as  nitrogen fertilier as it decomposes for the rice industry in Vietnam, China and the Philippines.<br>

Bunya pine, (Araucaria bidwillii), bunya nut, up to 45 m, straight rough-barked trunk,symmetrical dome-shaped crown, lance-shaped sharply pointe and glossy green leaves narrow male cones on the ends of short branchlets, large, female fruiting cones form once every three years, danger from both cones falling from the tree, female cone contains up to 100 large “Bunya nuts”, Australian native food, widely planted, valuable as an ornamental and a timber tree, large pineapple-shaped cones "bunya nuts", every 3 years, in Brisbane City Botanic Gardens, Australian native food, Araucariaceae<br>
<a href="https://www.daleysfruit.com.au/search.php?q2=Araucaria%20bidwillii">Araucaria bidwillii</a>, Daleys Fruit Trees<br>
The Bunya nut is extracted from large  pine cones contain between 50 to 100 nuts and weigh as much as 10 kg.<br>
The cones are covered in spikes and fall from towering heights of 30-45 metres.<br>
Nuts are produced each year, but a bumper crop is produced every three years, near Brisbane.<br>
The flavour is described similar to a starchy potato or chestnut or a blend of chestnuts and pine nuts.<br>
Either way the kernel must be removed from the shell before being boiled in salty water or placed in the fire for cooking.<br>
For nuts-shelling, place the nuts in a jug or bowl and cover with boiling water for 2-3 minutes.<br>
This softens the shells making it easier to cut and makes the brown skin surrounding the nut, stick to the inside of the shell allowing the nut to be removed cleanly.<br>
Use a strong short blade knife or Stanley knife and slice down the length of the nut.<br>
This method has been described as 'dangerous', so some people use a pair of secateurs or a ratchet poly pipe cutter.<br>
The softened shell will peel away from the nut.<br>
Slice the nut in half and discard the centre pith which can have a bitter after taste.<br>
Place the nuts in boiling water and simmer for 10 minutes.<br>
Cool slightly before shelling to extract the edible nut.<br>
To make a nut meal, place in blender when cold and process to bread crumb consistency.<br>
Use shelled nuts (raw or boiled) and toss lightly in a hot pan with melted butter or your favourite oil.<br>
Be careful not to overcook as the nut flesh will become hard and leathery.<br>
Turn the nuts frequently for even cooking.<br>
The nuts are pierced and then roasted.<br>
When cooking directly on the fire, the use of hot ashes gives better results as the shells can ignite on hot coals of flames.<br>
Bunya kernels (If bunya has cooled, reheat in steamer as temperature is important).<br>
Briefly blend hot kernels then add 175ml boiling water, add 1 tsp salt and 100ml Macadamia oil, blend on high speed 5 minutes, stop and scrape.<br>
Dissolve 1½ tsp honey in 175ml hot water, add to mix and blend on high speed for 15 minutes.<br>
Scrape, mix, remove and chill, may be froen for storage, must be labelled with date and batch.<br>
