<a href="../images/9.47.2.gif">See diagram 9.47.2</a>: Moss life cycle.<br>
 Mosses have an upright or creeping gametophyte with leaves arranges spirally.<br>
 The sporophyte has a tough seta that persists after spore dispersal.<br>
 In open country, moss grows mostly on the north side of trees in the Northern Hemisphere and on the south side of trees in the Southern Hemisphere.<br>
 Mosses grow 1-10 cm tall in clumps or mats in shady or damp locations.<br>
 Some grow on trees, fences and walls.<br>
 Mosses have multicellular rhizoids and distinct stems and leaves.<br>
 Mosses have an upright or creeping gametophyte with leaves arranged spirally.<br>
 If the sex organs are developed on different plants, as with Dawsonia, the antheridia are attached to a cup-like receptacle at the apex of the male plant.<br>
 The antheridia burst to release sperm that use their two cilia to swim in rain water to the archegonia at the apex of the female plants and fertilize the ova.<br>
 The zygote grows vertically into the sporophyte that remains attached to the female plant and consists of a long stalk, seta and a capsule containing the sporogonium.<br>
 The mature capsule will release very light spores to be dispersed by the wind and grow into the next gametophyte generation.<br>

Stoneworts are branched multicellular algae that have no flower, wll not extend above the water surface, light to dark green in color 
with forked, bushy branches.<br>
Common stonewort, (Chara vulgaris), (Linnaeus 1753), Chara, (Greek <i>charaties</i> graceful, 'the three graces')
It is called “muskgrass”, because of its musky earthy odour, and called “stonewort”, because of the deposition of rough to touch marl, calcium carbonate, on its epidermis.<br>
It is a freshwater giant green algae with structures like stems and leaves, so looks like a higher plant.<br>
It was used for investigation of fundamental physiological processes, because its large internodal cells manipulated to generate action 
potentials in response to mechanical stimulation or direct electrical stimulation, leading to study of mechanisms of excitability.<br>
It was used to study rapid cytoplasmic streaming and gravitropism.<br>
<br>
Smooth stonewort, (Nitella flexilis), freshwater algae, axes up to 1m, and 1 mm wide, large cell sie, is cultivated in the laboratory, branched, Family Characeae.<br>
It has no odour and are soft to the touch, unlike (Chara vulgaris).<br>
Both Nitella and Chara are cultured in Biology classes to observe protoplasmic streaming and other processes in these large cells.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.3.15H">9.3.15</a> Microalgae<br>
Microalgae, (microphytes), occur in freshwater and marine environments, and are unicellular, but may exist individually or in chains or groups.<br>
Experiments may include the effect of the following on the growth of microalgae:<br>
 1. Light intensity, 2. Different coloured light, 3. Carbon dioxide, 4. Nutrients (change nitrate, phosphate), 5. Micro-nutrients, e.g. vitamins.<br>
 Culture the microalgae in test tubes and record the daily growth.<br>
 Use a haemocytometer for counting the microalgae.<br>
 Culture under ideal conditions for 10 days to get a graph similar to bacterial growth (exponential graph).<br>
 CSIRO supplies microalgae "starter" cultures and technical advice to industry, research and educational institutions in more than 65 countries since 1986.<br>
 In the aquaculture industry, microalgae are the essential first foods for larval and juvenile animals.<br>
 Cultures are grown under controlled-environment conditions in a purpose-built, Australian Quarantine Inspection Service AQIS) accredited algal culture facility.<br>
CSIRO supplies cultures in 20 millilitre and 250 millilitre quantities, algal plate cultures for selected aquaculture strains, and strains for educational purposes.<br>
Available microalgae strains include those from marine, estuarine and freshwater species.<br>
Also available are aquaculture strains and toxin-producing species.<br>
Selected strains are axenic (bacteria-free).<br>
These algae can be maintained for a long time in the laboratory by sub culturing in agar plates.<br>
Some micro-algae can be used in aquaculture as food for penaeid shrimp larvae, bivalve mollusc larvae, freshwater prawn larvae, postlarvae, 
abalone larvae, marine rotifers (Brachionus), brine shrimp (Artemia salina), saltwater copepods, freshwater zooplankton.<br>

The Coniferophyta, or Pinophyta, or Coniferae, commonly known as conifers, are vascular land plants containing a single class, Pinopsida.<br>
Conifers are cone-bearing seed plants, a subset of gymnosperms, perennial woody plants with secondary growth.<br>
Conifers include the pine, fir, spruce, other cone-bearing trees and shrubs, and yews<br>
Coniferophyta, Pinophyta, conifers are seed-bearing plants with ovules on the edge of an open sporophyll.<br>
The sporophylls are arranged in cone-like structures.<br>
Conifers are pyramidal or conical trees with long straight stems that taper to an apical growing point, the leader.<br>
The almost horizontal branches bear narrow needle-shaped leaves.<br>
The original tap root dies leaving shallow roots that let the tree be blown over by storms.<br>
Smaller roots have no root hairs, but have a sheath of fungus that penetrates into the root epidermis.<br>
Small microspore cones at the ends of branches produce microspores, pollen grains.<br>
Large megaspore cones are made up of leaf-like sporophylls that contain the ova.<br>
The fertilized ova develop to form seeds released when the woody cone opens.<br>
Most conifers produce woody cones by lignification of the seed-bearing sporophylls, but Juniperus, Podocarpus and Taxus have soft fruit.<br>

Ferns are vascular plants with xylem and phloem, true leaves, but no seeds.<br>
The stag's horn is a common epiphyte in rainforests.<br>
The asexual phase, the sporophyte, is the large fern that develops spores in sporangia.<br>
The sexual phase, the gametophyte, develops the sexual organs.<br>
It is an insignificant little plant like a little flat leaf, the size of a fingernail.<br>

It grows in waterways in dense patches, which can make it look like a green or red carpet.<br> 
In the shade, it is a bright green colour but it changes to deep red when exposed to the sun.<br> 
It is beneficial to the aquatic environment as a food source and it provides habitat for many small organisms.<br>
It can discourage blue-green algal blooms as its 'mats' restrict the penetration of sunlight into the water and takes up nutrients from the water column.<br>
So removal of azolla from waterways can cause bloom of toxic blue-green algae.<br>
It can be a form of biological mosquito control, because the mats prevent mosquito larvae surfacing for air.<br>
It can can restrict the growth of exotic aquatic plants, including salvinia and water hyacinth, and become a significant weed competing against indigenous 
waterway vegetation and causing pollution of drinking water.<br>
However, where waterways are extremely rich in nutrients, extensive growth of Azolla can cause de-oxygenation of the water, leading to decay of aquatic 
animals and plants that can cause a strong odour.<br>

1. Clubmoss spores called "lycopodium powder", or "flash powder" may explode in the air if ignited, fine yellow 
powder, highly flammable, called "Dragon's Breath" at magic shops, dangerous game to throw at people's legs then ignite.<br>
2. Lycopodium powder, made from the dried spores of Clubmosses, contain a lot of fat, which is hydrophobic.<br>
Sprinkle lycopodium powder on the surface of water, then stick your finger through the powder into the water.<br>
The lycopodium powder coats your finger and prevents the water from touching your skin, so when you pull out your finger, it feels dry.<br>

Whisk fern, (Psilotum nudum), fork fern, two species, tropics and subtropics, "living fossil", no roots, epiphytic and terrestrial, leaves greatly reduced, 
but green wiry stems, rhizome produces reduced leaves not roots, one of the few nonflowering rootless weeds, usually epiphytic or in rock crevices, ornamental, 
stems like chicken feet, spores colledcted for talcum powder and as a purge, was used as a small broom, widespread in the world, Psilotaceae<br>
(Latin <i>nudum</i> 'naked'), because it seems to lack the organs of vascular plants, but some exist in a reduced form<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="BunyaspH">(Araucaria bidwillii)</a> Bunya pine, bunya nut, up to 45 m, straight rough-barked trunk,symmetrical 
dome-shaped crown, lance-shaped sharply pointe and glossy green leaves narrow male cones on the ends of short branchlets, large, female fruiting cones
 form once every three years, danger from both cones falling from the tree, female cone contains up to 100 large “Bunya nuts”, Australian native food, 
widely planted, valuable as an ornamental and a timber tree, large pineapple-shaped cones "bunya nuts", every 3 years, in Brisbane City Botanic Gardens, 
Australian native food, Araucariaceae<br>
<a href="https://www.daleysfruit.com.au/search.php?q2=Araucaria%20bidwillii">Araucaria bidwillii</a>, Daleys Fruit Trees<br>
The Bunya nut is extracted from large pine cones contain between 50 to 100 nuts and weigh as much as 10 kg.<br>
The cones are covered in spikes and fall from towering heights of 30-45 metres.<br>
Nuts are produced each year, but a bumper crop is produced every three years, near Brisbane.<br>
The flavour is described similar to a starchy potato or chestnut or a blend of chestnuts and pine nuts.<br>
Either way the kernel must be removed from the shell before being boiled in salty water or placed in the fire for cooking.<br>
For nuts-shelling, place the nuts in a jug or bowl and cover with boiling water for 2-3 minutes.<br>
This softens the shells making it easier to cut and makes the brown skin surrounding the nut, stick to the inside of the shell allowing the nut to be removed cleanly.<br>
Use a strong short blade knife or Stanley knife and slice down the length of the nut.<br>
This method has been described as 'dangerous', so some people use a pair of secateurs or a ratchet poly pipe cutter.<br>
The softened shell will peel away from the nut.<br>
Slice the nut in half and discard the centre pith which can have a bitter after taste.<br>
Place the nuts in boiling water and simmer for 10 minutes.<br>
Cool slightly before shelling to extract the edible nut.<br>
To make a nut meal, place in blender when cold and process to bread crumb consistency.<br>
Use shelled nuts (raw or boiled) and toss lightly in a hot pan with melted butter or your favourite oil.<br>
Be careful not to overcook as the nut flesh will become hard and leathery.<br>
Turn the nuts frequently for even cooking.<br>
The nuts are pierced and then roasted.<br>
When cooking directly on the fire, the use of hot ashes gives better results as the shells can ignite on hot coals of flames.<br>
Bunya kernels (If bunya has cooled, reheat in steamer as temperature is important).<br>
Briefly blend hot kernels then add 175ml boiling water, add 1 tsp salt and 100ml Macadamia oil, blend on high speed 5 minutes, stop and scrape.<br>
Dissolve 1½ tsp honey in 175ml hot water, add to mix and blend on high speed for 15 minutes.<br>
Scrape, mix, remove and chill, may be froen for storage, must be labelled with date and batch.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.2.1H">9.2.1</a> Moss experiments<br>
 1. Examine capsules of Funaria or other mosses at different stages of maturity and note the peristome and the method of liberation of spores.<br>
 If you fix a cut off capsule in wax, you can examine the peristome under low power.<br>
 Breath on the capsule to show the hygroscopic movements of the peristome teeth.<br>
<br>
 2. Collect protonema of Polytrichum from hedgerows or on the soil in flower pots.<br>
 Polytrichum spores germinate to form a filamentous stage called a protonema.<br>
 Later, buds form on the protonema to grow into the moss plant.<br>
 Polytrichum often mingles with Vaucheria, but Polytrichum is septate.<br>
 Observe the green filaments with transverse septa and the brownish rhizoids with oblique septa.<br>
 Observe buds on the green filaments and young plants in various stages of development.<br>
<br>
 3. Look for the male and female plant, female plant with attached sporogonium, leaves, stem, rhizoids, sporogonium capsule, sporogonium seta.<br>
 4. Collect common woodland mosses usually found in compact colonies or cushions in damp shady places.<br>
 Some grow on the damper side or south side of tree trunks and fence posts.<br>
 Observe the erect stems, small leaves, and the rhizoids that attach the plant to the soil.<br>
 Look for terminal cups, sexual organs, and tubular capsules that contain asexual spores.<br>
 Some tufts of plants bear rosette-like antheridia cups containing spores.<br>
 Note the structure of the antheridia and paraphyses, sterile hairs or filaments that bear the spore-making structures, the sporangia.<br>
 The archegonia cups that house the ovum are less conspicuous, so you may have to dissect more than one apex to find an archegonium.<br>
<br>
 5. Use four areas of activity: 1. field observations, 2. spore culture, 3. cultivation of gametophytes, 4. investigation of spore and leafy gametophyte growth to 
 study the times of spore discharge, growth of the protonema, leafy gametophyte production, sex organ production (archegonia and<br>antheridia), 
 fertilization, growth of sporophyte, relative importance of reproduction by spores or gemmae and tubers.<br>
 Use information on local temperatures, day length, rainfall, to relate to observations of life cycles.<br>
 6. The upper part of the moss capsule (sporangium) may be specialized for gradual spore discharge.<br>
 The life cycle of moss begins with asexual reproduction.<br>
 Leaf-like moss grow thin, brown stalk with capsules at the top.<br>
 The capsules contain tiny spores instead of sex cells.<br>
 Spores are the cells that can develop into a new individual without fertilization.<br>
 Mosses reproduce by means of spores which are dispersed from the mouth of the capsule by the numerous rays (orange and brown), that snap open.<br>
 Grow moss spores and study which factors of the environment controls germination, growth, differentiation of leafy gametophytes.<br>
Mature spore filled capsules are mostly available in the latter half of the year in the Southern Hemisphere.<br>
A problem is how to count the numbers of spores per capsule, per culture, or the number of leafy gametophytes that form.<br>
Leafy gametophytes grow from the protonema.<br>

Selaginella experiments<br>
<a href="../images/9.49.gif">See diagram 9.49</a>: Selaginella.<br>
1. Look for the Selaginella plant, cone, scale leaves, lateral leaves, rhizophores.<br>
Observe the microsporangia containing many microspores, and megasporangium containing four megaspores.<br>
 The Clubmoss have club-shaped cones that bear spores and are known as "fern allies".<br>
 Plants of the Selaginella genus, spikemoss, are small prostrate plants with four rows of small leaves on the axis.<br>
 They live in damp places.<br>
 (Selaginella kraussiana) and (Selaginella martensii) are grown in greenhouses.<br>
 The Selaginella plant is a sporophyte bearing microsporangia and megasporangia in the same cone.<br>
 A microsporangium produces microspores to be dropped onto damp soil and later eject a swimming sperm.<br>
 The larger megasporangium produces megaspores to be dropped onto the soil, germinate in rainy weather, 
and produce a female prothallus with an ovum inside.<br>
 The ovum is fertilized by the sperm to form a zygote that grows into the next sporophyte generation.<br>
 Both types of spores have a tri-radiate ridge from origin in the tetrads following meiosis.<br>
 Experiments<br>
 1. Collect the microspores and megaspores from a ripe cone and scatter the spores on moist absorbent paper.<br>
 Observe the development of young sporophytes.<br>
 2. In Lycopodium note the presence of definite cones.<br>
 Examine the sporangia, both externally and by cutting sections of the cones.<br>
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.10.2H">9.10.2</a> Ferns experiments<br>
 1. Examine Dryopteris, wood fern.<br>
 Note the rhizome and adventitious roots, stem and compound leaves, fronds.<br>
 Note the sori (singular: sorus) under the recurved fronds where spores are formed.<br>
 Dryopteris has rounded sori.<br>
 Pteridium has long sori along the margins of the pinnules.<br>
 Look for the sori under a leaf, compound leaf or frond, coiled young leaf, rhizome, and roots.<br>
 2. Cut a transverse section of a pinnule of Dryopteris to pass through a sorus.<br>
 Observe the tissues of the leaf, the placenta, sporangia in various stages of development in the indusium.<br>
 3. Dehiscence of fern sporangia Pteridium<br>
 Scrape some ripe sporangia into a drop of glycerine on a slide.<br>
 The glycerine withdraws water from the annulus cells and thus causes the opening of the sporangia.<br>
 You can slow the movements of the annulus with glycerine.<br>
 Scrape other sporangia on to a warm slide and observe the annulus movements under the microscope.<br>
 4. Fern prothallus Pteridium<br>
 To grow fern prothalli, place a soaked flower pot inside a larger one, packing the space between with wet sphagnum or peat.<br>
 Allow a mature frond bearing a sorus to dry on a piece of paper and then scatter the spores so obtained on the inner surface of the small flower pot.<br>
 Stand the pots in an inch or so of water and cover the top of the pots with a sheet of glass.<br>
 Green prothalli will soon appear, and you can observe successive stages in their development.<br>
 Observe the archegonia and the liberation of sperms from the antheridia.<br>
Young sporophytes will develop if you water the prothalli after they show archegonia.<br>
