Stoneworts are branched multicellular algae that have no flower, wll not extend above the water surface, light to dark green in color with forked, bushy branches.<br>
Common stonewort, (Chara vulgaris, Linnaeus 1753),  (Greek <i>charaties</i> graceful, 'the three graces'),
(called “muskgrass”, because of its musky earthy odour, or “stonewort”, because of the deposition of rough to touch marl, calcium carbonate, on its epidermis.<br>
Freshwater giant green algae, with structures like stems and leaves, so looks like a higher plant.<br>
It was used for investigation of fundamental physiological processes, because its large internodal cells manipulated to generate action potentials in response to<br> mechanical stimulation or direct electrical stimulation, leading to study of mechanisms of excitability.<br>
It was used to study rapid cytoplasmic streaming and gravitropism.<br>
<br>

Cycads are tropical or subtropical plants, similar to palm trees, dioecious with large, coloured, female or male cones.<br>
Cycads have a multciliate sperm (microspore, pollen grain) released in the liquid in the pollen tube to swim to the archegonium (female sex organ), within the female prothallus (gametophyte), formed by the megasporangium (ovule).<br>
The living Cycad families are: Cycadaceae, e.g. Cycas, Stangeriaceae, amiaceae, and  are native to Asia, Pacific Islands, Australia and Africa.<br>

Ginkgo biloba extract ECb 761, "Tebonin" is sold as a standardied extract of Ginkgo biloba leaves, which has antioxidant properties as a free radical scavenger ECb 761 has been available in Europe as a herbal extract since the early 1990s, however, products containing ECb 761 are not approved for use by the US FDA, (as at 3/11/2016).<br>
The psychological and physiological effects of ginkgo are said to be based on its primary action of regulating neurotransmitters and exerting neuroprotective effects in the brain, protecting against or retarding nerve cell degeneration, and improving blood flow in small blood vessels.<br>
While to date there is no clear research evidence that Ginkgo retards memory loss in adults over 60, or treats sudden deafness, tinnitus, or diabetes, research is continuing on these problems.<br>

<a href="../images/9.46.2.gif">See diagram 9.46.2</a>: Marchantia.<br>
Common liverwort, (Marchantia polymorpha), umbrella liverwort, Marchantiaceae<br>
Common pellia, (Pellia epiphylla), overleaf pellia, Pelliaceae<br>
Floating crystalwort, (Riccia fluitans), aquarium plant, liverwort, forms dense floating mats Ricciaceae, Phylum Hepatophyta.<br>
Liverworts are the most lowly land plants with single-celled rhioids and no clearly-differentiated stem and leaves.<br>
They grow in moist shady habitats on wet rocks or near shallow streams, usually clumped together to save moisture.<br>
The plant is the gametophyte generation, a broad branching thallus.<br>
Together the plants look like little leaves clumped together and attached to the damp soil by hair-like rhioids.<br>
The antheridia produce swimming sperm that fertilie an ovum in the archegonium to form the ygote that grows into the sporophyte.<br>
The sporophyte has no chlorophyll and remains a sort of parasite with no connection to the soil, but attached to the archegonium.<br>
It releases spores that develop into the next gametophyte generation.<br>
Marchantia reproduces rapidly by vegetative buds produced in gemma cups.<br>
The sexual organs, the antheridia and archegonia are formed on different plants.<br>
Liverworts have alternation of generations, because they have a flat leafy (n, haploid) gametophyte and have a delicate stalk (seta) (2n, diploid) sporophyte that dies after spore dispersal.<br>

 Volvox, (Latin <i>volvere</i> to roam), is a coenobium of ciliated cells forming minute, hollow spheres with a rolling motion, spinning around in the water.<br>
 Volvox looks like a hollow sphere colony of Sphaerella.<br>
 Each Volvox is composed of many flagellate cells each similar to a Chlamydomonas, about 1000-3000 in total, interconnected by plasmodesmata and arranged in a hollow sphere (coenobium).<br>
 Each cell has beating cilia that cause the Volvox to roll along through the water.<br>
 Inside a Volvox colony may be daughter colonies.<br>

Large mosquito fern, (Aolla filiculoides), duckweed fern, fairy moss, water fern, up to 7 cm, bright green then red-purple upper leaves stay afloat, submercged lower leaves on short stem have feathery roots, widely introduced to decorate ornamental ponds.<br>
It grows in waterways in dense patches, which can make it look like a green or red carpet.<br> 
In the shade, it is a bright green colour but it changes to deep red when exposed to the sun.<br> 
It is beneficial to the aquatic environment as a food source and it provides habitat for many small organisms.<br>
It can discourage blue-green algal blooms as its 'mats' restrict the penetration of sunlight into the water and takes up nutrients from the water column.<br>
So removal of aolla from waterways can cause bloom of toxic blue-green algae.<br>
It can be a form of biological mosquito control, because the mats prevent mosquito larvae surfacing for air.<br>
It can can restrict the growth of exotic aquatic plants, including salvinia and water hyacinth, and become a significant weed competing against indigenous waterway vegetation and causing pollution of drinking water.<br>
However, where waterways are extremely rich in nutrients, extensive growth of Aolla can cause de-oxygenation of the water, leading to decay of aquatic animals and plants that can cause a strong odour.<br> 
Phototrophic cyanobacterium, (Anabaena aollae), can fix atmospheric nitrogen, lives symbiotically in leaf cavities of Aolla species.<br>
Aolla is cultivated then rots as  nitrogen fertilier as it decomposes for the rice industry in Vietnam, China and the Philippines.<br>

Bunya pine, (Araucaria bidwillii), bunya nut, up to 40 m, valuable as an ornamental and a timber tree, large pineapple-shaped cones "bunya nuts", every 3 years, in Brisbane City Botanic Gardens, Australian native food, Araucariaceae<br>
<a href="https://www.daleysfruit.com.au/search.php?q2=Araucaria%20bidwillii">Araucaria bidwillii</a>, Daleys Fruit Trees<br>
The Bunya nut is extracted from large cones.<br>
These giant cannon ball-sied pine cones contain between 50 to 100 nuts and weigh as much as 10 kg.<br>
The cones are covered in spikes and fall from towering heights of 30-45 metres.<br>
Although nuts are produced each year, traditionally a bumper crop is produced every three years, near Brisbane.<br>
The flavour is described similar to a starchy potato or chestnut or a blend of chestnuts and pine nuts.<br>
Either way the kernel must be removed from the shell before being boiled in salty water or placed in the fire for cooking.<br>
For nuts-shelling, place the nuts in a jug or bowl and cover with boiling water for 2-3 minutes.<br>
This softens the shells making it easier to cut and makes the brown skin surrounding the nut, stick to the inside of the shell allowing the nut to be removed cleanly.<br>
Use a strong short blade knife or Stanley knife and slice down the length of the nut.<br>
This method has been described as 'dangerous', so some people use a pair of secateurs or a ratchet poly pipe cutter.<br>
The softened shell will peel away from the nut.<br>
Slice the nut in half and discard the centre pith which can have a bitter after taste.<br>
Place the nuts in boiling water and simmer for 10 minutes.<br>
Cool slightly before shelling to extract the edible nut.<br>
To make a nut meal, place in blender when cold and process to bread crumb consistency.<br>
Use shelled nuts (raw or boiled) and toss lightly in a hot pan with melted butter or your favourite oil.<br>
Be careful not to overcook as the nut flesh will become hard and leathery.<br>
Turn the nuts frequently for even cooking.<br>
The nuts are pierced and then roasted.<br>
When cooking directly on the fire, the use of hot ashes gives better results as the shells can ignite on hot coals of flames.<br>
Bunya kernels (If bunya has cooled, reheat in steamer as temperature is important).<br>
Briefly blend hot kernels then add 175ml boiling water, add 1 tsp salt and 100ml Macadamia oil, blend on high speed 5 minutes, stop and scrape.<br>
Dissolve 1½ tsp honey in 175ml hot water, add to mix and blend on high speed for 15 minutes.<br>
Scrape, mix, remove and chill, may be froen for storage, must be labelled with date and batch.<br>
