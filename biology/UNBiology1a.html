<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.5.2.7H">9.5.2.7</a> Buttercup flower,<br>
 Ranunculus ficaria, Ranunculaceae, Buttercup family<br>
<a href="../images/9.3.2.jpg">See diagram 9.3.2</a>: Buttercup flower<br>
 Note the number, arrangement, shape and colour of each set of organs, i.e. sepals, petals, stamens and carpels, then dissect the flower.<br>
 Note the five separate petals that are yellow, sometimes white.<br>
 Note that the sepals are pale green, boat-shaped, and covered, on the outside with hairs.<br>
 The petals are yellow, larger than the sepals, heart shaped, and each bears a nectary at its base as a cup-like scale at the base.<br>
 Buttercup flowers have numerous stamens with slender, yellow anthers surrounding the green centre.<br>
 Each stamen is divided into two main portions, the filament and the anther head, whereas the carpels are free and each is composed of an ovary, a style and stigma.<br>
 That green centre is composed of a cluster of several distinct, unconnected pistils, which will develop into small, dry achenes.<br>
Experiments<br>
 Draw a half flower diagram to show the relative positions of the various organs of each whorl as they are set upon the receptacle.<br>
 Draw a longitudinal section to shows only those organs through which the scalpel passes when cutting the flower longitudinally.<br>
 Record the floral formula.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.5.2.9H">9.5.2.9</a> Cherry flower<br>
<a href="../images/9.3.3.jpg">See diagram 9.3.3</a>: Cherry flower<br>
 1. The cherry flower has male and female flowering parts in one flower.<br>
 On the outside are the sepals, then the petals, then the male parts, the stamens.<br>
 The female part, pistil, is in the middle of the flower.<br>
 A flower that contains both female and male parts is called a hermaphrodite.<br>
Experiment<br>
 Hold a cherry flower by the stem and detach all the individual parts with tweezers.<br>
 Begin with the outer parts of the flower and work inwards.<br>
 Finally, cut off the part of the stem in the middle of the flower.<br>
 Put similar parts in groups and arrange the groups on the table in the order in which you detached the parts from the flower.<br>
 The first group are the sepals.<br>
 They form the calyx that protects the bud before blossoming.<br>
 Note their colour, shape and number.<br>
 The second group are the petals.<br>
 They form the corolla, protecting the inner parts of the flower and attract insects.<br>
 Note their colour, shape and number.<br>
 The third group are the stamens.<br>
 Note their colour, shape and number.<br>
 Use a magnifying glass to see a thin stalk, the filament, with an anther on top that contains the pollen.<br>
 The last part cut away from the stem is the pistil.<br>
 The pistil has of three sections.<br>
 The convex lower section, adjoining the stem, is the ovary, which merges into the style at the upper end.<br>
 The tip of the style is called the stigma.<br>
2. Study a cherry blossom with the naked eye and then under a magnifier.<br>
 Note the following:<br>
 2.1 The small, green, outer leaves, called the sepals that form the calyx, which protects the flower bud before it opens.<br>
 2.2 The white petals that form the corolla protect the inner parts of the flower and attract insects.<br>
3. The stamens, on and above the petals.<br>
 Each stamen consists of a small thin stalk, the filament, on which the anther is mounted.<br>
 The stamens are the male parts of the flower.<br>
 The anthers contain the pollen.<br>
4. The pistil is in the centre of the flower.<br>
 It consists of three sections:<br>
* The bulbous, lower section, which adjoins the stalk of the flower, called the ovary.<br>
* The style is attached to the upper end of the ovary.<br>
* The upper end of the style forms the stigma.<br>
 The pistil is the female part of the flower.<br>
5. Observe how the various parts of the flower are arranged and are related to each other.<br>
Separate all the parts of the flower at their points of attachment.<br>
 Use forceps, starting at the outside.<br>
 Put similar parts together on a black piece of cardboard.<br>
 Write the names next to the rows of the various parts of the flower.<br>
 Study other flowers in the same way, e.g. columbine, primrose, dog rose, snapdragon and apple blossom.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.3.3.1H">9.3.3.1</a> Cherry seed<br>
 The cherry has a seed with a very hard shell in the middle of the fruit called the stone.<br>
 The plum, apricot and peach are also stone fruit.<br>
 The name "cherry pip" is also used colloquially, but is not technically correct.<br>
 The stone of the stone fruits, like the core of the pip fruits, is surrounded by fruit pulp enclosed in a skin.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.5.2.8H">9.5.2.8</a> Chilli flower<br>
<a href="../images/54.9.2.gif">See diagram 54.9.2</a>: Chilli flower.<br>
 For this lesson you will need chilli flowers, one for two students, and razor blades.<br>
 You will also need a chilli fruit.<br>
 Before the lesson, practice cutting a half flower.<br>
 To do this hold the flower upside down and cut down the middle of the stalk between two of the sepals and cut the flower in half.<br>
 Now check that the stigma, style and ovary are cut exactly in half.<br>
 You will need a magnifying glass to see all the ovules in the ovary.<br>
 Can you count them? Give a flower to each pair of students.<br>
 Name each part of the flower as you point to them.<br>
 Show the students how to cut a half flower.<br>
 Touch each part of the half flower.<br>
 Students should also touch each part of their half flower and tell you is name and function:<br>
 6. Stalk<br>
 5. Receptacle: platform for other parts<br>
 1. Sepals: protect flower bud<br>
 2. Petals: attract insects<br>
 4a. Stigma: female part, pollen sticks to it<br>
 4b. Style: pollen grows down it<br>
 4c. Ovary: pollen fertilizes it to form a fruit<br>
 7. Ovule: pollen fertilizes it to form seed<br>
 3b. Filament: part of male stamen, holds up anther part<br>
 3a. Anther: part of male stamen, produces pollen<br>
 8. Pollen: can fertilize the ovary and ovules to produce fruit and seed.<br>
 After fertilization, sepals, petals, stamens, stigma, and style usually die and fall off.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.5.2.10H">9.5.2.10</a> Hazel flower, Corylus avellana, Betulaceae<br>
<a href="../images/9.3.4.jpg">See diagram 9.3.4</a>: Hazel flower and catkin<br>
 The hazel flower is either male or female.<br>
 The male flowers are grouped in catkins, and the female flowers are in the buds with the clusters of red threads.<br>
 The two types of hazel flower are found on different parts of the same bush.<br>
 In the spring find a hazel bush twig with catkins, which are already flexible and loose.<br>
Experiment<br>
 Hold the twig over a hard dark surface and hit the catkins with a glass rod.<br>
 The yellow dust that falls is pollen, so the catkins are male flowers.<br>
 The male parts of a flower are the stamens with filaments and anthers.<br>
 The female part is the pistil with ovary, style and stigma.<br>
 To see whether the male and the female parts are in hazel catkins use a magnifier to examine the most wide open catkin.<br>
 On the flexible stem of the catkin are very many small leaf-like scales.<br>
 They stand out from the stem of the catkin like small rooftops.<br>
 In addition to the catkins there are also buds on the twigs of the hazel bush with a bundle of fine red thread on their tips.<br>
 Use tweezers and a dissecting needle to remove the small leaves and the scales, which enclose the bud.<br>
 Inside there are several green scale-like small leaves.<br>
 To one side on the lower edge there are two small egg-shaped structures, the ovaries.<br>
 The style and stigma of these ovaries are divided and are the red threads that jut out from the bud.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.5.2.11H">9.5.2.11</a> Hibiscus flower<br>
<a href="Hibiscus.jpg">See diagram</a> Hibiscus flower<br>
Hibiscus flower is a large red flower with five sepals, five red petals, many stamens attached to a red tube separate from the style that is inside it, five stigmas and so five female parts.<br>
The flower does not usually produce seed.<br>

<a href="../images/9.98.10.gif">See diagram 9.9.10</a> Lilium pollen grain<br>
 1. Lilium has a deeply bilobed anther with each lobe containing two microsporangia, pollen sacs.<br>
 The wall of the pollen sacs contains a outer epidermis layer and an inner layer of nutritive cells, the tapetum, which transfers nutrients to the forming pollen.<br>
 Inside the microsporangia are many diploid microsporophytes, pollen mother cells.<br>
 Each microsporophyte divides by meiosis to form a tetrad of four haploid microspores.<br>
 Each microspore divides by mitosis to form a generative cell and a tube cell.<br>
 The microspore is now a pollen grain, the male gametophyte.<br>
 The generative cell divides to form to nuclei to fertilize the ovary and form the endosperm.<br>
 The tube cell forms the pollen tube.<br>
Experiment<br>
 Examine specimens of a large simple flower, lily.<br>
 Count the stamens and observe how they are arranged about the central pistil.<br>
 Make large diagrams of the essential organs.<br>
 Label the parts of the pistil (stigma, style and ovary).<br>
 Label the parts of the stamen (filament and anther).<br>
 The end of the stalk on which the flower grows is called the receptacle.<br>
 At the base of the receptacle there are usually leaf-like structures that enclose the bud.<br>
 These are called sepals.<br>
 Above the sepals there is usually a ring of brightly coloured petals called the corolla.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.5.2.13H">9.5.2.13</a> Poinciana flower<br>
<a href="../images/Poinciana.jpg">See diagram</a> Poinciana flower<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.5.2.15H">9.5.2.15</a> Willow flower<br>
<a href="../images/9.3.7.jpg">See diagram 9.3.7</a>: Willow branch and catkin<br>
 Collect willow branches with catkins beginning to open.<br>
 Willows have two types of catkins:<br>
1. oval-shaped or round and, pale to bright golden yellow and 2. oblong, cylindrical, greenish colour.<br>
 Note whether both types of catkin occur on one branch or on the same tree.<br>
 Study an oval-shaped catkin by cutting longitudinally with a razor blade and using a magnifying glass.<br>
 It contains many stamens, which sit in pairs on a hairy leaf scale (bract).<br>
 They form the male (or pollen) flower.<br>
 Study an oblong, greenish catkin by cutting longitudinally with a razor blade and using a magnifying glass.<br>
 Observe the many bottle-shaped greenish structures, the pistils (the female flower organs).<br>
 Each pistil sits on a hairy leaf scale (bract).<br>
 In the hazel tree male and female flowers are separate, but on the same bush.<br>
Sex differentiated plants on which both male and female flowers are found on the same plant are called monoecious plants.<br>
Sex differentiated plants in which the male and female flowers are found in different plants are called dioecious plants.<br>
 Some dioecious plants possess fruits that can be eaten, e.g. sea buckthorn.<br>
 Its fruits are very rich in vitamin c and give a pleasant tasting juice.<br>
 When a plant flowers differs between species.<br>
 Anemones, primroses, cherry trees and apple trees flower in spring.<br>
 Larkspurs, roses and carnations flower in summer.<br>
 Dahlias and chrysanthemums flower in autumn.<br>
 Christmas rose flowers in winter.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.5.2.4H">9.5.2.4</a> Monoecious, dioecious and hermaphrodite plants<br>
 Male and female gametes may be on the same flower or on different flowers.<br>
 Hermaphrodite, bisexual, perfect flowers have male and female organs.<br>
 Complete flowers have male and female organs and petals and sepals.<br>
 Monoecious plants have separate male and female flowers on the same plant, e.g. maize Zea mays.<br>
 Dioecious plants have separate male and female flowers on separate plants, so they have male plants and female plants, e.g. holly, ginkgo, persimmon<br>

 <a href="../images/9.98.gif">See diagram 9.98</a>: VS Dicotyledon flower.<br>
Experiment<br>
 Hold the flower by the stalk and touch the following parts:<br>
 1. Receptacle: Where the stalk gets wider at the base of the flower.<br>
 It is a platform for the other flower parts.<br>
 2. Sepals: Like little green leaves on the outside of the flower.<br>
 They project the young flower in a flower bud.<br>
 3. Petals: Coloured parts inside the sepals.<br>
 They attract insects.<br>
 4. Stamens: The male parts.<br>
 Each stamen consists of a little stick called the filament that holds up a bag called the anther.<br>
 The anthers produce pollen.<br>
 Can you see the pollen coming out of the anthers?<br>
 5. Stigma: The top of the female part in the middle of the flower.<br>
 It is sticky and can catch the pollen.<br>
 6. Style: The long tube of the female part below the stigma.<br>
 Pollen can grow down inside the tube to fertilize the ovary.<br>
 7. Ovary: The swollen base of the female part that contains ovules.<br>
 After fertilization, the ovary will form a fruit and the ovules will form seeds.<br>
 Count the number of sepals, petals and stamens.<br>
 Then they should pull off some sepals and petals, and open the ovary to see the ovules.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.5.2.6H">9.5.2.6</a> Flower and fruit formation of tomato<br>
<a href="../images/9.4.2.gif">See diagram 9.4.2</a>: Tomato flower and fruit formation<br>
 Collect some green tomatoes and tomato flowers, one of each for each group of four students.<br>
 You could also use chilli or eggplant (aubergine) fruit and flowers.<br>
 You will need some razor blades and a magnifying glass.<br>
 Examine the flowers and fruit, cut them down the middle with razor blades.<br>
 BE CAREFUL! Show them the ovary (fruit) and ovules (seed).<br>
 The remains of the sepals, petals, stamens, stigma, style, may be seen if they have not dropped off.<br>
 After pollen sticks to the stigma and grows down the style into the ovary, the ovary swells to form a fruit.<br>
 The ovules in the ovary become seeds.<br>
 Pollination is when the pollen touches the stigma and sticks to it.<br>
 Big flowers are pollinated by insects.<br>
 Small flowers such as grass are pollinated by the wind.<br>
 Fertilization is when the male pollen reaches the ovary and ovules.<br>
 The pollen grows down the style to the ovary.<br>
 Tell the students to draw their cut tomato flowers and fruit.<br>
 After fertilization, the flower stalk becomes the fruit stalk, the sepals, petals, stamens, stigma and style usually die, the ovary becomes the fruit, the ovules become seed.<br>

 A flower grows from the axil of scale leaf or bract and represents a modified shoot.<br>
 The flower stalk, pedicel, forms a receptacle as a base for the flower parts arranged in concentric whorls or in spirals.<br>
 Flowers may be hermaphrodite with both stamens and carpels or have only stamens or only carpels.<br>
 The perianth (P) is usually in two whorls, but may be absent.<br>
 The outer whorl of the perianth, the calyx (K), contains the leaf-like sepals that protect the bud.<br>
 The inner whorl of the perianth, the corolla (C), contains the petals that are usually showy, coloured and scented to attract insects.<br>
 The male part, the androecium (A) refers to the stamens that produce pollen and are arranged inside the corolla.<br>
 The female part, the gynoecium (G) or pistil, refers to the carpels in the centre of the flower.<br>
 The carpels contain the ovules that form seeds after fertilization.<br>
 Fruits develop from the carpels, and sometimes other structures.<br>
 The floral formula shows the number of parts in the calyx (K) corolla C) androecium (A) and gynoecium (G).<br>
 Perianth (P) is used when no separate calyx and corolla exist.<br>
 The symbol "oo" (infinity) stands for a large and indefinite number of parts.<br>
 Fusion between parts is shown by brackets round the number, e.g. K(5) = fusion of 5 sepals (K 5 means 5 separate sepals).<br>
Experiments<br>

 Plants can bear flowers singly or grouped in an inflorescence.<br>
 Each flower usually has its own stalk, the pedicel.<br>
 Where the pedicels join the main stalk, the peduncle, is a bract.<br>
 A spadix is a fleshy spike covered with male and female flowers, e.g. arum lily.<br>

 1. Each flower usually has its own stalk, the pedicel.<br>
 Where the pedicels join the main stalk, the peduncle, is a bract.<br>
 2. A spike is a simple axis with successively younger sessile flowers, so it has no pedicels, e.g. Gladiolus, red clover.<br>
 3. A catkin is a unisexual spike without petals that usually hangs down, e.g. mulberry, willow, oak, birch<br>
 4. A spadix is a fleshy spike covered with male and female flowers, e.g. arum lily.<br>
 5. A raceme is similar to a spike, but the flowers have pedicels, e.g. sweet pea.<br>
 6. A panicle is an open, repeatedly branched raceme bearing many flowers, e.g. oats and other grasses.<br>
 7. A corymb is a raceme with all flowers at one level with the youngest flower in the centre, e.g. apple, rowan, hawthorn.<br>
 8. An umbel has flower stalks all arising together at the end of the main stalk, e.g. carrot, parsley, fennel, frangipani, Hydrangea, Lantana.<br>
 9. A capitulum (head), has flowers densely packed on a receptacle with the youngest at the centre, e.g. sunflower, dandelion, daisy.<br>
 10. A cyme has the main axis ending in a flower, the oldest flower, with younger flowers on lateral branches, e.g. tomato.<br>
 11. A spathe is a huge bract that can enclose the inflorescence, e.g. coconut.<br>

 1. Dispersal by animals<br>
 Birds eat fleshy parts of blackberry or cherry drupes, but not the hard seeds protected by a hard endocarp.<br>
 Birds are irritated by the sticky receptacle of mistletoe fruit, so it wipes the fruit on branches.<br>
 Animals carry hooked fruits, burs, in their coats, e.g. capitulum of common burdock covered by spiny bracts.<br>
 The weed cobbler's pegs has toothed bristles that attach the fruit to your socks.<br>
2. Dispersal by wind<br>
 Dandelion, thistle and other Compositae have a ring of white hairs, pappus, to form a parachute and carry the achene.<br>
 Seeds of willow have tufted hairs.<br>
 Poppy has a pepper-pot mechanism to shake out tiny seeds from its capsule.<br>
 Similarly Eucalyptus and Leptospermum have a capsule that opens by slits.<br>
 The fruit of the castor bean, Ricinus communis, suddenly split apart to throw out seeds.<br>
 Clematis and wood avens have plumed fruit.<br>
 The elm tree and the ash tree have winged fruit.<br>
 Orchids have extremely light seeds.<br>
 Spinifex and various "tumble weeds" produce a ball-like cluster of fruits to be bowled along by the wind.<br>
3. Dispersal by water<br>
 Water lily seeds and fruit can float.<br>
 Also, coconut fruits can float, but they may not be viable after some time.<br>
 4. Mechanical dispersal<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.5.4.1H">9.5.4.1</a> Pollen<br>
 1. The stamens are attached to the receptacle inside the corolla and outside the carpels.<br>
 Each stamen consists of a filament like a little stem and terminal anther that produces pollen.<br>
 The anther has of four sporangia, each occupying a lobe.<br>
 The sporangia are held together by parenchyma tissue with a small vascular bundle called the connective.<br>
 An adnate anther is fused to the filament, Ranunculus.<br>
 A versatile anther swings loosely at the end of the filament, lily.<br>
 Most anthers open by a longitudinal slit down each side so that the pollen from the two contiguous sporangia is shed simultaneously.<br>
 Some anthers shed pollen by terminal pores.<br>
 A transverse section of a young anther shows four locules or sporangia, two on each side of the connective with its vascular bundle.<br>
 Each sporangium has an epidermal layer of cells with a thin cuticle, a fibrous layer of cells, parenchyma cells, and a tapetum, composed of a single layer of cells with large nuclei and dense contents and.<br>projecting into the sporangium.<br>
 The tapetum nourishes the pollen-mother-cells (spore-mother-cells) inside that have thick walls, dense cytoplasm, and a large nucleus.<br>
 As the anther matures, each diploid pollen-mother-cell divides by meiosis to form four haploid pollen grains.<br>
 The walls of the pollen-mother-cells breakdown to release the pollen grains.<br>
 Dehiscence occurs between the two contiguous sporangia where the cells have thin walls and readily split apart under tension when the cells of the fibrous layer contract.<br>
 The split extends down each side of the anther to liberate the dry pollen grains.<br>
Weatherzone Pollen Index<br>
In Brisbane, the Weatherzone Pollen Index measures the potential for pollen to trigger allergic reactions in susceptible people.<br>
Pollen levels in the atmosphere will be highest on hot days and on days where a dry wind is blowing.<br>
Additionally, light rain overnight or during the early morning will also cause high pollen levels.<br>
Pollen allergy<br>
These are the days when you will experience the telltale symptoms of a runny nose, watery eyes, itchy skin and nasal congestion.<br>
Some people are allergic to honey, e.g. dandelion honey, because of the pollen it contains.<br>
Honey may be sold coming from different flowers, e.g. karri, white clover or as a blend.<br>
So blended honey sold in markets may not contain pollen, because they are filtered.<br>
Testing different honey for allergies to them may be too dangerous for school science experiments.<br>
Experiment<br>
Pollen carried by wind can be taken to very high altitudes or hundreds of kilometres, but most pollen is carried small distances.<br>
To test distance, select a plant that sheds lots of pollen with a distinctive shape and where there are no other plants of this species in the area, e.g. a pine tree on a farm, Juncus rush where there are no other rushes.<br>
Expose slides coated with Vaseline for one day or use a pollen sampler containing pre-greased polystyrene rods.<br>
A thin coat of silicone grease captures the pollen and mould spores on the rod.<br>

<a href="../images/9.98.3.gif">See diagram 9.98.3</a>: Lily pollen grain<br>
 Each pollen grain contains a small generative cell and a large tube cell.<br>
 Pollen grains shed from the anthers are carried by wind or by insects to a stigma, the receptive part of the gynoecium.<br>
 Germination of the pollen is induced by the secretion from the stigma.<br>
 The large tube cell divides to form the pollen tube that grows through pores in the wall of the pollen grain then grows down through the style tissue to reach the ovary.<br>
 The small generative cell divides to form two male cells that function as gametes and may seem naked nuclei.<br>
 As the pollen tube emerges from the pollen grain, the tube nucleus passes to the tip of the pollen tube leaving behind the two male cells.<br>
 The pollen tube and its two small cells represent the male prothallus found in more primitive plant forms, liverworts, mosses, ferns and conifers.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.5.4.5H">9.5.4.5</a> Brownian motion<br>
<a href="../commercial/Commercial.html#Brownian">Brownian Motion</a> (Commercial)<br>
1. Brownian motion, (Brownian movement), was named after Robert Brown, (1773-1858, Scotland), the botanist employed by Sir Joseph Banks, (1743-1820), on the voyage of the Investigator to Australia in 1801.<br>
Robert Brown published his observations in 1827.<br>
He had noticed the jittery random movement of pollen grains thought to be caused by the pollen grains themselves.<br>
However, he showed that similar random movement could also be seen if any solid material of similar size was observed.<br>
A small particle suspended in a liquid executes a haphazard zigzag movement, because of the uneven buffeting from the molecules of liquid that bombard it.<br>
This random movement of microscopic particles suspended in a liquid or gas is caused by an instantaneous imbalance of combined impact forces of solution molecules on much larger irregularly-shaped solute particles.<br>
In 1905, Albert Einstein was fascinated by this movement.<br>
He wrote, "The existence of a never diminishing motion seems contrary to all experience.<br>
This difficulty was splendidly clarified by the kinetic theory of matter".<br>
His statistical calculations of the mass and number of molecules involved, lead to the final acceptance of the atomic theory by scientists.<br>
2. In investigating the pollen of different plants, Robert Brown, in 1828, observed that this became dispersed in water in a great number of small particles, which were perceived to be in uninterrupted and irregular "swarming" motion.<br>
As the phenomenon repeated itself with all possible kinds of organic substances, he believed that he had found in these particles the "primitive molecule" of living matter.<br>
He found later that the particles of every kind of inorganic substance presented the same phenomenon, so that he drew the conclusion that all matter was built up of "primitive molecules.".<br>
3. Albert Einstein's "simple theory of this phenomenon" was to review from consideration of diffusion and osmotic pressure, and diffusion and irregular motion of molecules, and movement of the single molecules, using van 't Hoff's law, Maxwell's law of distribution of velocities and Stokes' law, (Zeit. f. Elektrochemie, 14, 1908, pp. 235-239).<br>
Before Einstein's mathematical treatment of the problem, different scientists noted that the motion was caused by | irregular heating | incident light| and persisted unchanged for a whole year when the liquid was sealed up between two cover glasses | is most rapid with the smallest particles| is increased ultraviolet light and heat rays | has its origin in the impacts of the molecules of the liquid on the particles | is the more lively the smaller the viscosity of the liquid | is caused by the thermal molecular motions of the liquid | the velocity of the movement decreases with increase of size of the particles and increases with rise of temperature|.<br>
Also, the motion is not caused by forces exerted by the particles on one another, temperature differences, evaporation, electrical forces intensity of illumination, strong, electromagnetic fields.<br>
4. Einstein explained that the pollen grains are buffeted by collisions with molecules of water moving randomly in all directions<br>
Einstein's theory and Perrin's observations showed that the mean distance travelled by a pollen grain is subject to random collisions increases as the square root or time distance x time t, whereas in straight line motion, x t<br>
5. To give direct confirmation of Einstein's formula photographs of cinnabar particles at intervals of 0.1 second showed that the average displacement was inversely proportional to the viscosity<br>
Jean Baptiste Perrin, 1870-1942, France, and his students verified Einstein's explanation of this phenomenon<br>
The method was to prepare a suspension of gamboge or mastic with particles of exactly equal to be enclosed in a microscopic chamber<br>
The distribution in height of the particles was determined, after equilibrium had been established, by counting in the microscope the particles in different layers above the bottom of the chamber<br>
A small screen in the ocular of the microscope allowed only a few particles in the field of vision, so a great number of observations were arranged for different sizes of particles<br>
With the acceptance of the explanations for Brownian motion the existence of atoms and molecules became accepted<br>
Also, Perrin calculated the value for Avogadro's number, the number of atoms in a mole<br>
Experiments<br>
1. Put a drop of toothpaste on a microscope slide and stir water into it until it is almost colourless.<br>
Put a coverslip over the drop and examine it with a microscope under high power with the stage illuminated from the side.<br>
Pay attention to one particle.<br>
At first it appears to stay in one place.<br>
Later you can see that it is moving with an irregular jerky movement in all directions.<br>
The irregular movement is caused by molecules of water hitting unevenly on the sides of the particle.<br>
This experiment does not work with the modern "gel" type of toothpaste.<br>
2. Make a model using a tray containing many small, light beads and one large marble.<br>
The small beads represent molecules of water and the large marble represents a particle of suspended graphite.<br>
Shake the tray and note how the small beads hit the marble from all directions.<br>
The forces tend to cancel so the large marble may just make very small irregular movements, but returns to the same place.<br>
3. Observe dirty water in sunlight.<br>
Fill a beaker with tap water and focus sunlight into the beaker with a magnifying glass.<br>
You may see the motions of suspended particles of solid matter.<br>
4. Observe smoke in still air.<br>
The smoke particles suspended in the air show Brownian movement.<br>
Use a microscope to observe the movement of particles in a smoke cell.<br>

<a href="../images/9.98.5.gif">See diagram 9.98.5</a>: Lily ovule<br>
Carpels<br>
The carpels appear in the centre of the flower, and usually end the growth of the floral axis.<br>
Together, the carpels form the gynoecium (pistil).<br>
An apocarpous gynoecium has separate carpels, Ranunculus.<br>
A syncarpous gynoecium has fused carpels. lily 3 fused carpels.<br>
The gynoecium of legumes is a single carpel.<br>
Each carpel consists of three parts:<br>
1. The ovary at the base contains the ovules.<br>
2. The style is an extension of the ovary.<br>
3. The stigma at the end of the style secretes a sticky, sugary fluid to catch the pollen grains.<br>
Ovule<br>
The ovule consists of a mass of cells, the nucellus (megasporangium), surrounded by two rings of tissue, the integuments.<br>
Megaspores<br>
The nucellus develops the diploid megaspore-mother-cell, which divides by meiosis to form four haploid megaspores, while the megaspore-mother-cell becomes a large oval cell called the embryo sac.<br>
Of the four megaspores in a row in the embryo sac, only the megaspore nearest the food supply and farthest from the micropyle survives, because it crushes and absorbs its three sister megaspores.<br>
The surviving megaspore divides by three mitosis divisions to form the eight nuclei of the embryo sac (2 synergids, 1 ovum, 3 antipodals, 2 polar nuclei).<br>
At the micropyle end of the embryo sac are three nuclei or cells surrounded by cytoplasm with thin membranes.<br>
Two of these cells are pear shaped and called the synergids.<br>
Ovum<br>
The third cell is the globular ovum.<br>
At the other end of the embryo sac are three cells called the antipodals.<br>
In the centre of the embryo sac is the large fusion nucleus formed by the fusion of two polar nuclei.<br>
The embryo sac that represents the female prothallus is still surrounded by cells of the nucellus.<br>
Placentation<br>
Placentation refers to how the ovules are attached to the placenta in the ovary.<br>
 1. Parietal placentation is where the ovules are attached to the wall of the ovary, poppy.<br>
 2. Axile placentation is where the ovules are attached to the central axis of a multilocular ovary, lily.<br>
 3. Free central placentation is where the ovules are attached to the axis, but the ovary is unilocular, primula.<br>
 The stigma is hollow or contains loose mucilage secreting cells to help the pollen tubes reach the ovarian cavity.<br>
 The pollen tube probably absorbs nutrients from this style tissue in flowers with long styles.<br>
Experiment<br>
Cut sections of ovules.<br>
 Take a just-opened flower of marsh marigold and remove the sepals and petals.<br>
Harden the group of carpels in alcohol and then cut transverse sections of these.<br>
Cut many sections and pick out a few thin ones which have traversed an ovule and mount in glycerine.<br>
These will give longitudinal sections of the ovules, which can be compared with the figures in the text.<br>
Transverse sections of syncarpous ovaries should also be cut, tulip and lily.<br>

To study seeds in a later stage of development, put the swollen seeds in a flowerpot filled with damp sawdust or sand.<br>
When the plants have reached the desired stage of growth, remove them from the sawdust or sand and rinse under water.<br>
Open the carpels of embryo plants at different ages, e.g. shepherd's purse.<br>

Put a coverslip over them and press down on the coverslip with a thumb wrapped in absorbent paper or a scalpel handle to squeeze the embryos out of the ovules.<br>
Be careful not to break the coverslip, because the broken pieces are very sharp.<br>

<a href="../images/9.98.6.gif">See diagram 9.98.6</a>: Lily fertilization<br>
The end of the pollen tube in the cavity of the ovary, enters the micropyle, penetrates the nucellus tissue, enters the embryo sac and bursts to set free its two male gamete cells.<br>
One male gamete unites with the ovum to form the zygote, the essential act of fertilization.<br>
The other male gamete cell unites with the fusion nucleus to form the primary endosperm nucleus or triple fusion nucleus.<br>
The synergids and antipodals shrivel and die.<br>
In angiosperms, the endosperm develops only after fertilization.<br>
The triple fusion nucleus divides to form thin walled parenchyma tissue that accumulates food reserves, starch, oil and protein.<br>
As the endosperm develops, it crushes the nucellus.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.4.5.5H">9.4.5.5</a> Zygote development<br>
The zygote forms a firm cellulose wall then divides transversely into a filament of three cells, called the pro-embryo.<br>
The large cell nearest the wall of the embryo sac is the base cell that attaches the embryo to the wall.<br>
The middle cell is the suspensor initial that divides transversely to form a short filament called the suspensor.<br>
The uppermost cell is the embryonic cell.<br>
As it is towards the centre of the endosperm, it is nearer its food supply and can divide frequently to form the greater part of the embryo.<br>
The embryonic cell divides by a transverse wall and then by two longitudinal walls at right angles to each other, to form the octants.<br>
Each octant then divides by walls parallel to the surface (periclinal), into an outer and inner cell.<br>
The superficial layer later divides only by walls at right angles to the surface (anticlinal), forming the dermatogen, which produces the epidermis.<br>
The inner cells divide periclinally, so that inner and outer series of cells are formed.<br>
In the lower part of the embryo, this segmentation is much more regular than in the upper half the lower forms the hypocotyl and root, while the upper forms the cotyledons (seed leaves) and plumule, (terminal bud).<br>
The central cells are the plerome, which produces the stele tissues, while the outer series is the periblem and produces the cortex.<br>
The uppermost cell of the suspensor is the hypophysis, which forms the root apex by division.<br>
Between the two cotyledons the small plumule arises at the base of the groove between them and terminates the hypocotyl.<br>
The hypocotyl and radicle with its root cap, have all developed from the embryo initial and the hypophysis of the pro-embryo.<br>
The greater part of the embryo, however, arises from the embryo initial.<br>
In monocotyledons, a pro-embryo of three primary cells is formed as in dicotyledons.<br>
However, only one cotyledon appears terminal on the hypocotyl, while the plumule arises laterally.<br>

Use a magnifying glass to examine the collection of carpels of the buttercup, when they have ripened after fertilization, thus forming a collection of fruit.<br>
Each fruit is an achene.<br>
Dissect one and find the single seed enclosed.<br>
Compare and contrast a ripe strawberry with the collection of buttercup fruits, e.g. sunflower, buttercup, clematis, coreopsis, dahlia, marigold, zinnia.<br>

<a href="../images/9.113.4.gif">See diagram 9.113.4</a>: Maize kernel (caryopsis)<br>
Caryopsis, "grain": single carpel so a single seed is tightly closed in the ovary wall, indehiscent, pericarp fused with thin seed coat, e.g. maize (corn), wheat.<br>
The seed coat is fused with the fruit coat.<br>
A caryopsis usually has 1. a carpel, ovary wall, pericarp and 2. a seed coat, testa, fused together, e.g. cereals, grasses, wheat, maize, rice.<br>

Popcorn, pericarp of maize, Zea mays, subspecies mays, flint corn<br>
Heat 3 tablespoons (45 mL) of high smoke point oil, e.g. canola, peanut or grape seed oil, vegetable oil in a 3-quart saucepan on a medium high heat stove until it is very hot, but not smoking.<br>
Add three or four popcorn kernels to the oil and cover the saucepan.<br>
If they pop then the oil is hot enough to add 1/3 of a cup of popcorn kernels and immediately close the lid.<br>
Remove the saucepan from the heated stove and wait for 30 seconds to bring all the kernels to a "ready to pop" temperature.<br>
Return the saucepan to the heated stove.<br>
The kennels immediately start popping.<br>
Shake the saucepan to avoid burning the kernels and move the lid slightly to allow steam to escape.<br>
When the popping almost ceases dump the popcorn into a bowl.<br>
As the kernel gets hotter, water inside the pericarp vaporizes to turn the starch into a hot gelatinous mass.<br>
With increased internal pressure, the kernel explodes with a popping noise and the starch solidifies intro a fluffy white mass as it leaves the pericarp shell.<br>
Examine any kernels that have not popped.<br>
They usually are very small or have an unusual shape that interferes with the breaking of the pericarp.<br>
The pericarp of popcorn kernels is four times stronger than regular maize kernels<br>

Pod: A dry fruit that opens on two sides to let the seeds out. e.g. legume (cowpea, wing bean, peanut)<br>
 A legume pod is a dry dehiscent fruit with many seeds.<br>
The legume, pea, develops from a single carpel and splits along both margins.<br>
When the pea fruit is ripe, both parts of the pericarp twist to throw the seeds some distance from the parent plant.<br>
When squeezing open a pea pod, you find the many seeds, the peas, lying in a hollow space.<br>
This is also the case with bean pods.<br>
You call such a fruit pod a "fruit".<br>
In legumes the seeds, peas or beans, are suspended in a pod.<br>
With the bean plant, you eat either the entire fruit (green beans as soup, a vegetable or salad) or only the seeds (e.g. bean soup made from white, dried beans).<br>
With the pea, you eat only the seeds in pea soup, green peas as a vegetable or peas pudding.<br>
Some peas can be eaten whole including the pea pod and enclosed seeds.<br>
In France these peas are called "mange tous" (eat all) peas.<br>

 The ovule becomes a seed.<br>
 The ovum (egg) inside the ovule becomes the embryo plant (baby plant).<br>
The calyx, corolla, stamens, stigma and style usually shrivel and fall off.<br>
 The ovary forms a fruit.<br>
 Examine the flowers of a plant and follow the fate of the different parts of the flowers until mature fruit forms.<br>
