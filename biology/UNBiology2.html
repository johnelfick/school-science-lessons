Taste<br>
Relative sweetness of artificial sweeteners, relative sweetness mass for mass, is measured by comparing the taste in water to a 4% solution of cane sugar.<br>
See: Aspartame sweetener.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.6.0H">9.6.0</a> Touch and feeling<br>
Feel and conductivity, (Geology)<br>
Experienced handlers of minerals, e.g. gemstone workers, claim to be able to recognize minerals from the feel against the fingers or the cheek.<br>
For example talc and graphite may feel smooth and greasy, while, (China clay), and chalk feel rough and dry.<br>
Copper feels colder than amber against the cheek, because copper is a better conductor of heat.<br>
Similarly, real gemstones can be distinguished from glass imitations by feel against the cheek.<br>

 Feel of alkalis<br>
 Feel some soap and it feels slippery, because it contains alkalis.<br>
 Prepare very dilute solutions of each sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide and barium hydroxide.<br>
 Moisten your finger tips with each solution and rub your fingers together, and note what you feel.<br>
Wet your finger with the sodium hydroxide solution, feel it between your fingers, then wash them afterwards, and note the "soapy" feel.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.1.1 H">9.1.1 </a> Absolute threshold<br>
 The absolute threshold is the smallest detectable level of a stimulus, (50 % of the time.)<br>
 1. Hearing<br>
 The smallest level of a tone that can be detected by normal hearing when there are no other interfering sounds present, e.g. ticking.<br>
 The quietest sound that children with normal hearing can detect is about 1, 000 Hz.<br>
 2. Vision<br>
 The smallest level of light that a participant can detect, e.g. the distance a participant can detect a candle flame in the dark.<br>
 A human can detects a stimulus as little as 90 photons, after controlling for dark adaptation, wavelength, location and stimulus size.<br>
 3. Smell<br>
 The smallest concentration that a participant can to smell, e.g. the smallest amount of perfume in a large room.<br>
 Two very low odour threshold values:<br>
See: Allyl mercaptan: 6 X 10<sup>7</sup> molecules / mL of air<br>
See: Vanilla, odour threshold value: 2 X 10<sup>9</sup> molecules / mL of air.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.1.2H">9.1.2</a> Deep tendon reflexes<br>
See: Hammers, medical, 3 point, (Modern Teaching Aids), (Commercial)<br>
 To examine deep tendon reflexes, use a reflex hammer (3 point medical hammer) or the side of the hand.<br>
 Note the extent or power of the reflex, visually and by palpation of the tendon or muscle.<br>
 Clonus muscular spasms involving repeated contractions that may be rhythmic.<br>
 A reflex may be rated by 1. Sustained clonus, 2. Very brisk with clonus, 3. More reflexive than normal, 4. Normal, 5. Diminished, 6. Only elicited with reinforcement, 7. No response<br>
 The student sits up on the edge of the table with one hand on top of the other, arms and legs relaxed.<br>
 For reinforcement of the reflex ask the student to clench the teeth.<br>
Experiments<br>
 1. Biceps reflex<br>
 Place your thumb on the student's biceps tendon and strike your thumb with the reflex hammer or the side of the hand.<br>
 Observe the arm movement.<br>
 Repeat and compare with the other arm.<br>
 The biceps reflex is mediated by the C5 and C6 nerve roots.<br>
2. Brachioradialis reflex<br>
 Strike the student's brachioradialis tendon directly with the hammer or the side of the hand when the student's arm is resting.<br>
 Strike the tendon roughly 8 cm above the wrist.<br>
 Note the reflex supination (in the supine position).<br>
 Repeat and compare to the other arm.<br>
 The brachioradialis reflex is mediated by the C5 and C6 nerve roots.<br>
3. Triceps reflex<br>
 Strike the student's the triceps tendon directly with the hammer or the side of the hand while holding the student's arm with your other hand.<br>
 Repeat and compare to the other arm.<br>
 The triceps reflex is mediated by the C6 and C7 nerve roots, predominantly by C7 or reinforcement of the lower extremity reflexes.<br>
Ask the student to hook together their flexed fingers and pull apart.<br>
This is called the Jendrassik manoeuvre.<br>
4. Knee jerk reflex<br>
 With the student's lower leg hanging freely off the edge of the table, strike the student's quadriceps tendon directly with the reflex hammer or side of the hand.<br>
 Repeat and compare to the other leg.<br>
 A normal or brisk knee jerk would have little more than one swing forward and one back.<br>
 The knee jerk reflex is mediated by the L3 and L4 nerve roots, mainly L4.<br>
5. Ankle reflex<br>
 Hold the relaxed foot with one hand and strike the Achilles tendon with the hammer or the side of the hand and note the plantar flexion.<br>
 Compare to the other foot.<br>
 The ankle jerk reflex is mediated by the S1 nerve root.<br>
6. Plantar reflex<br>
 Coarsely run a key or the end of the reflex hammer up the lateral aspect of the foot from heel to big toe.<br>
 The normal reflex is toe flexion.<br>
 If the toes extend and separate, called Babinski's sign, an upper motor neurone lesion affects the lower extremity.<br>
7. Hoffman response<br>
 Hold the student's middle finger between the thumb and index finger.<br>
 Ask the student to relax their fingers completely.<br>
 Once the student is relaxed, using your thumbnail to press down on the student's fingernail and move downward until your nail "clicks" over the end of the student's nail.<br>
 Normally, nothing occurs.<br>
 A positive Hoffman response is when the other fingers flex transiently after the "click".<br>
 Repeat this manoeuvre multiple times on both hands.<br>
 A positive Hoffman response indicates an upper motor neurone lesion affecting the upper extremity.<br>
8. Test for clonus<br>
 If any of the reflexes appeared hyperactive, hold the student's relaxed lower leg in your hand, and sharply dorsiflex the foot and hold it dorsiflexed.<br>
 Feel for oscillations between flexion and extension of the foot indicate clonus.<br>
 Normally, nothing is felt.<br>

 2.1 Autonomic nervous system, ANS, visceral nervous system, involuntary nervous system<br>
 2.1.1 Sympathetic nervous system, SNS, emergency action (fight or flight), parallel action to adrenaline, but more immediate:<br>
 * increases heart rate, blood pressure, breathing rate,<br>
 * dilates the pupil, trachea (lump in throat),<br>
 * contracts hair erector pili muscles, e.g. hair "stands on end", tingling spine feeling, ruffling of cat's fur and chicken's feathers,<br>
 * constricts blood vessels to skin (turned white in fright), salivary glands (dry mouth) constricted,<br>
 * contracts bladder wall. (urination due to fright),<br>
 * inhibits digestion<br>
 2.1.2 Parasympathetic nervous system, PSNS, return to normal after emergency<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.1.4H">9.1.4</a> Reflex arc<br>
 A reflex arc is a simple nerve pathway for reflex actions, e.g. patellar reflex (knee jerk).<br>
 The pathway has a minimum of three neurones:<br>
 1. A sensory neuron exists from a receptor through a spinal nerve and into the spinal cord or brain.<br>
 2. A connector interneuron within the spinal cord.<br>
 2. A motor neurone from the spinal cord and through a motor spinal nerve to a muscle or gland.<br>
 The three neurones are connected by synapses.<br>
 It is a theoretical idea, because nobody has ever dissected out a simple reflex arc!<br>
 A conditioned reflex involves a new response behaviour, e.g. a dog associated the sound a bell with feeding, so when a bell rings, the response is to salivate.<br>
 A reflex reaction is an involuntary response to an internal or external stimulus.<br>
 During sleep, the atonia associated with rapid eye movement (REM) stops messages moving from the brain to the muscles, causing a partial paralysis to stop sleepers moving about.<br>
 For example, sneezing is not possible during sleep in a normal healthy person.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.1.6H">9.1.6</a> Circular movement of foot<br>
 Sit on a chair.<br>
 Lift your right foot off the floor then move it in a clockwise circle.<br>
 While keeping the foot moving in a circle, use the pointing finger of your right hand to draw the number 6 in the air.<br>
 Your right foot changes the direction of circular movement.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.1.7H">9.1.7</a> Hands in hot and cold water<br>
 Use a bowl of warm water, iced water and water with middle temperature.<br>
 1. Hold one hand for one minute in the warm water and hold the other hand for one minute in the iced water.<br>
2. Place both hands in the middle temperature water.<br>
 The previously in the warm water feels cold and the hand previously in the iced water feels warm.<br>
 The experiment shows that temperature sense is relative to the temperature of the skin.<br>
 The skin of the hand placed in the warm water had become warmer and the skin of the hand placed in the iced water had become colder.<br>

 
 <hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.1.8H">9.1.8</a> Hands of sleeper in warm water<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.1.9H">9.1.9</a> Human reaction time<br>
Reaction Timer</a> (recording timer, ticker timer), (Commercial).<br>
<a href="../images/9.249.gif">See diagram 9.249</a>: Reaction time<br>
 If a body falls from a height s, the distance it falls after t seconds = gt<sup>2</sup> /<br>
 2. So if you measure s, you can obtain t, t = 2S / g.<br>
Experiments<br>
 1. Hold metre ruler vertically with the zero on the scale down and the 100 on the zero on the scale up.<br>
 With your arm stretched horizontally, hold the ruler vertically between the thumb and first finger with the lower edge of the first finger at the zero on the scale.<br>
 Open your fingers then close them again as quickly as possible to catch the ruler again.<br>
 Record the distance to the downward edge of your first finger.<br>
 Repeat the experiment and calculate the average distance down the metre stick.<br>
 Use t = 2S / g to calculate the time of the falling ruler, i.e. your reaction time.<br>
2. Repeat the experiment under the following pairs of conditions:<br>
 1. Hold the ruler first with your left hand<br>
 2. Hold the ruler first with your left hand<br>
 3. Talk to others while doing the experiment<br>
 4. Do not talk to others while doing the experiment<br>
 5. Allow loud background music<br>
 6. Do not allow loud background music.<br>
 Try other contrasting conditions to see whether your reaction time is affected.<br>
 Compare results with the results of other students.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.2.1H">9.2.1</a> Mountain sickness and hyperventilation<br>
Persons climbing above 2500 m may experience headaches, nausea and rapid breathing caused by hyperventilation to compensate
 for the low concentration of oxygen above that height.<br>
The condition can be treated by breathing pure oxygen, rest and return to lower altitudes.<br>
After about 7 days the symptoms may disappear.<br>
In most passenger aircraft, the cabin air pressure at 10, 000 metres is about two thirds of normal sea-level pressure.<br>
This lower pressure may cause sealed bags of potato chips to inflate and cause discomfort to passengers with blocked sinuses caused by a heavy cold.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.2.2H">9.2.2</a> Breath, simulated diaphragm breathing<br>
<a href="../images/9.242.2.gif">See diagram 9.242</a>: Simulated diaphragm.<br>
<a href="../images/9.240.gif">See diagram 9.240</a>: VS Lungs and a bronchiole.<br>
 Breathing movements cause the change of air in the lungs necessary for breathing, because the lungs have no muscles and cannot inhale or exhale air by themselves.<br>
Experiments 
1. Breathe deeply in an out.<br>
 Note that the volume of the chest cavity changes in two ways.<br>
 1.1 When you inhale, the thorax expands to produce decreased pressure in the airtight chest cavity that causes air to flow into the lungs.<br>
 When you exhale, the thorax contracts to decrease the size of the chest cavity, compress the elastic lung tissue and force air out of the lungs.<br>
 The thorax rises and falls, because of the action of the muscles between the ribs.<br>
 In this way you can increase breathing to allow stronger bodily activity.<br>
 1.2 In diaphragm breathing, abdominal breathing, the diaphragm rises and falls, because of the action of the diaphragm muscle controlled by the respiratory centre.<br>
 At rest, or during with low bodily activity, breathing acts mainly in this
manner.<br>
2. Show the mechanism of diaphragm breathing.<br>
 Pull a rubber balloon over each of the two ends of the glass Y-tube.<br>
 Smear the ends of the glass tube with glycerine.<br>
 Pass the long limb of the Y-tube from below through the neck of a 5 litre polystyrene large jar and through a hole in a rubber stopper lubricated with glycerine.<br>
 Use a rubber cloth with a loop on one side to close the opening at the base of the large jar so that the loop remains outside.<br>
 Secure the rubber cloth to the large jar with a clamping ring.<br>
 Press the rubber stopper firmly into the neck of the large jar.<br>
 Grab the model by the neck in one hand, and pass the other hand through the loop.<br>
 Move the rubber cloth up and down to simulate the breathing rhythm.<br>
 Draw down the rubber cloth to inflate the balloons.<br>
 Push the rubber cloth upwards to collapse the balloons.<br>
 If the rubber cloth is drawn downwards, the volume in the large jar outside the rubber balloons increases.<br>
 A decrease in pressure occurs that is immediately equalized by the flow of air into the elastic balloons, so they expand.<br>
 When you press the rubber cloth upwards, the volume in the large jar outside the rubber balloons decreases to produce excess 
 pressure that forces air out of the elastic balloons that then collapse.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.2.3H">9.2.3</a> Breath volume<br>
<a href="../images/9.241.gif">See diagram 9.241</a>: Volume of air in a breath.<br>
 1. Fix a glass tube bent at right angles through a one-hole stopper.<br>
 Push the stopper into the neck of a large jar.<br>
 Immerse the large jar in the water of a fish tank.<br>
 Connect one end of rubber tubing to the glass tube.<br>
 Suck out the residual air in the large jar with a rubber bulb.<br>
 Close the stopcock and raise the large jar by 10 cm.<br>
 Connect the other end of the rubber tubing to a glass mouthpiece.<br>
 Take a few normal breaths, in through the nose and out through the mouth.<br>
 Blow breaths of air into the large jar.<br>
 If two litres of air are blown into the large jar with 6 breaths, the volume
of air expelled per breath is 330 mL.<br>
2. Normal breathing exchanges 200 to 500 mL of air at each breath.<br>
 Vigorous inhaling and exhaling exchange 2.5 to 5 litres of air at each breath.<br>
 This value is called the vital capacity, measured with a spirometer.<br>
 After the most powerful exhalation, about 1 000 mL of air is left in the lungs, the residual air.<br>
 The vital capacity + the residual capacity = the total volumetric capacity of the lungs.<br>
 Measure the vital capacity with a method similar to that used for measuring the volume of air in one breath.<br>
 Breathe in as much air as possible.<br>
 Place the glass mouthpiece in the mouth and attempt to blow all the air out of the lungs with one breath into the large jar.<br>
 3. Use the rubber bulb to pass air through limewater.<br>
 The limewater does not turn milky.<br>
 Immerse the large jar in the water and dip the mouthpiece into limewater so that the air bubbles through the limewater.<br>
 The limewater has turned milky, showing the presence of carbon dioxide in exhaled air.<br>
4. Measure the volume of air breathed out.<br>
 Take a deep breath.<br>
 Blow air out slowly into one jar until all the water has been pushed out.<br>
 Transfer to the next jar and blow more air out until the lungs are empty.<br>
 For example, the volume of the air in a student's lungs may be 1 000 cm + 1 000 cm + 200 cm = 2 200 cm.<br>
 Make air replace water by blowing air into inverted jars filled with water.<br>
 Estimate the volume of the lungs by measuring the volume of air pushed out.<br>
 Be careful! Do not let students blow so hard that they feel sick.<br>
 5. Measure chest expansion.<br>
 Use a tape measure to measure the perimeter of the chest where it is widest.<br>
 Note the chest measurement after breathing out.<br>
 Note the chest measurement after breathing in.<br>
 Calculate the chest expansion.<br>
 Measure again after breathing really hard out and in.<br>
 Observe the movement of the ribs when breathing in.<br>
 Stand up and push one finger into the stomach, up and under the lower rib.<br>
 Then breathe in.<br>
 The diaphragm muscle pushes the finger down.<br>
 The volume of the chest increases when the ribs move up like the handle of a bucket, just when the diaphragm muscle drops down.<br>
 6. Record the breathing rate per minute and chest expansion,<br>
 6.1 when sitting quietly,<br>

 1. Use a rubber bulb to pump air into a beaker containing limewater.<br>
 Note the slow change in the limewater.<br>
 The air contains about 0.4% carbon dioxide.<br>
 2. Fit a short glass tube into the bore of a stopper that can fit into the neck of a bottle of aerated water, soda water.<br>
 Attach rubber tubing to the glass tube.<br>
 Fit the stopper into the neck of an opened bottle of aerated water.<br>
 Put the other end of the rubber tubing into a beaker of limewater.<br>
 Warm the bottle of aerated water with the hands.<br>
 Note the change in the limewater.<br>
 The aerated water contains carbon dioxide that forms bubbles, effervesces, and escapes when the bottle is opened.<br>
3. Blow exhaled air into the limewater.<br>
 Note the change in the limewater.<br>
 A cloudy precipitate soon forms, because exhaled breath contains about 4% carbon dioxide.<br>

 If the diaphragm is irritated by eating too quickly, drinking too much alcoholic drinks or carbonated drinks, or swallowing too much air, it may go into spasms.<br>
These spasms are sudden involuntary contraction of muscles that bounce air off the vocal cords.<br>
 We call the movement and the sound "hiccups".<br>
 In a healthy person, hiccups will gradually lessen and stop.<br>
 Immediate remedies include:<br>
 1. Blow into a paper bag and then hold the breath to increase the concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood.<br>
 2. Eat a teaspoonful of sugar.<br>
 3. Hold the breath while pinching the nose.<br>
 4. Drink 10 sips of water.<br>
 5. Inhale for count of five and exhale for count of eight.<br>
 However, if hiccups are severe, doctors may administer antispasmotic drugs, which relieves or prevents spasms of smooth muscle, i.e. involuntary muscle spasms.<br>

Experiments<br>
 1. Immerse a large jar so that the water level coincides with the 5 litre mark.<br>
 The large jar then contains 5 litres of air, inhalation air.<br>
 Insert a burning candle into the large jar.<br>
 Be careful! Melting wax from a burning candle can cause severe skin burns.<br>
 Use safety glasses and insulated, heat-proof gloves.<br>
 Close the neck of the large jar immediately.<br>
 Record the burning time of the candle.<br>
 For example, the candle was extinguished after 90 seconds.<br>
2. Insert the mouthpiece in the mouth and fill the large jar to the 5 litre mark with exhalation air.<br>
 With normal breathing this air has only been in the lungs for a few seconds.<br>
 Adjust the large jar so that the water level in it is 3 mm lower than in the tank.<br>
 Remove the stopper and put the candle holder with the lighted candle in the large jar.<br>
 Close the neck of the large jar immediately.<br>
 Record the burning time of the candle.<br>
 The candle burns for a much shorter period than in experiment 1.<br>
 3. Repeat experiment 2 with air retained in the lungs for a longer period than normal, e.g. 30 seconds, before breathing it out.<br>
 The candle in the large jar is extinguished immediately.<br>
 The longer air remains in the lungs, the more oxygen is absorbed into the bloodstream.<br>

 Heartburn (pyrosis) has nothing to do with the heart!<br>
 It is a burning feeling behind the breastbone and sometimes acid or bitter taste in the mouth caused by regurgitation of stomach contents after a heavy meal.<br>
Experiments<br>
 1. The respiratory rate is the number of breaths per minute.<br>
 Measure it by observing the chest rising and falling with every breath.<br>
 Rest for ten minutes and measure the respiratory rate again.<br>
 Normal values for resting persons, per minute: 3 months 30-50, 10 years 18-30, adult 8-18.<br>
2. After ten minutes rest, measure the heart rate by feeling the pulse.<br>

 Start counting the pulse.<br>
 Note the number of beats per minute.<br>
 It is from 60 to 100, usually about 70.<br>
 Do ten knee bends and measure the activity pulse.<br>
 The pulse rate tells us how fast the blood is pumped around the body.<br>
 After ten minutes rest, measure the recovery pulse.<br>
 Note whether the pulse has returned to the original resting pulse.<br>
 If a student is sick or just had a big meal, the pulse increases.<br>
 During sleep the respiratory rate is slower.<br>
 The best resting pulse is taken when awakening in the morning.<br>
 Normal values for resting persons, per minute: 3 months 70-170, 10 years 70-110, adult 50-95.<br>
 3. Roll up some paper to make a tight tube.<br>

<a href="../images/6.16.gif">See diagram 6.16</a>: Volume of air breathed out.<br>
 1. Measure how much air breathed out by displacement of water.<br>
 Use marked jars, each group should have at least three jars, buckets, basins or any pool of water, lengths of rubber hose or hollow pawpaw (papaya) sticks.<br>
 Each child will probably need three jars to measure how much air in the lung.<br>
 The children take turns using the jars.<br>
 Do the activity outside, because water will be spilt.<br>
 Take a deep breath.<br>
 Blow air out slowly into one jar until all the water has been pushed out.<br>
 Transfer to the next jar and blow more air out until your lungs are empty.<br>
 You may need a third jar.<br>
 The volume of the air in this person's lung is 1 000 cm<sup>3</sup> + 1000<sup>3</sup> cm + 200<sup>3</sup> cm = 2 200<sup>3</sup>cm.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.3.1H">9.3.1</a> Ear and hearing<br>
<a href="../images/9.235.gif">See diagram 9.235</a>: Vertical section of human ear<br>
 1. A sound wave is a longitudinal wave, so it consists of alternating compression and rarefaction, i.e. particles move closer together and farther apart.<br>
 A sound wave can pass through the ear canal of the outer ear to reach the sensitive eardrum, tympanic membrane, and causing it to vibrate at the same frequency.<br>
 The eardrum is attached to the bones of the middle ear, the ossicles.<br>
 The hammer (malleus) connects the eardrum to the anvil (incus) that connects to the stirrup (stapes) that connects to the oval window of the middle ear.<br>
 These bones transmit vibration from the eardrum to fluid in the cochlea, the portion of the inner ear responsible for hearing.<br>
 It looks like a snail's shell.<br>
 These vibrations in the inner ear cause nerve impulses to be transmitted to the brain by the auditory nerve.<br>
 The bones of the skull can also transmit vibrations.<br>
 You hear a sound if the waves reach the cochlea by either route.<br>
 When a sound reaches your two ears, you can distinguish the direction from which it comes.<br>
 If it comes from straight ahead, the vibrations reach both ears simultaneously and with the same strength.<br>
 If source of sound is on one side, one ear is farther away from it and receives the sound waves less strongly and with a slight delay.<br>
 The eardrum must be protected.<br>
 A perforated eardrum can lead to serious infection.<br>
 Never use a bobby pin or cotton buds to clean the ear.<br>
 When the ear canal gets blocked with wax, treat it with medical ear drops.<br>
 Do not hit anyone on the ear!<br>
 The eardrum can become perforated if the outer ear is hit with the open palm of the hand.<br>
 The Eustachian tube extends from the middle ear to the nasopharynx.<br>
 Usually it is closed.<br>
 It can open to let air pass and equalize the pressure between the middle ear and the atmosphere, causing a small "pop" sound.<br>
 This happens during change of height in an aircraft or during mountain travel.<br>
 People, and especially babies, with eustachian tubes blocked with mucus experience pain when an aircraft changes height.<br>
 2. Besides the cochlea, the inner ear also contains three small semicircular canals to maintain balance.<br>
 Movement of fluid in the semicircular canals sends messages to the brain about the speed of rotation of the head and the direction of movement of the head, e.g. nodding or looking behind.<br>
 Spinning the whole body causes giddiness, vertigo.<br>
Experiments<br>
3. Extreme vertigo: Mark a cross on the floor, bend the body at right angles, rotate the body with one eye looking down at the cross.<br>
 <b>Be careful!</b> This rotating movement may cause nausea!<br>
4. To balance the pressure in the middle ear with the outside pressure, hold the nose shut and blow softly or blow the nose or chew chewing gum.<br>
 During flight, the air pressure in a passenger aircraft is usually regulated to the pressure at 2000 metres above ground.<br>
5. In the ear, the three circular canals filled with fluid are set at angles to each other, so any movement of the head sets off nervous impulses to allow the brain to interpret the signals and maintain balance.<br>
This action is similar to the way a gyroscope can keeps a forward motion in a constant direction.<br>
6. Earwax that lubricates the ear canal is a mixture of cerumen, skin cells, bits of hairs and substances caught in the wax.<br>
 Cerumen is a secretion produced by the sebaceous glands in the outer ear canal.<br>
 Cerumen may be "dry" or "wet", with Asians having dry cerumen and Europeans having wet cerumen.<br>
 The colour of cerumen may vary from grey (dry) to light brown (wet).<br>
 With age, wet cerumen darkens and becomes less liquid.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.102H">9.102</a> Voice and speaking<br>
<a href="../images/9.237.jpg">See diagram 9.237</a>: Vocal cords. 1. vocal cords, 2. epiglottis, 3. larynx.<br>
 Mouth, teeth, tongue, throat and lungs are all used in the production of the voice.<br>
 Sound is produced by vibrations of two thin sheets of membrane called the vocal folds (formerly vocal cords), stretched across the sound chamber, the larynx.<br>
 The larynx is the upper end of the windpipe, at the base of the tongue.<br>
 The front of the larynx, the "Adam's apple" is usually prominent in males.<br>
 A trap door of cartilage, the epiglottis, automatically drops down over the larynx when swallowing, so no food can pass down the windpipe.<br>
 When the vocal folds, are stretched by the contraction of muscles in the throat, a narrow slit forms between them.<br>
 When air is forced through this narrow slit that the vocal folds are forced to vibrate, causing air to vibrate in the windpipe, lungs, mouth and nasal cavities.<br>
 The vocal folds in the throat act as a double reed and are set in motion by air exhaled from the lungs.<br>
 The quality and tone of the sound depends on the size and shape of the resonating cavities, e.g. the windpipe, the back of the throat, the mouth and other air filled parts of the head.<br>
 For the human voice, the vocal folds in the throat act as a double reed and are set in motion by air exhaled from the lungs.<br>
 The quality and tone of the human sound depends on the size and shape of the resonating cavities such as the windpipe, the back of the throat, the mouth and other air filled parts of the head.<br>
 Ventriloquists speak in the normal manner, but with some modification of their speech.<br>
 They allow their breath to escape slowly, narrow the glottis at the back of the throat, open their mouth as little as possible and retract the tongue while moving only its tip.<br>
 The resultant pressure on the vocal folds diffuses the sound so that it appears to come from another source.<br>
 The greater the pressure on the vocal folds, the greater the deception.<br>
 Ventriloquists use a dummy with moving lips to aid in their deception that the sound they are making is not coming from themselves.<br>
 Other animals, including lions, can "throw their voices".<br>
Experiments<br>
 1. Feel vibration of the vocal folds (not vocal "cords"), which allow puffs of air to pass and produce sound waves.<br>
 Sing or speak loudly while pressing your fingers on your neck near the your larynx or the male "Adam's apple", (laryngeal prominence).<br>
 Press your thumb and forefinger against your larynx and make a low pitched sound with your voice.<br>
 Feel your own sound vibration.<br>
 Place your finger on your throat then speak.<br>
 Feel and experience that the throat oscillates when it speaks.<br>
 Try to stop pronouncing suddenly during speaking.<br>
 The oscillation of the throat will stop suddenly.<br>
2. Make a nasal sound ("ng"), and a non-nasal sound ("ah"), with your mouth open / closed, with your nose sealed with the fingers / not sealed.<br>
 The soft palate, velum, is usually in a high position when all of the air and sound goes through the mouth.<br>
 However, it can be lowered to connect the nasal pathway to the mouth and lower vocal tract and lowered further to seal the mouth off from the nasal pathway from nose to larynx.<br>
 Repeat the experiment while whispering to produce a windy sound.<br>
 You cannot feel any vibrations, because the vocal folds have closed and do not vibrate.<br>
 Try to sing in a whisper.<br>
3. Sing and whistle octaves into a two metres long pipe and use the resonance to show your whistling range is much higher than your singing range.<br>
4. Sit in a comfortable space, breathe deeply, sing a low note and listen to it.<br>
 While holding the low note, slowly change the shape of your mouth.<br>
 Hear different vowel sounds.<br>
 Keep listening and hear other notes, overtones.<br>
 You are now an oscillator.<br>
 Your vocal cords producing the main note and the mouth shape filter emphasizes particular overtones.<br>

 1. Attach a 50 cm<sup>3</sup> syringe to a 1 cm<sup>3</sup> pipette, as
in the diagram.<br>
 The sodium hydroxide solution absorbs carbon dioxide released during respiration.<br>
 Change in air pressure inside the syringe is caused by the consumption
 of oxygen by the organism and is shown by change of the 
 water level in the pipette.<br>
 The rise in the water level per unit time indicates the rate of respiration
 of the organism.<br>
 A steady drop of the liquid level in the pipette indicates a leak in the

 When testing green plants, cover the syringe with aluminium foil to exclude
 light.<br>
 When the meniscus reaches the upper part of the pipette, move it down again

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.6.2H">9.6.2</a> Sense of touch, somatic sensory system<br>
 Meissner corpuscles are just below the epidermis of the skin and are sensitive to any light touch.<br>
 They occur mainly in the face, fingertips, genitals, lips, palms of hands, soles of feet, and tongue.<br>
 Merkel nerve endings are in superficial skin layers and fingertip ridges and are sensitive to pressure.<br>
 Pacinian corpuscles are deep in the skin, in mesenteries (membranes connecting the small intestine to the posterior wall of the abdomen), 
 and around joints and detect vibration and big pressure changes.<br>
 These mechanoreceptors are not uniformly distributed in the skin, so some parts of the body are more sensitive to touch than others.<br>
 When the skin is touched in two separate points within a single receptive field, the student cannot feel the two separate points.<br>
 If the two points touched span more than a single receptive field then both will be felt.<br>
 The closer the receptive fields, the greater the resolution of touch.<br>
 So mechanoreceptors are more dense in the fingertips and less dense in the palms of the hands.<br>
 The sense of touch is used by blind people reading the Braille alphabet, people feeling coins and banknotes that have raised letters to help their identification and wool-classers that rate the fineness of wool
by feel.<br>
Experiments<br>
<a href="../images/9.243.gif">See diagram 9.243</a>: Touch with dividers<br>
 1. Investigate the sensitivity to touch of different parts of the body.<br>
 Tie a blindfold over the eyes and touch objects with the fingers, e.g. table top, coins, cup, pins, clothing.<br>
 Describe the feelings.<br>
 Repeat the experiment by touching the same objects with the back of the hand.<br>
 Describe the feelings and whether they are the same as before.<br>
 2. Tie a blindfold over the eyes and ask another student to touch gently different parts of the back of the hand with a touching bristle.<br>
 Note when and where you feel the touching bristle.<br>
 Repeat the experiment on the end of a finger and on the bare forearm.<br>
 Do not test on other parts of the body.<br>
 3. Use a paper clip opened to be V-shaped or a hairpin or two thick hairs.<br>
 Start with the points 40 mm apart.<br>
 Tie a blindfold over the eyes and ask another student to touch gently different parts of the back of the hand with only one point or with both points.<br>
 Point to where the body was touched and say whether it was one point or two points.<br>
 Repeat the experiment by reducing the distance between the points.<br>
 Note the distance between the points when a touch with both points feels like a touch with only one point.<br>
 When the points touch close together, they feel like one point.<br>
 Repeat the experiment on the end of a finger and on the bare forearm.<br>
 Different parts of the body have different sensitivity, but do not test on other parts of the body.<br>
 This experiment was originally done with the points of geometrical dividers or even two pins, but these objects may be too dangerous for school children to use in this experiment.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.5.1H">9.5.1</a> Sense of smell, the olfactory system<br>
 The olfactory neuroepithelium is at the upper area of each nasal chamber.<br>
 As humans age, the number of olfactory neurones steadily decreases.<br>
 The sense of smell is caused by stimulation of the olfactory receptor cells by volatile chemicals carried as airborne molecules.<br>
 An odour's stimulating effectiveness depends on the duration, volume, and velocity of a sniff.<br>
 Each olfactory receptor cell is a sensory neurone.<br>
 The average nasal cavity contains more than 100 million sensory neurones generated throughout life by the underlying base cells.<br>
 So new receptor cells are generated every 30-60 days.<br>
 Humans have many hundreds of different olfactory receptors, but each neurone expresses only one receptor type, part of an olfactory "map".<br>
 An odour activates a set of odour receptors depending on its chemical composition.<br>
 The vomeronasal organ (VNO) (Jacobson organ) is a membranous structure within pits of the anterior nasal septum.<br>
 Its opening 2 cm from the nostril is visible in nearly all adult humans.<br>
 It detects the external chemical signals called pheromones, but these signals are not detected as perceptible smells by the olfactory system.<br>
 Pheromones send messages to all individuals in the species to mediate behaviour, e.g. alarm, food trail for ants, sex responses and possibly synchronization of menstrual cycles among women living together.<br>
Experiments<br>

 Repeat the experiments with different foodstuffs.<br>
2. Repeat the experiment with one nostril closed.<br>

3. Test the ability to detect the smell of baby powder, chocolate, cinnamon, coffee, mothballs, peanut butter, soap, banana, petrol (gasoline) lemon, onion, paint thinner, pineapple, rose, and turpentine.<br>
4. Collect different substances that have different kinds of smell.<br>
 Be careful! Do not let students smell volatile liquids, e.g. petrol, methylated spirit, alcohol, pesticides, correcting fluid and dry cleaning fluid.<br>
 A description of smells may include the following: "fruity" from ripe fruit, "fragrant" from flowers and perfume, "onion" from onion or garlic, sulfur from sulfur or volcanic gases, "burning" from burning meat or coffee or tobacco, "burning feathers' from feathers or silk or wool or rubber or hair, "sweaty", from sweat, old cheese, and goats, "foul" from rotten meat, rotten vegetables and faeces.<br>
Repeat the experiment with the students blindfolded.<br>
5. Check some folklore about smell and taste<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.5.2H">9.5.2</a> Sense of taste, the gustatory system<br>
 Flavour is a mixture of taste, smell and feel of the food in the mouth.<br>
 Taste perception occurs in individual taste buds with multiple receptor cells in each bud.<br>
 Taste buds are modified epithelial cells, with a life span of about 10 days and arise continuously from the underlying base cell layer.<br>
 If you burn your tongue, new taste buds can later replace any damaged taste buds.<br>
 Taste buds occupy projections embedded in the tongue epithelium called lingual papillae.<br>
 A single nerve fibre innervates multiple taste papillae.<br>
 A single nerve fibre can respond to different types of tastes, called 
"broad tuning".<br>
 Lingual papillae have 4 forms, each in different areas of the tongue.<br>
 Taste buds also occur in the soft palate, epiglottis and larynx, and the pharynx.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.5.3H">9.5.3</a> The five different taste qualities<br>
 1. salty, 2. sweet, 3. sour, 4. bitter, and 5. umami (savoury taste of monosodium glutamate).<br>
 Another proposed taste quality is chalky (calcium salts).<br>
 There are no "taste areas" on the tongue.<br>
 The five taste qualities can be detected in all regions of the tongue, but certain areas of the tongue have lower thresholds for each quality.<br>
 Sweetness is most readily detected at the tip of the tongue.<br>
 Salty taste receptors focus on the front and side borders of the tongue.<br>
 Sour tastes are best perceived along the lateral border, and bitter sensations are tasted most in the posterior one third.<br>
 Salt taste is caused by sodium ions and sour taste is cause by hydrogen ions in solution.<br>
 Sweet taste, bitter taste and umami taste is caused by reactions with proteins on the surface of the taste buds.<br>
 You can experience all the qualities of taste in all regions of the tongue where taste buds occur.<br>
 Some people experience differences in sensitivity and people may vary in the number of taste buds in different regions of the tongue.<br>
 Some people in Africa who an eat very hot chillies are supposed to have a low density of taste buds on the tongue.<br>
 However, there are NO "taste areas" on the tongue.<br>
 Salt taste is caused by sodium ions and sour taste is cause by hydrogen ions in solution.<br>
 Sweet taste, bitter taste and umami taste is caused by reactions with proteins on the surface of the taste buds.<br>

 Tie a blindfold over the eyes, taste the different foods and record the tastes in order of tasting.<br>
 Repeat the experiment while holding your nose and breathing only through the mouth.<br>
 Taste the different foods and record the tastes in the same order of tasting.<br>
 If the nose is held tight, no air can move through the nasal space and you cannot smell anything.<br>
 You may notice that foods tastes the same when you have a cold.<br>

 Dry the surface of the tongue with a clean handkerchief, stretch it out as far as possible and look at the tongue with a mirror to note the many taste buds.<br>
 Describe the taste sensation after you place on different parts of the tongue a drop of the following:<br>
 * Dilute solution of sucrose, saccharin or aspartame for sweet taste.<br>
 * Dilute vinegar solution for sour taste.<br>
 * Dilute table salt solution for salt taste.<br>
 * Dilute quinine solution (tonic water) or raw almond for bitter taste.<br>
 * Dilute solution of the amino acid monosodium glutamate, MSG, for "umami" taste.<br>
 * Experience all the qualities of taste in all regions of the tongue where taste buds occur.<br>
 Some people experience differences in sensitivity and people may vary in the number of taste buds in different regions of the tongue.<br>
 4. Put a drop of boiled starch solution on your tongue and let it mix with the saliva.<br>
 Leave it there until you can notice a slight change in taste.<br>
 The saliva contains an enzyme ptyalin that changes starch to maltose sugar.<br>
 It causes the sweet taste.<br>
 Repeat the experiment with a piece of raw meat and a piece of pure fat.<br>
 You do not notice any change of taste, because ptyalin does not act on protein or fat.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.3.2H">9.3.2</a> Human ear, how the ear works, model of the ear<br>
<a href="../images/9.235.gif">See diagram 9.235</a>: Human ear, VS<br>
 The ear drum is a very thin membrane is moved by sound energy of the sound.<br>
 If the ear drum does not vibrate, you do not hear sound.<br>
 If the longitudinal wave has the right frequency and enough energy, your ear drum antennas will pick it up and your brain will turn the energy into what we call sound.<br>
 Air vibrations enter the ear by the auditory passage formed at the base of the ear by the eardrum membrane.<br>
 They set the eardrum in motion and, in doing so, set in motion the system of three little bones attached to it.<br>
 By this means they reach a cavity in the bone called the inner ear.<br>
 One part of the ear is shaped like a snail shell.<br>
 Here is found the organ that receives the sound vibrations and is connected with the brain by the auditory nerve.<br>
 Another part of the inner ear includes three small semicircular canals and serves to maintain equilibrium.<br>
 It plays no part in hearing.<br>
 Sound vibrations are normally transmitted to the snail shell shaped cochlea by the eardrum and the small bones.<br>
 This causes a nerve message carried to the brain.<br>
 They can also be transmitted by the bones of the skull, and you hear a sound if the waves reach the cochlea by either route.<br>
 When a sound reaches your two ears, you can distinguish the direction from which it comes.<br>
 If it comes from straight ahead, the vibrations reach both ears simultaneously and with the same strength.<br>
 However, if the source of the sound is on one side of us, one of your ears is further away from it and receives the waves less strongly and with a slight delay.<br>
 The pinnae collect the sound and contributes to your sense of direction.<br>
 Sound is transmitted from the auditory canal via the eardrum into the middle ear.<br>
 In the middle ear small bones act as an impedance matching mechanism.<br>
 This maximizes the amount of signal that is passed on to the brain.<br>
 The bones also magnify the vibrations of the eardrum.<br>
 The message is then passed into the cochlea and on to the nerve that takes the message to the brain.<br>
 The auditory canal is a tube of air that can vibrate and is closed at one end by the eardrum.<br>
Experiments<br>
 1. Binaural hearing<br>
 Hold the ends of a long tube to each ear and have someone tap in the centre and then a few centimetres to each side.<br>
 2. Direction of sound, direction judgment of the ear<br>
 To identify the direction and position of sound cover your eyes with a piece of black cloth.<br>
 Other students emit sounds at different positions at a classroom, e.g. shake a string of keys, rub a piece of paper.<br>
 Describe each sound source and its direction and position.<br>
 Repeat the experiment with various sound sources emitting the sounds at the same time.<br>
 Human hearing can not only identify the directions and positions of a sound sources, but also tell their characters.<br>
 High frequency location depends on difference in intensity produced by the shadow of the head.<br>
 Location of low pitched sounds depends on phase difference.<br>
 Use a model stethoscope with one tube longer than the other.<br>
3. Range of hearing<br>
 The range of human hearing is from about 20 vibrations per second to about 20, 000 vibrations per second, nearly 10 octaves.<br>
 Use an oscillator driving an audio system to show the range of hearing.<br>
 Use a set of good speakers.<br>
 Use whistles, tuning forks to establish upper range of hearing.<br>
 The Galton whistle can be adjusted to produce an intense sound into the ultrasonic range.<br>

The blind spot, scotoma, is an area about the side of a pin head where the optic nerve passes through the retina.<br>
In this small are of the retina, there are no photoreceptors so it is called a blind spot.<br>
In the left eye, the blind spot is about 15 <sup0</sup> to the left of looking straight ahead, i.e. about two hand widths at the ends of extended arms.<br>
In the right eye, the blind spot is about 15 <sup0</sup> to the right of looking straight ahead, i.e, about two hand widths at the ends of extended arms.<br>
Experiment<br>
1. Find the blind spot.<br>
On a piece of paper, make a small dot with a black marker.<br>
About 15 cm to the right of the dot, make a small plus sign (+)<br>
With your right eye closed, hold the paper about 50 cm away from you.<br>
Focus on the plus sign with your left eye, and slowly bring the paper closer while still looking at the plus sign.<br>
Notice when the dot vanishes from your sight.<br>
This is the blind spot of your retina.<br> 
If you close your left eye and look at the dot with your right eye, and repeat the process, the plus sign should disappear in the blind spot of your other eye.<br>
2. Some people think they do not see cars approaching from behind in the parallel lane because the image of the car falls in the blind spot.<br>
If this is true, the side-view mirrors give a different angle to view the approaching car, so you an see it because there is no blind spot.<br> 

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.4.3H">9.4.3</a> Chromatic aberration of the eye<br>
Chromatic aberration occurs when different wave lengths of light have different focal lengths.<br>
So different wavelengths of light are refracted at a different angle.<br>
The duochrome chart has black letters on a red background and a green background.<br>
The red and green wavelengths in the chart are equally distant from the yellow wavelength (570 nm).<br> 
The longer wavelength (red) is refracted less than the shorter (green).<br> 
The eye focuses at about the midpoint of the spectrum, at yellow wavelength, between the red and green wavelengths.<br> 
During a test, the patient must not prefer red because red is a favourite colour!<br>
An optician can use spherical correction glasses so that the red and green letters appear equally sharp to the patient.<br>

 A person with vision rated as "20/10" has very good vision.<br>

Notice the difference then keep lookinh at the chart as you move away from it across the room.
At about 5 m from the chart the two patterns both look grey.<br>
From this distance L, you can calculate the angular resolution of your eyes:
angular resolution = (2 mm)/L (in radians).
Using the above equation, L = 4 m corresponds to an angular resolution of 0.03 degrees.
The diffraction limit of the eye can be calculated using Rayleigh's criterion:
angular resolution = (1.22)(lambda)/D,
where lambda is the wavelength of light (on the average, about 550 nm) and D is the diameter of the eye's pupil, which is about 5 mm indoors. 
This calculation results in an angular resolution of 0.008 degrees. 
If your eyes could resolve images at the diffraction limit, you could resolve the lines in the printed pattern.<br>
 The latter is the value used in the international definition of visual acuity = 1/gap size [arc min]

Starring at a pure colour for a long time causes cone cell fatigue, - those cone cells need a rest.<br> 
If you look at a white area after staring at a red image, you will see a different coloured after image.<br> 
Experiment<br>
Cover one eye. 
Look at the round red colour to the left in the diagram for 30 seconds.<br>
Cover the red colour with white paper and stare at the white area to the right.<br>
Can you see the blue-green afterimage?
Test the other eye.
Can you see the blue-green afterimage?
Were the after images the same? 

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.6.5H">9.6.5</a> Women feel colder then men.<br>
Women feel the cold more than men, but their bodies are better at conserving heat when the weather turns colder.<br>
Women are usually smaller so they have a higher surface area to volume ratio than men and thus shed heat faster.<br>
Heat generation is proportional to volume (radius<sup>3</sup>), but heat dissipation is proportional to skin surface area (radius<sup>2</sup>).<br>
The smaller your size, the lower your heat generation to heat dissipation ratio, and the colder you are.<br>
So a woman with a higher surface area to volume ratio than a man, will lose heat more quickly and feel colder.<br>
Women usually have a slightly lower metabolic rate, because of their typically smaller size, so they generate less heat.<br>
Men have more heat-generating muscle mass.<br>
The more muscle, the more blood flow and warmth.<br>
Women have a higher percentage of body fat, but that does not insulate them.<br>
Women usually have less insulating fat on the upper body and around the waist, but more padding on hips and thighs.<br>
Men may have extra fat around the waist and upper torso, where it may help insulate vital organs and prevent the core temperature from decreasing.<br>
Women have less vigorous blood circulation to arms and legs, so their hands and feet are often the first to feel the cold.<br>
<a name="CelluliteH">Cellulite</a><br>
Deposits of fat that push against the connective tissue mainly in the thighs and nearby regions to form a dimpled surface, commonly called cellulite.<br>
It occurs mainly in older women and is difficult to remove without persistent dieting.<br>
Cellulite is indicated by pinched skin of the upper thigh that appears lumpy.<br>
Women can shut off the blood flow to the skin and extremities to maintain their core temperature at 37<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
Most of the temperature sensors are in the skin so we feel cold if the extremities are cold no matter the temperature of the internal organs.<br>
The average woman has 20 to 25% body fat, but the average man has about 15% body fat.<br>
A woman has a more even distribution of body fat, so a man will tend not experience such a change in temperature.<br>
So women feel cold before men do.<br>
The hands and feet of women are colder.<br>
For example one report states that the hand temperature of women are about 2.9<sup>o</sup>C lower, but their core body temperature is about 0.4<sup>o</sup>C higher.<br>
Women have less muscle mass than men so they need a more efficient technique to protect their core body temperature.<br>
Also, the core body temperature of women changes during the menstrual cycle.<br>
People who feel cold all the time could be suffering from hypothyroidism, or diabetes, or anaemia.<br>
