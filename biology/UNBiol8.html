Staphylococcus aureus is a common parasite of human and animals, produces several enterotoxins, food poisoning,
(vomiting and diarrhoea), pyrogenic and respiratory infections.<br>
Streptococcus mutans causes tooth decay. It needs both glucose and fructose from the breakdown of sucrose in food
and soft drinks to produce plaque and lactic acid.<br>
Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium, (enterococci), are intestinal bacteria, but live also on
plants.<br>
They are indicators of insufficient hygiene, and, together with Escherichia coli, indicate the presence of faecal
material.<br>
Streptococcus pyogenes are systemic in respiratory tract, and cause infectious diseases, e.g. scarlet fever.<br>
Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus is used for yoghurt production, together with Lactobacillus
bulgaricus.<br>

<h3>8.6 Rod-shaped bacillus Bacillus species</h3>
"Bacillus"" or plural "bacilli", refers to any rod-shaped bacterium.<br>
Latin <i>bacillus</i> stick.
For some people, "bacillus" means any pathogenic bacterium.<br>
Any rod-shaped species may be describes as being "bacillary"<br>
"Coccobacillus" and "coccobacilli" are short rods, e.g. Bordetella, Brucella, Francisella, Haemophilus<br>
Also, "Bacillus" refers to a genus of bacteria:<br>
Phylum: Bacillota. (former phylum Firmicutes), Class: Bacilli, Order: Bacillales, Family: Bacillaceae, Genus:
Bacillus<br>
Bacillus is a genus of Gram-positive, rod-shaped bacterium, with over 250 named species.<br>
some Bacillus species may be dependent on oxygen, but others can survive in the absence of oxygen.<br>
If not enough nutrients, a Bacillus cell can become a dormant endospore, which can survive for a long time.
Family Bacillaceae contains Bacillus and Clostridium species.<br>
Bacillus species are resistant to antibiotics and may cause food spoilage.
Bacillus species are used to produce the enzyme alpha amylase for starch hydrolysis.<br>
Bacillus anthracis, causes disease anthrax, in hoofed animals, rarely in humans as cutaneous anthrax black scab
(eschar), but may become fatal.<br>
Bacillus cereus, soil bacteria, may cause food poisoning (enterotoxins)<br>
Bacillus subtilis, is used for biotechnology and for teaching<br>
Bacillus thuringiensis, produces the protein Cry5B, used as a crop pesticide and could be used to clear nematode
parasites from people.<br>

<h3>8.11 Bacteria in humans, bacterial diseases.</h3>
<a href="../images/9.205.1.gif">See diagram 9.205.1</a>: Different bacteria.<br>
In the healthy person, both the human genome and the microbiome, (of bacteria contribute to metabolic pathways.<br>
Bacteria contribute to the health of a person in the following ways:.<br>
* Toxin degeneration.<br>
* Micronutrient synthesis.<br>
* Glycan and amino acid metabolism.<br>
Microorganisms are used to make foods, e.g. yoghurt and cheese, but other microorganisms "spoil" food, given the
appropriate conditions of temperature, pH and moisture.<br>
Microbial contamination accounted for 34% of all food recalls by Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ),
between 1 January 1990 and 31 December 2004.<br>
Of these recalls, 41% were due to Listeria monocytogenes contamination, 19% were due to Salmonella contamination and
13% were from (Escherichia coli) contamination.<br>
People most affected by food poisoning are the elderly, the young and immune suppressed individuals.<br>

<h3>8.10 Different bacteria experiment, (Primary)</h3>
Bacteria, (Singular: Bacterium), live like fungi, but they are so small you cannot see them except with a
microscope, but you can see what they do.<br>
Experiment<br>
Dissolve soup powder or cube in a cup of hot water and pour evenly into 3 clean glasses.<br>
Add 1 teaspoon of salt to one glass.<br>
Add 1 teaspoon of vinegar (acetic acid), to the second glass.<br>
Add nothing to the third glass.<br>
Cover the glasses and leave them in a warm place for 2 -3 days.<br>
The first two glasses remain clear, because they contain substances that stop bacteria growing.<br>
The liquid in the third glass is cloudy, because it contains so many bacteria.<br>

<h3>8.3.0 Yoghurt and lactic acid bacteria "Yakult"</h3>
Lactic acid bacteria convert lactose to lactic acid by a form of fermentation.
They are used to preserve milk and perhaps have the probiotic function of increasing pH in the intestine to lower
the activity of harmful bacteria.<br>
Lactic acid bacteria are mainly <a href="#LactobacillusH">Lactobacillus</a> Leuconostoc, Pediococcus, Lactococcus
lactis, and Streptococcus.<br>
Yoghurt is prepared from two species of bacteria:<br>
1. Chains of cocci or diplococci of Streptococcus thermophilus.<br>
2. Rod-shape bacilli of Lactobacillus acidophilus or Lactobacillus bulgaricuse.<br>
The bacteria have been renamed:<br>
Lactobacillus delbrueckii (subsp. bulgaricus), for (Lactobacillus bulgaricus).<br>
Streptococcus salivarius (subsp. thermophilus), for Streptococcus thermophilus.<br>
Lactobacillus casei is a species of non-starter lactic acid bacteria, (NSLAB), found in ripening Cheddar cheese.<br>
Yakult was developed by Dr Minoru Shirota (1899-1982), as Lactobacillus casei strain shirota for production of
"Yakult", the
yogurt-like probiotic drink.<br>
<br>
<a name="ProbioticH"></a>
<b>Probiotic organisms</b>, usually lactic acid bacteria, (LAB), and bifidobacteria
(formerly Lactobacillus bifidus), are live microorganisms,
thought to be beneficial to the host organism, usually consumed as part of fermented foods with specially-added
active live cultures, e.g. yoghurt.<br>
Lactobacillus acidophilus occurs naturally in the human gastrointestinal tract, mouth and vagina, and may be used
with Streptococcus salivarius (subsp. thermophilus), and with Lactobacillus delbrueckii (subsp. bulgaricus), to
produce acidophilus-type yoghurt.<br>
Leuconostoc citrovorum with Streptococcus lactis convert lactic acid to aldehydes and ketones to produce buttermilk
with its characteristic flavour and aroma.<br>

<h3>8.4.0 Sulfonamides, sulfa drugs.</h3>
<a href="../images/14.04chd.gif">See diagram 14.12</a>: Sulfanilamides, sulflilamide, sulfamethoxazole.<br>
Sulfanilamide, p-aminobenzenesulfonamide, Toxic if ingested, liver toxin.<br>
The first of the antibacterial drugs, the sulfonamides, were found effective against the cocci infections caused by
the bacteria streptococci, gonococci and pneumococci.<br>
The basic compound is called sulfanilamide, (sulphanilamide, sulfamine, 4-aminobenzenesulfonamide), C6H8N2O2S.<br>
Many derivatives can be made from this compound by modifying the molecule to change its potency or reduce side
effects or toxicity.<br>
The effectiveness of these drugs depends on maintaining the basic structure and shape of the molecule.<br>
One of the essential growth compounds for most bacteria susceptible to the sulfonamides is p-aminobenzoic acid,
(4-aminobenzoic acid), C7H7NO2.<br>
Bacteria absorb a sulfonamide, because its shape and charge distribution is similar to p-aminobenzoic acid, and then
they cannot metabolize it.<br>
Bacteria use p-aminobenzoic acid to produce folic acid, but, unlike humans, cannot absorb folic acid from their
food.<br>
Prontosil sulfanilamide requires the patient to drink copious quantities of water at the same time, because kidney
damage was caused by earlier products.<br>
The term "sulfanilamides" refers to the family of molecules based on sulfanilamide, so it is a chemical term.<br>
The term sulfonamide (sulfa drugs), refers to drugs based on sulfanilamide, so it is a medical term.<br>
Sulfonamides (sulfa drugs), do not kill bacteria, but prevent them growing and multiplying to allow natural immunity
processes to deal with them.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2">
<a name="8.4.1H"></a>
<h3>8.4.1 Sensitivity to drugs determined by genes.</h3>
Individual people fall into two genetic groups, those who acetylate drugs like sulfonamides fast and those who do so
slowly.<br>
While 90% of Japanese and Chinese are fast acetylators, only 40% of Americans, (both black and white), acetylate
drugs fast.<br>
Acetylation is often the first step in metabolizing and thus deactivating a drug, so slow acetylators are exposed to
higher levels of a drug given at the same dose.<br>
The acetyl derivative of sulfa thiazole is not very soluble.<br>
It tended to block kidney tubules and lead to death, so it was replaced by sulfadiazine.<br>
The same acetylating enzyme deactivates some carcinogens, e.g. the aromatic amines benzidene and o-tolidine, used in
dyestuff manufacture and as analytical reagents in the detection of blood and chlorine levels in water.<br>
Slow acetylators are at higher risk of bladder cancer from these chemicals.<br>
Examples of sulfa drugs:<br>
Sulfamethoxazole / trimethoprim, "TMP-SMZ", C10H11N3O3S, (Bactrim, Septra, Co-trimoxazole, Cotrim, Sulfatrim).<br>
Sulfasalazine, C18H14N4O5S, (Azulfidine, Sulfazine).<br>
Sulfisoxazole, C11H13N3O3S, (Gantrisin, Truxazole).<br>

<h3>8.12 Bacterial infections, germ theory, Pasteur, Koch.</h3>
1. The symptoms of a bacterial infection are usually local redness, heat, swelling and local pain and sometimes the
formation of pus.<br>
By contrast viral infections usually affect many parts of the body, e.g. blocked nose, cough and headache.<br>
However, local virus infections include conjunctivitis (pink eye, truck driver's eye), and herpes.<br>
Herpes is painful, but most viral diseases feel more like an itch.<br>
Pus is a yellow white viscous fluid formed in infected tissue, containing white blood cells (polymorphonuclear
leucocytes) remains of cells, dead tissue, and micro-organisms.<br>
Pus should be surgically drained as soon as possible.<br>
Normal body temperature (orally) = 36.8 (+ or -) 0.5<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
Fever is occurring if body temperature = or &gt; 37.5<sup>o</sup>C (in the mouth), 37.2<sup>o</sup>C (under the
arm), 38.0<sup>o</sup>C (in the rectum).<br>
2. Infections of the skin by Staphylococcus aureus include the following:<br>
* Infection of the hair follicles as small white head pimples at the base of hair shafts or as a swollen red boil
(furuncle, carbuncle).<br>
* Impetigo blisters then crusts on the surface of the skin of young children.<br>
* Cellulitis infection below the skin surface.<br>
* Infection of the eyelid glands (hordeolum, stye).<br>
3. The germ theory developed by Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch identified the cause of diseases, starting with
anthrax and finishing with tuberculosis and plague.<br>
The principle of identification was set out in Koch's postulates in 1881:<br>
* The germ is always present in the disease.<br>
* The germ can be cultivated outside the body and preserved for generations.<br>
* The disease can be reproduced in experimental animals.<br>
* The organism causing the disease cannot be found in inoculated animals.<br>

<h3>8.5.5 Pasteur's spontaneous generation experiment.</h3>
It was believed that living organisms could develop from non-living matter without pre-existing living matter - that
disease can develop spontaneously in damaged human tissue without any exterior organism being involved.<br>
In 1859 Louis Pasteur, tested this belief by putting boiled clear meat soup into a swan neck flask.<br>
Then the swan neck was heated to kill any living things in it.<br>
The swan neck flask was left standing while dust fell from the air and accumulated in the loop of the swan neck.<br>
Air from the atmosphere could still pass by the dust in the swan neck.<br>
The meat soup remained clear.<br>
Later, Pasteur tipped the flask so that the dust in the loop of the swan neck fell into the flask.<br>
The meat soup in the flask became cloudy, because of bacterial infection from the dust in the air.<br>
Experiment<br>

Some teachers have put the first flask in a place where it is not moved for a long time and the meat soup in it
still remains clear.<br>

<h3>8.5 Anti-microbial disinfectants, (Experiment)</h3>
Anti-microbial disinfectants affect growth of <a href="#EscherichiaH">Escherichia coli</a>.<br>
Joseph Lister, 1827-1912, England, first introduced aseptic surgery in 1867.<br>
He used a spray of carbolic acid, (phenol C6H5OH), as a germicide to reduce mortality of post operative surgery.<br>
Common anti-bacterials are ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, synthetic detergents, (QAC, Quaternary Ammonium Compounds),
and phenols.<br>
Phenols sterilize well, but are corrosive and toxic.<br>
Detergents and 70% alcohol have some microbiocidal effect, but are not sporicidal and dry out skin surfaces.<br>
Experiment<br>
Prepare the plates and then put a "'wash" of <a href="#EscherichiaH">Escherichia coli</a> on the agar.<br>
Sterilize small paper discs, as from a hole punch, and then soak them into different anti-microbials preparations or
use multi-disks impregnated with antibiotics.<br>
Place the discs on the agar plates then incubate for two of days.<br>
If the anti bacterial is effective, there is a clear ring around the disc where the Escherichia coli have not
grown.<br>
Use the width of this ring, the zone of inhibition, to indicate effectiveness of the anti-microbials
preparations.<br>
Pay strict attention to the disposal of waste.<br>

Pseudomonas aeruginosa can reduce the amount of fixed nitrogen, (as fertilizer), by up to 50 percent.<br>
2NO3<sup>-</sup> + 10e<sup>-</sup> + 12H<sup>+</sup>→ N2 + 6H2O.<br>
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is <b>NOT</b> suitable for use in schools.<br>
It is said to be responsible for one-in-ten hospital-acquired infections, an opportunistic bacteria that attacks
weakened immune systems.<br>
It mutates rapidly and is acquiring resistance to antibiotics, e.g. ciprofloxacin, because of exposure to the
disinfectant BSK, benzalkonium chloride.<br>
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is <b>NOT</b> suitable for use in schools, soil bacteria, food poisoning, infections, e.g.
burns, urinary and respiratory tract, hospital-acquired infection.<br>

<h3>8.16 Denitrifying bacteria.</h3>
Nitrogen-fixing organisms that convert nitrogen in the soil air into nitrates include Rhizobium in small nodules on
the roots of legumes and blue-green algae in wet soils.<br>
However, some denitrifying bacteria in wet soils convert nitrates back into nitrogen gas and so make nitrogenous
substances unavailable to plants.<br>
Denitrifying bacteria reduce nitrates or nitrites to nitrogen-containing gases.<br>
Most denitrifiers produce nitrous oxide, N2O, instead of dinitrogen, N2, under aerobic conditions, e.g. Paracoccus
denitrificans.<br>
Bacillus denitrificans (Pseudomonas stutzeri), are denitrifying soil bacterium, under the anaerobic conditions of
swampy or waterlogged soils<br>
They decompose ammonia and nitrates to liberate nitrogen and reduce the available combined nitrogen in the soil.<br>
Denitrification occurs in a diverse group of Gram-negative, motile bacteria, e.g. Pseudomonas denitrificans.<br>
However, denitrification is an important stage in the nitrogen cycle that indirectly makes more nitrogen available
to plants by turning nitrates that may remain
unavailable deep in the soil or washed into the sea into nitrogen available from the air.<br>

Actinomycetes can decompose cellulose, chitin and other molecules to form humus.<br>
In high pH environments, it can form antibiotics, (e.g. actinomysin, streptomycin, tetracycline), insecticides,
fungicides.<br>
Actinomycetes are filamentous or rod-shape and do not form endospores, but form branching colonies that look like
fungi.<br>
Actinomyces species prefer non-acidic soils, are usually facultative anaerobes, but prefer anaerobic
environment.<br>
It can cause infections in cuts and abrasions in humans and cattle, e.g. actinomycosis.<br>
Actinomyces are anaerobic Gram-positive, non-acid-fast, fragment into coccil and bacilli and not form conidia; (e.g.

<h3>8.26 Lenski's experiments with Escherichia coli.</h3>
In the Long-Term Experimental Evolution Project, starting 24-2-1988, Richard Lenski, Michigan State University used
it to establish 12 populations of Escherichia coli.<br>
Then he studied succeeding generations of these separate populations for genotypic and phenotypic changes, e.g.
changes in cell size and growth rates on glucose.<br>
Every day, samples are transferred to a new nutrient medium.<br>
After 30 years, and about 30, 000 generations, some of these bacteria had evolved larger cells, faster growth rate
and the ability to metabolize citrate,
which they had never done before.<br>
These experiment provide long-term data on the genetics of bacteria and the rate of evolutionary change.<br>

<a href="../images/9.72.gif">See diagram 9.72</a>: Root nodules.<br>
Rhizobium leguminosarum, is used to study symbiotic nitrogen fixation in nodules on legume roots.<br>
Rhizobium can "fix" nitrogen from the air, which very few other living things can do.<br>
Nitrogen-fixing bacteria can fix aerobic nitrogen into combined nitrogen in the soil to be available to plants by
combining gaseous nitrogen with carbon and hydrogen to make organic molecules.<br>
Rhizobium radicicola bacteria enters the root hairs of some legumes and pass to the root cortex where they cause the
formation of lumps, called "root nodules".<br>
The fixed nitrogen compounds in the root nodules are available to other plants when the first plant dies and rots in
the soil.<br>
Seeds of legume crops, e.g. alfalfa, beans, clovers, peas, soybeans, may be inoculated with cultures of Rhizobium to
increase yield.<br>
Some legumes, e.g. cowpea and lablab bean, are grown until the flowering stage and then dug into the soil as "green
manure".<br>
When these plants rot, they leave nitrogen compounds in the soil, both from the leaves and root nodules.<br>
Different crop plants require different strains of Rhizobium.<br>
The strain of rhizobium found in peas, beans and clover has cilia over the whole cell.<br>
The strain of Rhizobium found in cowpea, peanut and Cassia has a single cilium at one end.<br>
Farmers can purchase commercial inoculum containing the strain appropriate for nodulation of their particular
crop.<br>
Experiment.<br>
Dig up different legume plants and count the number of nodules and note the sizes of the nodules.<br>
Cut open some nodules.<br>
The inside of a nodule that is fixing nitrogen is a pink red colour.<br>
Inactive nodules are brown or green inside.<br>

* Streptococcus lactis (Lactococcus), sours milk.<br>
* Streptococcus mutans, primary bacterium for plaque formation to cause tooth decay.<br>
It needs both glucose and fructose from the breakdown of sucrose in food and soft drinks to produce plaque and
lactic acid.<br>
Streptococcus mutans, and other oral bacteria in dental plaque on teeth, produce acids that dissolve tooth enamel
leading to cavities (caries), infection of the tooth pulp (pulpitis), infection of the gum (gingivitis),infection of
the gums and bone, (peridontitis) Vincent's disease (ulcerative gingivitis, trench mouth).<br>
* Streptococcus pneumoniae, is common in upper respiratory tract, invades the lower respiratory tract to cause
bacterial pneumonia, sinusitis, laryngitis, bronchitis, inflammation of the lungs, also, streptococcal meningitis,
otitis media.<br>
* Streptococcus pyrogenes, inflammation of the throat, sore throat, tonsillitis ("strep throat"), scarlet fever,
necrotizing fasciitis, (GAS), streptococcal toxic shock syndrome.<br>
* Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus is used for yoghurt production, with Lactobacillus bulgaricus.<br>
Lactobacillus acidophilus occurs naturally in the human gastrointestinal tract, mouth and vagina, and may be used
with Streptococcus salivarius (subsp. thermophilus), and with Lactobacillus delbrueckii (subsp. bulgaricus), to
produce acidophilus-type yoghurt.<br>
* Leuconostoc citrovorum with Streptococcus lactis convert lactic acid to aldehydes and ketones to produce
buttermilk with its characteristic flavour and aroma.<br>
Streptococcus thermophilus, ferments glucose and lactose at 50<sup>o</sup>C.<br>

<h3>Streptomyces</h3>
Phylum: Actinobacteria, Class: Actinobacteria, Order: Actinomycetales, Family: Streptomycetaceae.<br>
The Streptomyces vegetative mycelium does not fragment into short forms, but conidia form in chains from aerial
hyphae, e.g. Streptomyces griseus.<br>
Streptomyces bacteria grow in damp soil and form a dust of spores when the soil becomes dry.<br>
When rain hits the dry ground, an aerosol of water and soil can be breathed in to cause the "rain smell", "earth
smell", from the terpene geosmin, C12H22O, produced by Streptomyces antibioticus and Streptomyces coelicolor.<br>
Streptomyces antibioticus, Streptomyces griseus produce streptomycin antibiotic.<br>
Streptomyces scabies causes common scab of potatoes, turnips, beetroot, called "potato scab".<br>

Sepsis
One in five people worldwide die of sepsis, which occurs when bacteria enter the blood and rapidly grow,
triggering an inflammatory response cascade that causes septic shock, organ failure, and, if not treated quickly
enough, death.
In 40 per cent of cases, the type of bacteria causing the infection isn’t identified in time, making it difficult to
treat and causing
the cascade of bodily responses that can become fatal.
Pneumonia
The leading cause of death in children under five worldwide, pneumonia is an infection of the lungs that can be
caused by bacteria or viruses.
Symptoms include difficulty breathing, cough, fever or chills and phlegm.
Pneumonia caused by bacteria can be treated with antibiotics, and one of the most common types of pneumonia, caused
by the bacterium
treptococcus pneumoniae, can be prevented by vaccination.
Urinary tract infections (UTI)
These infections occur when bacteria enter and multiply in any part of the urinary system, most commonly in the
bladder and urethra.
UTIs are mainly caused by the bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli) and are the most common infection in humans
worldwide.
Symptoms include a burning sensation when urinating, blood in the urine, and strong-smelling urine.
While UTIs can usually be easily treated with antibiotics, they can cause death if they develop into sepsis.
An estimated one-third of sepsis cases begin as UTIs.
Meningitis
This infection of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord, the meninges, causes fever, neck stiffness
and pain, and a rash of purple
or red spots that remain when you press on them.
While this disease can be caused by a virus or a fungus, bacterial meningitis is the most severe type, and can turn
fatal within hours.
Wound infections
A wound in your body, whether from surgery or injury, allows bacteria to enter the body and cause disease.
An infected wound can swell, become red, feel warm, and ooze pus.
Chronic wounds affect 40 million people worldwide, including 420,000 Australians, each year.
The ageing population and increase in people with type 2 diabetes are drivers of an increase in chronic wounds.
If bacteria infecting a wound spread through the body and into the blood, it can trigger sepsis.
Tuberculosis (TB)
TB is a lower respiratory tract infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which infects the lungs.
It remains a major killer because of a rise in drug-resistant strains.
The vaccine against TB is one of the most widely used worldwide.

Diarrhoea
Diarrhoea is the second-leading cause of death in children under five worldwide, killing over half-a-million
children of this age globally each year.
Previously, most deaths from diarrhoea were caused by the accompanying dehydration, but sepsis resulting from
bacterial infection represents a
growing proportion.
Diarrhoea is a symptom of a range of infections, including bacterial, viral and fungal.
Infection with E. coli is one of the most common causes of diarrhoea.
