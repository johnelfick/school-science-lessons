Also, "Bacillus" refers to a genus of bacteria:<br>

Bacillus is a genus of Gram-positive, rod-shaped bacterium, with over 250 named species.<br>
some Bacillus species may be dependent on oxygen, but others can survive in the absence of oxygen.<br>
If not enough nutrients, a Bacillus cell can become a dormant endospore, which can survive for a long time. 
Family Bacillaceae contains Bacillus and Clostridium species.<br>
Bacillus species are resistant to antibiotics and may cause food spoilage.
Bacillus species are used to produce the enzyme alpha amylase for starch hydrolysis.<br>
Bacillus anthracis, causes disease anthrax, in hoofed animals, rarely in humans as cutaneous anthrax black scab (eschar), but may become fatal.<br>
Bacillus cereus, soil bacteria, may cause food poisoning (enterotoxins)<br>
Bacillus subtilis, is used for biotechnology and for teaching<br>

Bordetella pertusssis causes contagious whooping cough in children.<br>
In the healthy person, both the human genome and the microbiome, (of bacteria contribute to metabolic pathways.<br>
Bacteria contribute to the health of a person in the following ways:.<br>
* Toxin degeneration.<br>
* Micronutrient synthesis.<br>
* Glycan and amino acid metabolism.<br>
Microorganisms are used to make foods, e.g. yoghurt and cheese.<br>
However, but other microorganisms "spoil" food, if given the appropriate conditions of temperature, pH and moisture.<br>
Microbial contamination accounted for 34% of all food recalls by Food Standards Australia New Zealand, between 1-1-1990 and 31-12-2004.<br>
Recalls: 41% due to Listeria monocytogenes contamination, 19% due to Salmonella contamination and 13% due to (Escherichia coli) contamination.<br>
People most affected by food poisoning are the elderly, the young and immune suppressed individuals.<br>

<a href="../images/14.04chd.gif">See diagram 14.12</a>: Sulfanilamides, sulflilamide, sulfamethoxazole.<br>
Sulfanilamide, p-aminobenzenesulfonamide, Toxic if ingested, liver toxin.<br>
The first of the antibacterial drugs, the sulfonamides, were found effective against the cocci infections caused by the bacteria streptococci, gonococci and pneumococci.<br>
The basic compound is called sulfanilamide, (sulphanilamide, sulfamine, 4-aminobenzenesulfonamide), C6H8N2O2S.<br>
Many derivatives can be made from this compound by modifying the molecule to change its potency or reduce side effects or toxicity.<br>
The effectiveness of these drugs depends on maintaining the basic structure and shape of the molecule.<br>
One of the essential growth compounds for most bacteria susceptible to the sulfonamides is p-aminobenzoic acid, (4-aminobenzoic acid), C7H7NO2.<br>
Bacteria absorb a sulfonamide, because its shape and charge distribution is similar to p-aminobenzoic acid, and then they cannot metabolize it.<br>
Bacteria use p-aminobenzoic acid to produce folic acid, but, unlike humans, cannot absorb folic acid from their food.<br>
Prontosil sulfanilamide requires the patient to drink copious quantities of water at the same time, because kidney damage was caused by earlier products.<br>
The term "sulfanilamides" refers to the family of molecules based on sulfanilamide, so it is a chemical term.<br>
The term sulfonamide (sulfa drugs), refers to drugs based on sulfanilamide, so it is a medical term.<br>
Sulfonamides (sulfa drugs), do not kill bacteria, but prevent them growing and multiplying to allow natural immunity processes to deal with them.<br>
Sulfonamide acetylation<br>
Individual people fall into two genetic groups, those who acetylate drugs like sulfonamides fast and those who do so slowly.<br>
While 90% of Japanese and Chinese are fast acetylators, only 40% of Americans, (both black and white), acetylate drugs fast.<br>
Acetylation is often the first step in metabolizing and thus deactivating a drug.<br>
Slow acetylators are exposed to higher levels of a drug given at the same dose.<br>
The acetyl derivative of sulfa thiazole is not very soluble.<br>
It tended to block kidney tubules and lead to death, so it was replaced by sulfadiazine.<br>
The same acetylating enzyme deactivates some carcinogens, e.g. the aromatic amines benzidene and o-tolidine, used in dyestuff manufacture and as analytical reagents in the detection of blood and chlorine levels in water.<br>
Slow acetylators are at higher risk of bladder cancer from these chemicals.<br>
Examples of sulfa drugs:<br>
Sulfamethoxazole / trimethoprim, "TMP-SMZ", C10H11N3O3S, (Bactrim, Septra, Co-trimoxazole, Cotrim, Sulfatrim).<br>
Sulfasalazine, C18H14N4O5S, (Azulfidine, Sulfazine).<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="8.12H">8.12</a> Bacterial infections, germ theory, Pasteur, Koch.<br>
1. The symptoms of a bacterial infection are usually local redness, heat, swelling and local pain and sometimes the formation of pus.<br>
By contrast viral infections usually affect many parts of the body, e.g. blocked nose, cough and headache.<br>
However, local virus infections include conjunctivitis (pink eye, truck driver's eye), and herpes.<br>
Herpes is painful, but most viral diseases feel more like an itch.<br>
Pus is a yellow white viscous fluid formed in infected tissue, containing white blood cells (polymorphonuclear leucocytes) remains of cells, dead tissue, and micro-organisms.<br>
Pus should be surgically drained as soon as possible.<br>
Normal body temperature (orally) = 36.8 (+ or -) 0.5<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
Fever is occurs if body temperature = or &gt; 37.5<sup>o</sup>C (in the mouth), 37.2<sup>o</sup>C (under the arm), 38.0<sup>o</sup>C (rectum).<br>
2. Infections of the skin by Staphylococcus aureus include the following:<br>
* Infection of the hair follicles as small white head pimples at the base of hair shafts or as a swollen red boil (furuncle, carbuncle).<br>
* Impetigo blisters then crusts on the surface of the skin of young children.<br>
* Cellulitis infection below the skin surface.<br>
* Infection of the eyelid glands (hordeolum, stye).<br>
3. The germ theory developed by Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch identified the cause of diseases, anthrax, tuberculosis and plague.<br>
The principle of identification was set out in Koch's postulates in 1881:<br>
* The germ is always present in the disease.<br>
* The germ can be cultivated outside the body and preserved for generations.<br>
* The disease can be reproduced in experimental animals.<br>
* The organism causing the disease cannot be found in inoculated animals.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="8.5.5H">8.5.5</a> Pasteur's spontaneous generation experiment.<br>
It was believed that living organisms could develop from non-living matter without pre-existing living matter<br>
Also, it was believed that disease can develop spontaneously in damaged human tissue without any exterior organism being involved.<br>
In 1859. Louis Pasteur, tested this belief by putting boiled clear meat soup into a swan neck flask.<br>
Then the swan neck was heated to kill any living things in it.<br>
The swan neck flask was left standing while dust fell from the air and accumulated in the loop of the swan neck.<br>
Air from the atmosphere could still pass by the dust in the swan neck.<br>
The meat soup remained clear.<br>
Later, Pasteur tipped the flask so that the dust in the loop of the swan neck fell into the flask.<br>
The meat soup in the flask became cloudy, because of bacterial infection from the dust in the air.<br>

He used a spray of carbolic acid, (phenol C6H5OH), as a germicide to reduce mortality of post operative surgery.<br>
Common anti-bacterials are ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, synthetic detergents, (QAC, Quaternary Ammonium Compounds), and phenols.<br>
Phenols sterilize well, but are corrosive and toxic.<br>
Detergents and 70% alcohol have some microbiocidal effect, but are not sporicidal and dry out skin surfaces.<br>

<a href="../images/9.209.gif">See diagram 9.209</a>: TS Root nodule.<br>
<a href="../images/9.72.gif">See diagram 9.72</a>: Root nodules.<br>
Rhizobium leguminosarum, is used to study symbiotic nitrogen fixation in nodules on legume roots.<br>
Rhizobium can "fix" nitrogen from the air, which very few other living things can do.<br>
Nitrogen-fixing bacteria can fix aerobic nitrogen into combined nitrogen in the soil to be available to plants by combining gaseous nitrogen with carbon and hydrogen to make organic molecules.<br>
Rhizobium radicicola bacteria enters the root hairs of some legumes and pass to the root cortex where they cause the formation of lumps, called "root nodules".<br>
The fixed nitrogen compounds in the root nodules are available to other plants when the first plant dies and rots in the soil.<br>
Seeds of legume crops, e.g. alfalfa, beans, clovers, peas, soybeans, may be inoculated with cultures of Rhizobium to increase yield.<br>
Some legumes, e.g. cowpea and lablab bean, are grown until the flowering stage and then dug into the soil as "green manure".<br>
When these plants rot, they leave nitrogen compounds in the soil, both from the leaves and root nodules.<br>
Different crop plants require different strains of Rhizobium.<br>
The strain of rhizobium found in peas, beans and clover has cilia over the whole cell.<br>
The strain of Rhizobium found in cowpea, peanut and Cassia has a single cilium at one end.<br>
Farmers can purchase commercial inoculum containing the strain appropriate for nodulation of their particular crop.<br>
Experiment.<br>
Dig up different legume plants and count the number of nodules and note the sizes of the nodules.<br>
Cut open some nodules.<br>
The inside of a nodule that is fixing nitrogen is a pink red colour.<br>
Inactive nodules are brown or green inside.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="PneumoniaH">Pneumonia</a><br>
The leading cause of death in children under five worldwide, pneumonia is an infection of the lungs that can be caused by bacteria or viruses.<br> 
Symptoms include difficulty breathing, cough, fever or chills and phlegm.<br> 
Pneumonia caused by bacteria can be treated with antibiotics, and one of the most common types of pneumonia, caused by the bacterium 
treptococcus pneumoniae, can be prevented by vaccination.<br>
Urinary tract infections (UTI)
These infections occur when bacteria enter and multiply in any part of the urinary system, most commonly in the bladder and urethra.<br> 
UTIs are mainly caused by the bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli) and are the most common infection in humans worldwide.<br> 
Symptoms include a burning sensation when urinating, blood in the urine, and strong-smelling urine.<br> 
While UTIs can usually be easily treated with antibiotics, they can cause death if they develop into sepsis.<br> 
An estimated one-third of sepsis cases begin as UTIs.<br>

Wound infections<br>
A wound in your body, whether from surgery or injury, allows bacteria to enter the body and cause disease.<br> 
An infected wound can swell, become red, feel warm, and ooze pus.<br> 
Chronic wounds affect 40 million people worldwide, including 420,000 Australians, each year.<br> 
The ageing population and increase in people with type 2 diabetes are drivers of an increase in chronic wounds.<br> 
If bacteria infecting a wound spread through the body and into the blood, it can trigger sepsis.<br>

Diarrhoea is the second-leading cause of death in children under five worldwide, killing over half-a-million children of this age globally each year.<br> 
Previously, most deaths from diarrhoea were caused by the accompanying dehydration, but sepsis resulting from bacterial infection represents a 
growing proportion.<br> 
Diarrhoea is a symptom of a range of infections, including bacterial, viral and fungal.<br> 
Infection with E. coli is one of the most common causes of diarrhoea.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="SepsisH">Sepsis</a><br>
One in five people worldwide die of sepsis, which occurs when bacteria enter the blood and rapidly grow, triggering an inflammatory response cascade that causes septic shock, organ failure, and, if not treated quickly enough, death.<br> 
In 40 per cent of cases, the type of bacteria causing the infection isn’t identified in time, making it difficult to treat and causing the cascade of bodily responses that can become fatal.<br>

Bacteria can attack plants and cause them to rot.<br>
They live in damp places and cause many diseases, e.g. wilting of tomato plants, rotting of the heart of lettuce.<br>
Bacterial diseases include bacterial black spot of mangos, bacterial blight on mulberry trees and pea, bacterial brown spot of bean, bacterial canker of cherries and apricots, and bacterial canker on tomatoes.<br>
These diseases cannot usually be cured, but they can be prevented by soaking seeds in very hot water for a short time.<br>
