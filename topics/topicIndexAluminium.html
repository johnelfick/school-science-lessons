<a href="Table2.html#AlSH">Aluminium</a>, Table of the Elements<br>
1. Aluminium, Al (Latin <i>alumen</i> bitter salt, referring to alum), (US Aluminum), Aluminium ion, Al<sup>3+</sup><br>
In 1990, The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) confirmed the use of the spelling "aluminium".<br>
However, but people in the US are accustomed to using the spelling "aluminum".<br>
Aluminium is a silver, light, ductile, malleable, metal, with mechanical strength.<br>
Aluminium compounds are abundant.<br>
Aluminium is extracted by electrolysis from the main aluminium ore bauxite dissolved in cryolite.<br>
Bauxite is 8% of the earth's crust so aluminium is the most abundant element in the Earth's crust.<br>
Atomic number: 13, Relative atomic mass: 26.9815, r.d. 2.70, m.p. = 660<sup>o</sup>C, b.p. = 2470<sup>o</sup>C, E 173<br>
Specific heat capacity: 900 J kg<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup><br>
Aluminium availability:<br>
Aluminium, Al, metal filings, ion Al<sup>3+</sup>, granules (stabilized), pellets (coated) (powder 1396), Flammable powder<br>
Aluminium is available as foil, sheet, and wire.<br>
Aluminium foil, "Alfoil" cooking foil, aluminium foil, 300 width × 150 m roll, "Alfoil" disposable containers, rectangular 120 mm × 175 mm, round 120 mm diameter.<br>
Aluminium ignots, 99.7% purity<br>
Aluminium reagent test kit, No. 1 tablets, No. 2 tablets, AAS Std, leaf, flakes, sheet, drink-can, ingot, wire<br>
Aluminium, although toxic, is not a heavy metal.<br>
Low cost: Aluminum kitchen foil, aluminum drink cans (beverage cans, plastic coated inside), aluminum window screen frames<br>
Duralumin, alloy of Al + Cu + Mg<br>
Aluminium uses<br>
 1. Aluminium metal is not tarnished in air, because it forms protective oxide that prevents further oxidation.<br>
The aluminium foil used in home kitchens from grocery stores and the aluminium wire and aluminium sheeting from hardware stores are all pure aluminium.<br>
Most reactions of aluminium are inhibited by a surface coating of aluminium oxide.<br>
This is the reason that such an active metal as aluminium can be used widely for construction and for containers.<br>
Alfoil disposable containers + lid, 105 mm width × 184 mm depth × 38 mm height.<br>
Aluminium foil is used to clean pots and barbecue grill on picnics.<br>
Rub rust from and polish chromium plating, seal used paint tins and planting pots, catch baking drips.<br>
Aluminium is protected by layer of oxide that can be thickened if an anode in electrolytic cell, i.e. anodized then can be coloured, malleable, low density, used in "Alfoil" cooking foil, drink-cans, saucepans, cars, duralumin (alloy of Al + Cu, Mg), for aircraft bodies and struts, motor vehicle parts.<br>
Aluminium food additive, E173 (colour: metallic) (Banned, some countries, excess unsafe)<br>

Aluminium powder is not safe for school use, so it is not supplied as powder.<br>
So to avoid explosive reactions, do not grind aluminium metal to powder.<br>
Finely divided aluminium particles (powder or fine turnings) burn in air with an intense white flame if ignited.<br>
A significant amount of ultraviolet radiation is emitted, and the flame should not be watched with the naked eye.<br>
Unoxidized aluminium powder reacts vigorously with both concentrated acids or alkalis to yield hydrogen gas, which is explosive when mixed with air.<br>
The reaction may occur with such vigour that the aluminium particles and acid or alkali may be ejected from the container.<br>
Aluminium metal reacts violently with halogens (chlorine, bromine, iodine).<br>
The reaction of aluminium with liquid bromine is hazardous and should not be attempted.<br>

The original "alum" was the hydrated double salt of aluminium and potassium with colourless octahedral crystals and an astringent taste, used for mordants before dyeing cloth.<br>
Later the term "alum" was used to describe similar double sulfates where other elements, or radicals replaced aluminium or potassium.<br>
So an "alum" is a hydrated aluminium potassium sulfate and related minerals.<br>
Some plants with astringent roots are called "alum roots".<br>
Aluminium ions form alums that are complex hydrated metal sulfates that contain 12 or 24 H2O.<br>
"Alum" often refers to potassium alum, KAl(SO4)2·12H2O.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.1.1H">12.1.1</a> Aluminium with acids<br>
 Dissolve aluminium in heated dilute hydrochloric acid and note that hydrogen gas forms.<br>
 2Al + 6H<sup> +</sup> --> 2A1<sup>3+</sup> + 3H2 (g).<br>
 Hot concentrated sulfuric acid will attack aluminium with the production of sulfur dioxide.<br>
 Dilute or concentrated nitric acid acts only very slowly on aluminium.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.1.2H">12.1.2</a> Aluminium with sodium hydroxide<br>
 Use aluminium cooking foil or aluminium pie pans.<br>
 Use caustic soda drain cleaner from a hardware shop.<br>
 Wear safety goggles, gloves, lab coat.<br>
 Keep away any matches, sparks, flames.<br>
 If exploding hydrogen, wear ear protection.<br>
 Be careful! Hydrogen gas forms from the very rapid reaction.<br>
 1. Use a dropper to put drops of concentrated sodium hydroxide solution 
 onto a sheet of aluminium foil or aluminium powder in a test-tube.<br>
2. Add 5 g coarse aluminium powder to 20 ml of 40
% sodium hydroxide solution in a test-tube.<br>
 Quickly place the test-tube in the bottom of a tall glass beaker before 
 the violent react occurs.<br>
 The coarse aluminium powder has a surface layer of aluminium oxide, which
is first dissolved by the sodium hydroxide before the main reaction occurs.<br>
 The aluminium completely dissolves and the water acts here too as an 
acid.<br>
 (The aluminate ion in an anhydrous compound is shown as (AlO2<sup>-</sup>), 
 and in the hydrated form is shown as Al(OH)4<sup>-</sup>.<br>
 2Al (s) + 2NaOH (aq) + 2H2O (l) --> 2NaAlO2 (aq) + 3H2 (g) + energy.<br>
 2Al + 2OH<sup>-</sup> + 2H2O --> 2AlO2<sup>- 
</sup>+ 3H2 (g)<br>
 2Al (s) + 2NaOH (aq) + 6H2O --> 2Na<sup>+</sup> (aq) + 2Al(OH)4<sup>-</sup>
+ 3H2 (g)<br>
 The following equations show the aluminium reacting with water to form 
the amphoteric aluminium hydroxide, Al(OH)3, which later goes in solution to produce aluminates, (Al(OH)4)<sup>-</sup>.<br>
 2Al + 6H2O --> 2Al(OH)3 + 3H2<br>
 Al(OH)3 + NaOH --> Na<sup>+</sup> + Al(OH)4<sup>-</sup><br>
 Al2O3 + 2NaOH + 3H2O --> 2Na<sup>+</sup> 
 + 2Al(OH)4<sup>-</sup><br>
Sold as "drain cleaners", e.g. <i>Drano</i>, contains sodium hydroxide crystals and pieces of aluminium, which react as above when put in a wet clogged drain.<br>
The reaction is very hot as the sodium hydroxide reacts with fats to form soaps, the hydrogen applies pressure to move the pieces of aluminium to whirl around and cut the blockage.<br>
3. Stand a clear glass bottle in a container of water.<br>
Do not use a plastic drink bottle!<br>
Add water to the bottle to 1/3 volume and add water to the container so the water levels in the bottle and container are the same.<br>
 Add a small measured amount of caustic soda to the bottle.<br>
 Pick up the bottle, dissolve the caustic soda by swirling the bottle, then replace the bottle in the container.<br>
 Roll a sheet of aluminium foil into a tube to fit through the mouth of the bottle.<br>
 Attach a balloon to the mouth of the bottle so that it fills with hydrogen gas.<br>
 Attach a balloon clip and let the balloon float up in the air.<br>
If the balloon does not float up in the air, because it is not full enough, wait until the bottle has cooled and repeat the experiment with more caustic soda and aluminium foil.<br>
If the balloon does not float up in the air, and feels heavy, because the reaction has been too vigorous so some water has condensed in the balloon, wait until the bottle has cooled and repeat the experiment with>less caustic soda and aluminium foil.<br>

 Use &lt; 5 g total material of iodine to react with aluminium powder in a fume cupboard.<br>
 However, be aware that a cloud of unreacted iodine vapour may be released.<br>
 Fine particles of aluminium react violently with iodine, especially after a drop of water has been added.<br>
 A large amount of unreacted iodine is liberated as purple vapour into the air.<br>
 This reaction should only be done with &lt; 5 g of materials and in a fume cupboard or outdoors.<br>
 Mix the ingredients in a small ceramic mortar and pestle.<br>
 All observers must wear eye protection.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.1.4H">12.1.4</a> Burn aluminium in oxygen<br>
Sprinkle aluminium powder onto a Bunsen burner flame or heat aluminium powder in a crucible, then lower it into a gas jar of oxygen.<br>
The aluminium burns brightly to form the white powder magnesium oxide.<br>
 4Al (s) + 3O2 (g) --> 2Al2O3 (s)<br>
 aluminium + oxygen --> aluminium oxide<br>
 Aluminium oxide is an amphoteric oxide that does not dissolve in water.<br>
 Stored aluminium is always coated with aluminium oxide, which protects it from most chemical reactions.<br>
 So aluminium can be used for many purposes where an unreacted metal is needed.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.1.6H">12.1.6</a> Aluminium with sulfur<br>
 Mix dry aluminium powder with twice its volume of sulfur powder.<br>

 Be careful! Larger quantities may explode! Set up a safety screen.<br>
 Clamp the test-tube vertically and heat with a Bunsen burner.<br>
 Note the vigorous action where aluminium sulfide is synthesized.<br>
 Leave to cool, then add drops of water.<br>
 Hydrogen sulfide forms, because of the hydrolysis of the aluminium sulfide.<br>
 2Al + 3S --> Al2S3<br>

2. Add drops of sodium hydroxide to aluminium sulfate solution.<br>
 Note the white precipitate that dissolves in excess sodium hydroxide to form sodium aluminate.<br>
 Aluminium hydroxide is amphoteric.<br>
 Al(OH)3 + OH<sup>-</sup> --> AlO<sup>2-</sup> + 2H2O<br>
3. Add blue litmus solution to aluminium sulfate solution.<br>
 The blue litmus turns red.<br>
 Add sodium carbonate solution and note the production of carbon dioxide.<br>
 Aluminium salts in solution can act as acids, because of hydrolysis.<br>
 Al<sup>3+</sup> + 3H2O --> Al(OH)3 + 3H<sup> +</sup><br>
4. Pass hydrogen sulfide through aluminium sulfate solution to produce the hydroxide, not the sulfide.<br>
5. Mix aluminium sulfate with twice its volume of anhydrous sodium carbonate and heat it on a charcoal block.<br>
 Note the white infusible mass.<br>
 Add cobalt nitrate solution and heat again.<br>
 A bright blue solid forms.<br>

 Be careful! Demonstrate this reaction only to senior students.<br>
 Place &lt; 5 g of aluminium chloride in a beaker in a fume cupboard and add water drop-by-drop.<br>
 The material will hiss, crackle and release clouds of hydrogen chloride and fine particles.<br>
 Anhydrous aluminium chloride, AlCl3, reacts violently with water to form the hydrated salt by hydrolysis, and a solution of H<sup>+</sup> ions and Cl<sup>-</sup>ions (a solution of hydrochloric acid) and hydrogen chloride
 gas.<br>
 The formation of an acid solution is more typical of a non-metal rather than a metal and this reflects the position of aluminium to the right of magnesium in the periodic table.<br>
 Fine aerosol particles may also be generated.<br>
 Both the hydrogen chloride gas and the fine particles are extremely irritant to the lungs.<br>
 Aluminium chloride should only be used in a fume cupboard and only in small amounts.<br>
 Do not mix aluminium chloride with alkaline materials, e.g. sodium hydroxide, because a violent reaction may occur.<br>
 Aluminium chloride is exceedingly hygroscopic so keep it in a tightly-sealed plastic container.<br>
 Purchase the material only in small amounts, e.g. 100 g.<br>
 Aluminium bromide, AlBr3, has dangerous properties similar to anhydrous aluminium chloride.<br>
 AlCl3 (S) + 3H2O (l) --> Al(OH)3 (s) + 3H<sup>+</sup> (aq) + 3Cl<sup>-</sup> (aq)<br>

<a href="./images/12.1.10.gif">See diagram 12.1.10</a> : Alumina as a catalyst<br>
Large quantities of alumina, aluminium (III) oxide, are used in the cracking processes in oil refineries.<br>
One of the products, ethylene gas, C2H2, is used in the petrochemical industry to produce polyethylene and other polymers.<br>
Activate alumina is very porous and is used as a filter for water treatment, an adsorption desiccant and a catalyst for natural gas and oil refining processes.<br>
Experiment<br>
Use a fume hood for this experiment.<br>
Hot paraffin oil and ethylene gas are flammable.<br>
Set up the apparatus as in diagram 12.1.10.<br>
<a href="./images/12.1.10.gif">See diagram 12.1.10</a> : Alumina as a catalyst.<br>
Put 5 cm of paraffin oil and boiling chips in the boiling tube.<br>
Clamp it at a shallow angle, then put 0.5 g of alumina powder half way down the boiling tube.<br>
Replace the stopper.<br>
First heat the alumina strongly with a Bunsen burner, then heat the alumina and paraffin oil alternately until the paraffin oil boils and its vapour passes over the alumina.<br>
Let the first few bubbles of gas escape under the fume hood, then collect two test-tubes of gas.<br>
Fix stoppers on the test-tubes.<br>
Immediately after collecting the two test-tubes of gas, turn off the Bunsen burner and remove the delivery tube and stopper from under the boiling tube.<br>
This action prevents water "sucking back" into the boiling tube as it cools.<br>

Anti-bumping granules, boiling chips (- ceramic, silicon carbide, fused alumina)<br>
Boiling chips, usually fused alumina, also flower pot bits, prevents large bubbles of gas forming that could cause explosive emissions from a beaker containing a heated solution.<br>
Sudden formation of a large amount of vapour from the bottom of a heated vessel of liquid, rather than the usual controlled boiling.<br>
So boiling chips (anti-bumping granules) are added to chemical reactions to keep the bubbles small and aid steady boiling.<br>
Hydrocarbons with longer chains will have higher boiling points than similar hydrocarbons with branched chains, because they have more van der Waals intermolecular bonds between one molecule and another molecule.<br>

 Add 100 mL of 20% sodium hydroxide solution and boil under reflux for 1-2 hours.<br>
 Leave to cool, then transfer the solution and residue to a 200 mL volumetric flask.<br>
 To make sure all the contents of the reflux are transferred, use demineralized water.<br>
 Leave to cool, then make up to volume with demineralized water.<br>
 When the muddy residue has settled overnight, remove a 10 mL aliquot to a 250 mL beaker and dilute to 100 mL with demineralized water.<br>
 Heat the mixture until it boils, then make acid with 1: 1 HCl using methyl red indicator.<br>
 Add 2 g of ammonium chloride, then add 1: 1 ammonium hydroxide until the yellow end point is reached.<br>
 Boil the mixture to coagulate the precipitate, then filter it while still hot and wash the precipitate on the filter paper with hot water.<br>
 Leave the precipitate and filter paper overnight to dry to a slightly damp consistency.<br>
 Transfer the precipitate to a weighed crucible, e.g. porcelain, silica or platinum.<br>
 Dry the precipitate on the edge of a hot plate.<br>
 Do not allow any material to be lost by spitting.<br>
 Transfer the crucible and contents to a muffle furnace and ignite to a constant weight at 1, 0000 to 1, 200<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 Leave the crucible and contents to cool in a desiccator, then weigh them.<br>
 Calculate the percentage of alumina in the the bauxite: (weight of crucible and residue - weight of crucible) × 20 × 100 / weight of the sample.<br>
 If the "mud" is left with the solution it contributes to less than 1% of the total volume, an almost insignificant error.<br>
 The alumina content can also be determined volumetrically with EDTA.<br>
