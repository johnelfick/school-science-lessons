<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.4.0H">12.4.0</a> Magnesium, properties<br>
Magnesium, Mg, (Greek<i> magnesia</i>, mineral from Magnesia), alkaline earth metal, as powder, ribbon, turnings, wire (photographers' flash bulbs, light 
bulbs, fire starters, cars, aircraft bodies, alloyed with Al)<br>
Magnesium pencil sharpeners, with the iron blade removed, are about 95% magnesium, they are a cheap source of magnesium.<br>
Magnesium is Toxic if ingested, silver white alkaline earth metal, 2% of the earth's crust, forms protective oxide layer in air that prevents further oxidation.<br>
Magnesium burns in air with intense white light.<br>
It is available as powder (FLAM, dangerous), and ribbon (FLAM, safest form for school use) and as turnings (FLAM) low density.<br>
It is extracted from sea water, found in magnesite, (MgCO3) and dolomite, (MgCO3.CaCO3).<br>
Reacts with dilute HCl or (H2SO4 to form H2) and metal ion, reacts with concentrated oxidizing acids, (HNO3) or (H2SO4) to produce high oxidation number ions, and sulfur dioxide or nitrogen dioxide.<br>
Reacts with hot water, halogens, sulfur and nitrogen.<br>
Heated powder forms oxide.<br>
Magnesium is stored in bones and takes part in many adenosine triphosphate, ATP, reactions.<br>
The recommended daily allowance, RDA, is 350 mg for adult males, and 280 mg for adult females.<br>
Manganese is a cofactor for many enzymes, but magnesium can usually substitute for it.<br>
Magnesium with aluminium is used to make light weight alloys for use in aircraft, racing cars, bicycles.<br>
Atomic number: 12, Relative atomic mass: 24.305, RD 1.74, MP. = 650<sup>o</sup>C, BP = 1110<sup>o</sup>C<br>

Magnesium powder is too dangerous for school use<br>
Magnesium powder dispersed in air is explosive and may explode on contact with oxidizing agents, e.g. metal nitrates or chlorates and should not be combined with carbon tetrachloride, carbon dioxide, chlorinated hydrocarbons, and halogens.<br>
Magnesium ribbon is easily ignited and burns very exothermically, almost instantaneously, with a white hot flame that emits UV radiation and may cause eye damage.<br>
Use &lt; 1 cm of magnesium ribbon in experiments.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.4.5H">12.4.5</a> Re-lighting candles<br>
Re-lighting candles, (happy birthday candles you can't blow out!), "Trick Candles", "Magic candles"<br>
The relatively low autoignition temperature, 473<sup>o</sup>C, is used in trick happy birthday candles that cannot be blown out.<br>
When a candle is blown out, a glowing ember usually remains in the wick, but it does not provide enough heat to ignite the paraffin.<br>
The wicks of trick candles contain particles of magnesium powder, which may be ignited by the glowing ember to then ignite any remaining paraffin vapour.<br>
Look closely at the wick of a trick candle just before it reignites to see sparks of burning magnesium powder.<br>
Only the magnesium in the glowing ember ignites, so the trick candle can be blown out then reignites many times, because the magnesium in the rest of the wick does not burn, being isolated from the air by the liquid paraffin.<br>
Extinguish the trick candles by putting them in water.<br>
Put away the trick candle for storage only after several minutes and be sure that they are extinguished.<br>
The wicks of re-lighting candles should be &lt; 6 mm.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="8.2.16H">8.2.16</a> Heat magnesium ribbon to form magnesium oxide<br>
 Use magnesium ribbon, because magnesium powder is too reactive.<br>
 Be careful!<br>
 Do not heat magnesium powder!<br>
 Magnesium has density 1.74 g / cm<sup>3 </sup>and melting point 650<sup>o</sup>C, but magnesium oxide has density 3.58 g /cm<sup>3</sup> and melting point
 2 800<sup>o</sup>C, because the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-- O<sup>2-</sup> chemical bond is stronger than the Mg -- Mg bond.<br>
Experiments<br>
Experiment 1. Polish 3 cm of magnesium ribbon with emery paper, then use tongs to hold it in a flame.<br>
 When the magnesium ignites, hold it out of the flame and over an evaporating basin.<br>
 Do not look directly at the burning magnesium, because it emits a very bright light.<br>
 The magnesium takes fire and burns with a white, dazzling flame, leaving a white ash.<br>
Magnesium burns more easily than iron, forming white magnesium oxide, the ash.<br>
 Do not heat magnesium powder, because it may explode!<br>
 2Mg (s) + O2 (g) --> 2MgO (s)<br>
 magnesium + oxygen --> magnesium oxide.<br>
Experiment 2. The magnesium ash appears lighter than the original magnesium ribbon.<br>
 To test this observation, weigh a clean dry crucible with lid, add a 15 cm coil of polished magnesium ribbon, then weigh the crucible with lid + magnesium.<br>
 Use a Bunsen burner flame to heat the crucible on a pipe clay triangle.<br>
 Occasionally raise the lid slightly with tongs to allow air to enter the crucible.<br>
 When burning ceases, heat the crucible for a short time without the lid, then leave the crucible to cool with the lid on.<br>
 Weigh the crucible with lid + ash.<br>
 The weight of the crucible with lid + ash &gt; weight of crucible with lid + magnesium ribbon, because oxygen from the air had combined with the magnesium to form magnesium oxide.<br>
Experiment 3. Repeat the experiment with the coil of magnesium covered with 1 cm thickness of sodium chloride.<br>
 After heating, the magnesium does not change in weight, because the layer of salt prevented the magnesium from contacting oxygen in the air.<br>
Experiment 4. Hold a 10 cm strip of magnesium ribbon in a pair of tongs.<br>
 Place the ribbon in a Bunsen burner flame until it starts to burn.<br>
 Be careful! Magnesium burns with a very bright white light.<br>
 Magnesium ribbon corrodes slightly in air and burns with an intense white flame to form a white ash of magnesium oxide.<br>
 Mg + O2 --> MgO.<br>
Experiment 5. Clean 25 cm of magnesium ribbon and cut into pieces 1 cm long.<br>
 Put the pieces into a crucible with a lid.<br>
 Weigh the crucible + lid + contents = W1.<br>
 Put the crucible on a pipe clay triangle on a tripod stand.<br>
 Heat gently then strongly.<br>
 Use tongs to raise the lid.<br>
 The magnesium darkens before it melts.<br>
 When the magnesium starts to burn, put the lid back on the crucible and remove the burner.<br>
 Every few seconds raise the lid slightly to let more air enter.<br>
 Do not let white magnesium oxide smoke escape.<br>
 When the magnesium does not burn after you raise the lid, remove the lid and heat the crucible strongly.<br>
 Hold the lid ready in case the magnesium starts to burn again.<br>
 Let the crucible cool.<br>
 Again weigh the crucible + lid + contents = W2.<br>
 Note W2 &gt; W1.<br>
 The formation of magnesium oxide causes the increase in weight.<br>
Experiment 6. Reports on "To derive the empirical formula of MgO"<br>
Report 1. I have been unable to obtain useful data when burning magnesium.<br>
My problems have been, igniting the Mg, keeping the Mg burning and recording little or no mass gain.<br>
We ended up with a gain in mass, not what you would expect based on the mass used, though it gave us something to talk about regarding errors and accuracy.<br>
Report 2. Use a coiled longer piece and make sure that as much of it as possible is in contact with the crucible.<br>
Leave the lid off until it ignites, then whilst still heating keep cracking the lid, (tongs holding crucible lid) to let more O2 in without releasing too much ash until the reaction appears complete.<br>
Report 3. Sand the magnesium before experimenting to remove the oxide layer and then placed the magnesium within the crucible, leaving the lid open until it was just going to react.<br>
Report 4. Our gas lines in the laboratory lose pressure around the room, so it took some time to get the magnesium fully burnt.<br>
Very carefully, we lifted the crucible lid slightly, but moving it up and down a bit in a fanning type of action, to get air into it.<br>
We did this many times during 20 to 30 minutes, to get a good burn.<br>
Each time, as the magnesium glowed well and started burning to produce white smoke, we put the lid down to trap all products.<br>
We kept on going with the heating and letting air in, until the magnesium appeared fully burnt and not lighting up any more.<br>
Each student group were given a different length of magnesium - 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 cm).
The result was that the ratio was almost exactly 1:1 for every student group.

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="13.3.6H">13.3.6</a> Reactions of magnesium  oxide<br>
 Magnesium oxide is a metallic oxide, and is therefore basic.<br>
 Magnesium oxide has a low solubility in water.<br>
 Dilute hydrochloric acid reacts rapidly with aqueous magnesium hydroxide, but slowly with solid magnesium oxide.<br>
 Magnesium oxide dissolves slowly in water.<br>
 Phenolphthalein is an indicator that shows changes in alkalinity of the  solution.<br>
 An equilibrium is established between solid magnesium oxide and dissolved  magnesium ions.<br>
 The addition of acid disrupts the equilibrium by removing hydroxide  ions from the solution.<br>
 An equilibrium is established between solid magnesium oxide and dissolved  magnesium ions.<br>
 The addition of acid disrupts the equilibrium by removing hydroxide  ions from the solution.<br>
 Equilibrium is restored by slow dissolving of more magnesium oxide.<br>
 Addition of larger drops or higher concentration of acid causes a larger initial excess of acid in the solution.<br>
 Because the reaction of acid with the solid magnesium oxide is slow,  it will take a much longer time for the pink colour to return to the  mixture.<br>
 The magnesium oxide formed from combustion of magnesium ribbon forms  a hard mass with a small surface area for reaction.<br>
 The rate of reaction with acid, and the rate of solution of the solid  to form an alkaline solution, would be increased by crumbling the ash.<br>
 Magnesium oxide is used as a component of refractory crucibles, fire bricks, magnesia cements and  boiler scale compounds, as a reflector in optical instruments.<br>
 Magnesium oxide fume, airborne magnesium oxide and magnesia fume is an  odourless white opaque smoke.<br>
 Solid magnesium oxide is a hygroscopic fine white powder.<br>
 It is slightly soluble in water, pH of a saturated aqueous solution is 10.3.<br>
 It is soluble in dilute acids and ammonium salts.<br>
 It reacts violently with strong acids and halogens.<br>
 Breathing freshly generated magnesium oxide fume can irritate the eyes and nose.<br>

1. Put 10 mL of an M copper (II) sulfate solution in a small beaker.<br>
 Clean magnesium ribbon and cut into 0.5 cm pieces.<br>
 Add these pieces to the copper (II) sulfate solution one at a time.<br>
 Copper metal deposits and the blue colour gradually disappears as the magnesium displaces the copper ion.<br>
 Note any heat given out by the reaction.<br>
 When the solution is colourless, decant the solution from the red copper powder at the bottom of the beaker.<br>
 Collect the copper and dry it.<br>
 Mg (s) + Cu<sup>2+</sup> (aq) --> Mg<sup>2+</sup> (aq) + Cu (s)<br>

Sparkler experiments<br>
1. Light a fireworks "sparkler" and place the lighted end in a gas jar containing carbon dioxide.<br>
 <b>Be Careful!</b><br>
 The sparkler continues to burn, because it contains magnesium powder that reacts with the carbon dioxide.<br>
 When the sparkler has finished burning, all the carbon dioxide has reacted with the magnesium in the sparkler.<br>
2. Fill a gas jar with carbon dioxide.<br>
Hold a piece of clean magnesium ribbon in a pair of tongs.<br>
Ignite the magnesium with a Bunsen burner flame and plunge it into the carbon dioxide gas.<br>
The magnesium continues to burn.<br>
If the magnesium is taking oxygen from the carbon dioxide for burning then carbon would be left in the gas jar.<br>
Look for carbon specks in the gas jar and see tiny black specks of carbon on the inside of the cylinder.<br>
The carbon can be made more visible by adding drops of sulfuric acid to the inside of the gas jar to remove the magnesium oxide and any unburned magnesium.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.1.14H">5.1.14</a> Relative atomic mass of magnesium<br>
<a href="../images/5.1.14.gif">See diagram 5.1.14</a>: Relative atomic mass of magnesium<br>
The molar volume of most gases at 0<sup>o</sup>C and 1 atmosphere is 22.4 litres.<br>
The molar volume of most gases at 25<sup>o</sup>C and 1 atmosphere is 24.4 litres.<br>
In this experiment, the volume of hydrogen gas produced and mass of magnesium reacting with dilute hydrochloric acid are used to calculate the mass of magnesium that would be needed to produce one mole of hydrogen molecules, the relative atomic mass.<br>
The relative atomic mass (atomic weight, standard atomic weight), is the ratio of the average mass of one atom of an element to one twelfth of the mass of an atom of carbon-12.).<br>
1. Clean 4 cm of magnesium ribbon (3.5 mm standard ribbon) with fine emery paper and cut off a 3.5 cm length, weighing about
 0.03 g.<br>
 Use a top pan balance, accurate to +/- 0.001 g.<br>
2. Pour 25 mL of 2 M hydrochloric acid into a 50 cm<sup>2</sup> burette.<br>
Very carefully, pour 25 mL of water on top of the hydrochloric acid, leaving a space between the liquid and the top of the burette.<br>
The two solutions should not mix much.<br>
3. Push the length of magnesium ribbon by the middle to be just inside into the open end of the burette.<br>
Curl the magnesium ribbon around so that it stays in place like a spring under tension.<br>
4. Pour water into a beaker, close the top opening of the burette with your finger and quickly invert the burette so that the lower end is under the water.<br>
5. Clamp the burette to a burette stand and quickly note the inverted burette reading on the scale before the magnesium starts reacting with the acid.<br>
The liquid level in the burette must start on the graduated scale.<br>
If it is not on the scale turn the tap on and off quickly to let the level drop to be on the scale.<br>
6. When all the magnesium has reacted with the downwards diffusing acid and no more gas bubbles form, because all the magnesium has reacted, note the inverted burette reading again.<br>
Calculate the difference in burette readings, about 30.5 cm<sup>3</sup>.<br>
<hr width="100%" size="2">7. Mg (s) + 2HCl (l) --> MgCl2 (l) + H2 (g)<br>
So 1 mole of magnesium produces 1 mole of hydrogen molecules, i.e. 24.4 litres = 24, 400 cm<sup>3</sup> of hydrogen gas.<br>
If 0.03 g of magnesium produces 30.5 cm<sup>3</sup> of hydrogen gas, the mass of magnesium needed to produce 24, 400 cm<sup>3</sup> of hydrogen gas = 24, 400 × 0.03 / 30.5 = 24 g.<br>
So the relative atomic mass of magnesium is 24.8.<br>
Use the gas equations to convert the volume of gas collected at room temperature and actual atmospheric pressure to conditions under standard temperature and pressure.<br>
However, the hydrogen gas is mixed with water vapour so subtract the vapour pressure of water, at that room temperature.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.10.1H">12.10.1</a> Reactions of magnesium with water<br>
 1. At room temperature magnesium powder slowly forms hydrogen with water.<br>
Clean a magnesium pencil sharpener of piece of magnesium ribbon with sandpaper to remove the magnesium oxide and add a drop of water.<br>
 Tiny bubbles of hydrogen gas form, but this may occur only after a few days.<br>
 These tiny bubbles can be used as a test for magnesium.<br>
 Mg (s) + 2H2O (l) --> ; Mg(OH)2 (aq) + H2 (g) + energy<br>
 magnesium + water --> magnesium hydroxide + hydrogen<br>
The magnesium hydroxide formed is only slightly soluble in water to form an alkaline solution, pH 12-14.<br>
This is a type of redox reaction where the oxidation number of the metal increases.<br>
2. Magnesium burns brilliantly in steam.<br>

 It is a very dangerous experiment that has caused injuries in schools.<br>
 Magnesium powder should never be heated and is too reactive for most school experiments.<br>
 Mg + 2H2O --> Mg(OH)2 + H2 + energy<br>
2. The reaction may be so hot that the magnesium can react with nitrogen in the air.<br>
 3Mg + N2 --> Mg3N2 + energy<br>
3. Do not try to use water to control burning magnesium, because more explosive hydrogen gas may be formed.<br>
 Mg + H2O --> MgO + H2 + energy<br>
4. Carbon dioxide liberated from a soda acid fire extinguisher may release even more energy.<br>
 2Mg + CO2 --> 2MgO + C + energy<br>

3. Add of ammonium chloride to magnesium sulfate solution, then add ammonium carbonate solution or ammonia solution, NH3

Note a white precipitate of basic carbonate forms, because the increased concentration of ammonium ion, from the ammonium chloride, suppresses the ionization of the ammonia solution, NH3 (aq), ("ammonium hydroxide"), to leave insufficient hydroxyl ions to attain the solubility product of magnesium hydroxide.<br>

 Put 2 cm of magnesium ribbon loosely in the combustion tube.<br>
 Heat the flask slowly until a reaction action begins, then remove the

 The reaction produces nitrogen, which combines with magnesium to form 
 magnesium nitride, (Mg3N2).<br>
 The U-tube allows the steam to condense steam and prevent it passing

Do this experiment in a fume cupboard.<br>
Wear protective clothing, heat-resistant gloves and safety goggles.<br>
Have a dry-powder fire extinguisher nearby.<br>
Do not look directly at the burning magnesium.<br>
Do not use cracked glassware.<br>
Magnesium reacts easily with oxygen in the air to form a protective coating of magnesium oxide.<br>
Magnesium burns in oxygen with an intense white flame that can hurt the eyes.<br>
So magnesium has been used in fireworks and photographic flashlights.<br>
1. When a strip of magnesium burning in air is dipped into a gas jar of oxygen it burns with a more intense white flame
to form a white powder, magnesium oxide.<br>
 2Mg (s) + O2 (g) --> 2MgO (s) + energy<br>
 magnesium + oxygen --> magnesium oxide<br>
The magnesium has been oxidized (oxidation number increases) and the oxygen has been reduced (oxidation number decreased).<br>
The ionic compound magnesium oxide is a basic oxide, which dissolves slightly in water to form an alkaline solution about pH10.<br>
2. Wrap a 3 cm piece of magnesium ribbon around the loop at the end of a wire.<br>
Ignite it in a burner and put it quickly in the oxygen.<br>
Magnesium burns with a very bright flame.<br>
<b>Be Careful!</b><br>
Do not look directly at the flame, because its brightness can cause injury to the eyes.<br>
The white smoke is magnesium oxide, its toxicity is low, but inhalation should be avoided.<br>
Put the ash on a watch glass and add 3 mL of deionized water to wet the ash thoroughly and leave it lying in a small pool of water.<br>
Add one small drop of phenolphthalein solution and leave to stand for two minutes.<br>
Magnesium oxide has a low solubility in water, so there is no visible evidence that any of the solid has dissolved.<br>
Add one drop of dilute hydrochloric acid solution and leave to stand until the solution around the solid ash will turn pink, showing that the solution has become alkaline.<br>
This is the evidence that some magnesium oxide has dissolved.<br>
Oxide ions in the solid react with water to form aqueous hydroxide ions.<br>
When no further change occurs, add a second drop of dilute hydrochloric acid.<br>
The pink colour disappears almost instantly, showing that the hydroxide ions have been neutralized very quickly, and replaced by an excess of hydrogen ions.<br>
During the next 2 to 15 minutes, depending on the size and concentration of the drop of acid added, the mixture changes slowly back to pink as the excess acid is being neutralized slowly by solid magnesium oxide, followed by slow dissolving of remaining magnesium oxide to make the solution.<br>
When no more changes occur, add a second small drop of dilute hydrochloric acid.<br>
The same cycle of discharge and reappearance of pink colour can be repeated for as long as any solid magnesium oxide remains.<br>
3. Burn 6 cm of magnesium ribbon in the air over a piece of paper.<br>
Add water to the remaining white magnesium oxide solid, add water in a beaker, boil and test with red litmus paper.<br>
The litmus paper slowly turns blue showing the magnesium oxide solution to be weakly alkaline.<br>

Manganese is a white-grey colour, very hard, brittle transition metal, available as electrolytic flake and manganese (IV) oxide, (manganese dioxide), extracted by electrolytic treatment of ores, e.g. pyrolusite.<br>(manganese (IV) oxide) used in ferromanganese, for alloy steel manufacture.<br>
Manganese is a cofactor for many enzymes, but magnesium can usually substitute for it.<br>
The properties of manganese are similar to iron, but manganese is harder, more brittle, but less refractory.<br>
It is used to produce ferromanganese to improve hardness, stiffness, and strength of carbon steel, stainless steel, high temperature steel, and tool steel, also in non-ferrous alloys with aluminium, magnesium, copper and zinc.<br>
