 Tartar emetic, K(SbO)C4H4O6.<abbr></abbr>H2O, crystalline, poisonous, but used as expectorant and to treat schistosomiasis.<br>
 1. Prepare antimony sulfide colloidal solution.<br>
 Put 20 drops of yellow ammonium sulfide into a boiling tube full of water.<br>
 Put tartar emetic in another boiling tube and fill with water.<br>
 Mix equal volumes of the two solutions to produce the colloidal solution and test it as follows: .<br>
 1.1 Add sodium chloride.<br>
 Precipitation occurs.<br>
 1.2 Add iron (III) hydroxide solution.<br>
 Coagulation occurs, because the particles in the two solutions have opposite charges.<br>
 Iron (III) hydroxide sol is positively charged and antimony sulfideis negatively charged.<br>
 2. The effect of alteration of concentration, hydrolysis of antimony chloride.<br>
 Put antimony chloride in a test-tube and add 1 mL of water.<br>
 Note the white precipitate of antimony oxychloride.<br>
 Add drops of concentrated hydrochloric acid until the white precipitate disappears.<br>
 Add drops of water until the reappearance of antimony oxychloride, SbOCl.<br>
 SbCl3 + H2O --> SbOCl (s) + 2HCl.<br>
 3. Add 2 mL of starch solution to 2 mL of antimony sulfide solution.<br>
 Add sodium chloride solution.<br>
 The sodium chloride solution has no effect where the solution is protected by the starch.<br>
 4. Dilute 2 mL of the antimony sulfide solution with 2 mL of water to act as a control.<br>
 Add sodium chloride solution.<br>
 The sodium chloride solution coagulates the control.<br>

<a name="12.2.2.0H">12.2.2.0</a> Arsenic, As<br>
Arsenic is widespread and abundant in the earth.<br>
It is used in dyes, pigments, medicines, lead shot alloy, glass-making, fireworks.<br>
Arsenic and arsenic compounds are not use in school science experiments, because these substances are very poisonous.<br>
The two forms are yellow arsenic, S.G. 1.97 and grey arsenic, metallic arsenic S.G. 5.73, respectively.<br>
It has steel grey colour and is a very brittle, crystalline, semimetallic solid, a metalloid solid.<br>
It tarnishes in air.<br>
When heated it oxidizes to arsenous oxide, which has a garlic odour.<br>
 Heated arsenic (III) oxide gives off the garlic smell of arsenic and a black ring of arsenic in the test-tube.<br>
 Arsenic (III) oxide is amphoteric and is slightly soluble in water.<br>
Arsenic occurs in realgar As4S4, orpiment As2S3, arsenolite As2O3, and arsenopyrite FeAsS.<br>
 Arsenic, As, (Greek <i>arsenikon</i> yellow orpiment), arsenic trisulfide, As, metalloid, arsenic mineral, natural arsenic.<br>
 Arsenic and arsenic compounds are Not permitted in schools.<br>
 Arsenic is Toxic if ingested.<br>
 A 65 mg dose or repeated smaller doses may be poisonous.<br>
 Also, small quantities of arsenic may be carcinogenic.<br>
High levels of arsenic have been reported in rice grains, particularly unpolished rice.<br>
Maximum intake of arsenic occurs when the cook only just covers uncooked rice in the pot with water, to be absobed by rice during cooking.<br>
So use 5 X the volume of uncooked rice for cooking water and discard the excess water when cooking is finished.<br>
In timber treatments, wood preservatives, pesticides, found free and in combined many minerals, three allotropes are yellow, black and main allotrope grey arsenic sublimes at 613<sup>o</sup>C, and n-type dopant of silicon semiconductors, hardens lead alloys.<br>
White arsenic, arsenic (III) oxide, As4O6, common in sulfide ore deposits, very toxic, rodenticide.<br>
Salvarsan, Erlich's "compound 606" (arsphenamine), was the first drug to treat syphilis.<br>
The most toxic form of arsenic is As<sup>3+</sup>, which reacts with enzymes in the body.<br>
Agricultural use of arsenic kills plants before concentration is toxic enough for humans.<br>
The proliferation of shallow tube wells in Bangladesh has caused widespread arsenic poisoning.<br>
Atomic number, 33, Relative atomic mass, 74.9216, r.d. 5.72, m.p. = 814<sup>o</sup>C, b.p. = 613<sup>o</sup>C (sublimes)<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.2.2.3H">12.2.2.3</a> Wood treated with copper chrome arsenate, (CCA)<br>
 Copper chrome arsenate is highly toxic, but the amount of arsenic in treated wood, timber, is not thought to be toxic, because a person would have to ingest about 20 cm<sup>3</sup> of treated timber to be 
 at risk from arsenic poisoning.<br>
 However, when CCA-treated wood is burnt it forms arsenic vapour so it should not be burnt, but disposed of in a landfill.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.5.9H">12.5.9</a> Chromium ions in solution, hexaaquachromium ion, Cr(H2O)6<sup>3+</sup><br>
The simplest ion is the hexaaquachromium (III) ion, Cr(H2O)6<sup>3+</sup>, usually shown as Cr<sup>3+</sup>, a complex ion with a violet-blue colour, but, when produced in a chemical reaction, is often green.<br>
 1. The hexaaquachromium (III) ion forms "violet-blue-grey" pH 3 solutions in water when the water molecule pulls a hydrogen ion off the complex ion.<br>
 So the complex ion is acting as an acid, because it gives an hydrogen ion to a water molecule.<br>
 Cr(H2O)6<sup>3+</sup> + H2O --> Cr(H2O)5(OH)<sup>2+</sup> + H3O<sup>+</sup>, but usually shown simply as:<br>
 Cr(H2O)6<sup>3+</sup> + H2O --> Cr(H2O)5(OH)<sup>2+</sup> + H<sup>+</sup> (aq).<br>
 2. Heat chromium (III) sulfate solution.<br>

 Cr(H2O)6<sup>3+</sup> + heat --> Cr(H2O)5(SO4)<sup>4+</sup>.<br>
 One of the water molecules in the complex ion is replaced by a sulfate ion.<br>
 Two positive charges are replaced by two negative charges of the sulfate ion.<br>
3. Heat chromium (III) chloride solution.<br>
 The violet-blue chromium (III) chloride solution turns green.<br>
 Cr(H2O)6<sup>3+</sup> + heat --> Cr(H2O)4Cl2<sup>+</sup> green, tetraaquadichlorochromium (III) ion,.<br>

4. Chromium ion + sodium hydroxide.<br>
 The violet-blue chromium ion solution forms a gelatinous light blue precipitate, with excess sodium hydroxide redissolves to form a green solution.<br>
 Cr(H2O)6<sup>3+</sup> + 3OH<sup>-</sup> sodium hydroxide solution --> 3H2O + Cr(H2O)3(OH)3 (s).<br>
 A hydrogen is removed from three of the water molecules in the complex ion to form a neutral complex precipitate and water.<br>
 Cr(H2O)3(OH)3 (s) + 3OH<sup>-</sup> excess sodium hydroxide solution -->[Cr(OH)6<sup>3-</sup> + 3H2O.<br>
 The precipitate dissolves again to form a solution of green hexahydroxychromate (II) ions.<br>
 Cr(OH)6]sup>3-</sup> + H2O2 solution + heat --> CrO4<sup>2-</sup>.<br>
 5. Chromium ion + sodium hydroxide + hydrogen peroxide.<br>
 The green hexahydroxychromate (II) ions formed by adding excess sodium hydroxide to chromium ion solution are oxidized by heating with hydrogen peroxide solution to form a bright yellow solution of
chromate (V) ions, i.e. a change from chromium (III) to chromium (VI).<br>
 6. Chromium ion + ammonia solution.<br>
 The violet-blue hexaaquachromium (III) ion solution forms a light blue precipitate.<br>
 However, with excess ammonia, most of the precipitate dissolves to form a red-blue solution.<br>
 Cr(H2O)6<sup>3+</sup> + 3NH3 dilute ammonia solution, acting as a base --> Cr(H2O)3(OH)3 + 3NH4<sup>+</sup>.<br>
 A hydrogen removed from three of the water molecules in the complexion to form a neutral complex precipitate and ammonium ion.<br>
 Cr(H2O)6<sup>3+</sup> + 4NH3 excess concentrated ammonia solution, then left to stand --> Cr(NH3)6<sup>3+</sup> + 6H2O.<br>
 Ammonia replaces water as a ligand in the complex ion to form hexaamminechromium (III) ions.<br>
 This reaction is a ligand and exchange reaction.<br>
 7. Chromium ion + carbonate ion.<br>
 2Cr(H2O)6<sup>3+</sup> + 3CO3<sup>2-</sup> (aq) --> 2Cr(H2O)3(OH)3 + 3CO2 bubbles + 3H2O.<br>
 A hydrogen is removed from three of the water molecules in the complex ion to form a neutral complex precipitate, and carbon dioxide and water.<br>

 Silicon is a metalloid, because it has physical properties of metals and chemical properties of non-metals.<br>
 Silicon is a semiconductor.<br>
 Silicon does not exist free in nature, but occurs mainly as silicon (IV) oxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>), in silica sand, sandstone, clay, quartz and opal.<br>
 Silicates occur in most rocks and glass.<br>
 Portland cement is a mixture of calcium and aluminium silicates.<br>
 In the silicone oils and greases, the silicon atoms form polymers containing a chain of silicon and oxygen atoms with carbon and hydrogen atoms attached to the chain.<br>
 Silicones repel water.<br>
 Silica glass, an amorphous solid, is more like a "super cooled liquid" than a crystal, because , unlike crystalline substances, it does not have a sharp melting point.<br>
 However, some chemists say that glass is a disordered solid not a supercooled liquid.<br>
Main types of glass:<br>
1. <a name="SodalimeglassH">Soda-lime glass</a><br>
 Round glass jars may contain: SiO<sub>2</sub>, CaO, K<sub>2</sub>O, MgO, TiO<sub>2</sub><br>
 Flat window glass may contain: SiO<sub>2</sub>, CaO, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, TiO<sub>2</sub><br>
 2. Borosilicate glass, Pyrex<br>
 3. Fused quartz glass may contain: SiO<sub>2</sub>, used in some camera lenses.<br>
Experiments<br>
<a name="WaterglassH">Waterglass</a><br>
 1. Sodium carbonate is heated with sand to produce sodium silicate, the water-soluble waterglass used is an inorganic builder in detergents, for preserving eggs and for fireproofing materials.<br>
 Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>(s) + SiO<sub>2</sub> (s) --&gt; Na<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub>(g).<br>
 sodium carbonate + silicon dioxide --&gt; sodium silicate (waterglass), + carbon dioxide<br>
 2. When sodium oxide Na<sub>2</sub>O 15%, silicon dioxide SiO<sub>2</sub> 70%, and calcium oxide CaO 10% and other oxides are heated together with 
 temperatures up to 1000<sup>o</sup>C, insoluble silica glass forms in which all the crystalline order of the added minerals has been lost.<br>
 In silica glass (soda lime silica glass, crown glass), each silicon atom is surrounded by four oxygen atoms as a tetrahedron and each of these is linked to other tetrahedra.<br>
 When ionic oxides are added in the glass making melt they get between the Si-O-Si bridges and weaken it, as shown in the transition glass temperatures: silica glass Tg = about 1200<sup>o</sup>C, Pyrex Tg = 550<sup>o</sup>C, window glass Tg = 550<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 3. The glass in high quality wine glasses (lead crystal), contains lead, which gives the glass a ringing sound, higher refractive index and more brilliance.<br>
 Cobalt gives blue glass, chromium gives green glass, and copper gives red or blue-green glass.<br>
 Boron oxide, B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, gives shockproof borosilicate glass, "Pyrex", that is resistant to all chemicals except hydrofluoric acid, HF.<br>
 Flint glass, lead glass, has no colour unlike crown glass that has a slight green to yellow colour due to iron impurity.<br>
 4. The 2 distinct constituents of glass are as follows:<br>
 4.1 The network former, i.e. the non-metal as an oxide is usually silicon, but it can be boron, aluminium, or phosphorus.<br>
 4.2 The network modifiers, e.g. sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium.<br>
 Glass may crystallize over a period of many years and then become more brittle, but some glass has remained uncrystallized for 4000 years in Egypt.<br>
 Sodium sesquicarbonate Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>.NaHCO<sub>3</sub>.H<sub>2</sub>O occurs as a mineral.<br>
 4.3 A famous urban legend has the opinion that glass in panes of old cathedrals and even early American buildings is thicker at the bottom, because the glass has "flowed" down over along periods.<br>
 The most likely explanation is that at a time when the thickness of panes of glass varied at that stage of technology, glaziers always inserted the thicker sides down.<br>
 5. Collect drinking glasses, including wine glasses, of roughly the same size.<br>
 Strike each glass and listen to the ring to identify the existence of modifiers in the glass.<br>

 Stoppers of glass reagent bottles containing it may stick and the bottles may explode, so use very small containers.<br>
 It reacts vigorously with sodium and other reactive metals.<br>
 Silicon tetrachloride reacts vigorously with water to form insoluble silicon dioxide and an acidic hydrogen chloride solution that gives off fumes of hydrogen chloride 
and dissociates to form hydrochloric acid solution.<br>

 Silly putty, silicone, bouncing putty (Dow Corning 3179 dilatant compound), "Tricky Putty", (toy product)<br>
Super ball, (toy product)<br>
 Slime balls, "Silly putty", silicone polymer to amuse children<br>
 The silicone polymer in silly putty, polyborosiloxane, have covalent bonds within the molecules, but hydrogen bonds between the molecules.<br>
 The hydrogen bonds are easily broken.<br>
 A silicone is chains of (OH-Si-O-Si-O-Si-OH), with two methyl groups, CH<sub>3</sub> on each of the Si atoms.<br>
 However, in "Silly putty", boron atoms that can cross link weakly with oxygen atoms in other chains replace some of the silicon atoms.<br>
 Experiments<br>
 1. Apply small amounts of stress are slowly to the putty only a few bonds are broken and the putty "flows" and stretches a great distance.<br>
 Apply larger amounts of stress quickly, many hydrogen bonds are broken, and the putty breaks or tears.<br>
 Roll it into a ball that you can bounce.<br>
 Press it onto a pencil drawing so that it lifts off the pencil marks so you can see the drawing on the surface of the silly putty.<br>
 2. Mix 55% Elmer's glue solution and 16% sodium borate in a 4: 1 ratio.<br>
 Ingredients: 65% dimethyl siloxane, hydroxy terminated polymers with boric acid, 17% silica, quartz crystalline, 9% thixotrol ST, 4% polydimethylsiloxane, 1% decamethyl cyclopentasiloxane, 1% glycerine, 1% titanium dioxide.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.19.5.0H">12.19.5.0</a> CFCs, chlorofluorocarbons, "Freons"<br>
 Compounds of fluorine or fluorine and chlorine with ethane or methane are called freons.<br>
 Freons were widely used for refrigerating fluids, aerosols and fire extinguishers.<br>
 However, scientists believe that chemicals like freons combine with the ozone (O3) that forms a layer of the atmosphere between the heights of 15 to 30 km.<br>
 A depleted ozone layer allows more high energy radiation from the sun to reach the earth and damage living cells.<br>
 The Montreal Protocol of November 1992 recommended the stopping of manufacture and consumption of CFCs, including the 
 following:<br>
 * Freon 11 CCl3F, trichlorofluoromethane).<br>
 * Tetrachloromethane, (carbon tetrachloride, CCl4, perchloromethane, dry cleaning fluid).<br>
 * 1,1,1-trichloroethane, ( C2H3Cl3, methyl chloroform, electrical equipment cleaner).<br>
 * 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, (C2H2Cl4, refrigerant and solvent no longer used in USA).<br>
 Freon is a registered trademark for non-toxic non-flammable gases invented to avoid danger from leaking refrigerator gases.<br>
 It is a name for compounds of ethane or methane with hydrogen atoms substituted by fluorine or chlorine, i.e. CFCs.<br>
 The manufacture of Freons is being discontinued, because of their ozone-depleting properties.<br>
 The term "Freon" is not in favour nowadays.<br>
 Examples of Freons include the following:.<br>
 * Freon 11, CCl3F, .trichlorofluoromethane CFC-11.<br>
 * Freon 12, CCl2F2, dichlorodifluoromethane, CFC-12, b.p. -30<sup>o</sup>C (most common refrigerant gas, solvent, used in fire extinguishers).<br>
 * Freon 21, CHCl2F, dichlorofluoromethane.<br>
 * Freon 114, CClF2CClF2, dichlorotetrafluoroethane.<br>
 * Freon 142, CH2CClF2, 1-dichloro1:1difluoroethane.<br>
 HCCl3 + 2HF --> HCF2Cl + 2HCl<br>
 chloroform + hydrogen fluoride --> chlorodifluoromethane + hydrogen chloride.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Modern aerosols are labelled: "NO CFC OZONE FRIENDLY".<br>
 Modern refrigerators are labelled: "CFC DEPLETED" or, better still, "NO CFC".<br>
 Two fluorocarbons used as refrigerants (Freons) were also used as aerosol propellants.<br>
 They are non-flammable, odourless, non-toxic at low concentrations, and chemically inert:.<br>
 (1.) CFC-11, CCl3F, was used for spraying hair and the body.<br>
 (2.) CFC-12, CCl2F2 was used in high pressure sprays for insecticides and paints.<br>
 They were also used to replace pentane in the production of the foam plastics polyurethane and polystyrene, CFC-13 CCl2FCClF2) was used in the electronics and dry cleaning industries.<br>
 In the upper atmosphere, UV radiation breaks up CFCs to produce chlorine atoms, which can combine with ozone, O3, to form ClO and an oxygen molecule, O2.<br>
 Then ClO and an oxygen atom, O, combine to produce another O2 and a free chlorine atom, Cl, again.<br>
 The initial ozone is lost, and the free chlorine atom can repeat the process.<br>
 The chlorine atom may react with methane to form hydrogen chloride, and contribute to acid rain.<br>
 Cl + O3 --> ClO + O2<br>
 ClO + O --> O2 + Cl<br>
