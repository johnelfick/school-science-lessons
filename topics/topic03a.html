<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.9.1H">3.9.1</a> Autoignition temperature, Mg<br>
 Autoignition temperature is the lowest temperature at which a material spontaneously ignites in a normal atmosphere without an external source of ignition.<br>
 A hydrocarbon vapour released at autoignition temperature will spontaneously combust without need of a flame as an ignition source.<br>
 The autoignition temperature of magnesium is 745.93 K, (472.78 C)<br>
 Heat onnly 10 to 15 cm of magnesium ribbon in a crucible to study the change in weight.<br>
2Mg + O2 --> 2MgO
 Magnesium in powder form should NOT be heated.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.5.1H">3.5.1</a> Fire safety and fire equipment<br>
 All participants in any science activity must know the location and mode of operation of fire extinguishers, fire blankets and sand buckets.<br>
 Check fire extinguishers regularly to make sure they are in working condition.<br>
 Check them for leakage, tampering and expiration of "use by" dates.<br>
 Store fire extinguishers on the floor near the front door of the laboratory.<br>
 Keep a fire blanket near the fire extinguishers.<br>
 During a science class, a school laboratory should have two unlocked doors.<br>
 Be alert to any possible sources of ignition.<br>
 Completely extinguish matches after use and put them in a non-flammable container, not a waste receptacle.<br>
 Use friction or piezoelectric lighters instead of matches.<br>
 Allow apparatus used during heating to cool before storage.<br>
 Do not place hot objects directly on bench tops, paper or other flammable substances, but use a cool gauze mat.<br>
 Do not leave hot plates, radiators and any sources of high heat unattended or left turned on overnight.<br>
 Do not leave sodium and phosphorus exposed to the air.<br>
 During experiments, keep away all paper, hair and flammable clothing.<br>
 All personnel involved in science activities must know the position of:<br>
 the gas isolating valve for the room, and<br> 
 the isolating valve at the bottled gas cylinders or gas meter.<br>
 Students must not tamper with any gas fittings.<br>
 Dry chemical fire extinguishers can be used on all types of fires, but follow the manufacturer's instructions on the device.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.5.2H">3.5.2</a> Action in case of fire - evacuation<br>
 If a fire should break out in an area for the teaching of science, the students must be moved from the source of the fire and evacuated, if necessary.<br>
 A whole school evacuation may be necessary.<br>
 Observe the school's evacuation procedures, including contact with the fire brigade.<br>
 The school's procedures must have additional instructions for everyone in workshop areas, including science areas.<br>
 Besides the school fire drill, science classes should practice a special fire drill for the laboratory.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.5.3H">3.5.3</a> Action in case of fire - equipment<br>
 1. All participants in any science activity must know the location and mode of operation of fire extinguishers, fire blankets and sand buckets.<br>
 2. Check fire extinguishers regularly to make sure they are in working condition.<br>
 Check them for leakage, tampering and expiration of "use by" dates.<br>
 Check that students have not tampered with gas fittings.<br>
 3. Store fire extinguishers on the floor near the front door of the laboratory.<br>
 Keep a fire blanket near the fire extinguishers.<br>
 Dry chemical fire extinguishers can be used on all types of fires, but follow the manufacturer's instructions on the device.<br>
 4. During a science class a school laboratory should have two unlocked doors, preferably at each end of the laboratory.<br>
 Fire blanket, Chubb, fibreglass, 1800 mm × 1200 mm<br>
 Fire extinguisher, Chubb, dry chemical powder, A: B (E), class A, B, C and E fires, paper, wood, textile, oil, liquid, and electrical fires, 2.5 kg + wall bracket.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.5.4H">3.5.4</a> Burning fat in a frying pan<br>
 Immediately turn off the source of heat and cover the frying pan with a plate, flat object or fire blanket to smother the flames, i.e. deprive the flames of oxygen gas.<br>
 Do not throw the fire blanket over a cooking fat fire, but place it over the frying pan carefully, while keeping the hands and face protected behind it.<br>
 Turn off the heat sources and leave the fire blanket in place for fifteen minutes to allow the heat to dissipate.<br>
 Do not allow water to enter the burning fat in the frying pan, even from wet hands, because the water will vaporize immediately and spread the hot burning fat.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.5.5H">3.5.5</a> Clothes on fire<br>
 If a student's clothes have caught fire, lay the student down, roll 
them over and smother the flames with the fire blanket.<br>
 For any burns, dowse the burn area with clean cold water and seek urgent medical attention.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.5.6H">3.5.6</a> Combustible solids<br>
Most combustible solids are not a fire hazard unless ground into a powder.<br>
Powders of combustible solids can be explosive when dispersed in the air.<br>
Metals in a finely divided form may ignite easily, e.g. zinc dust.<br>
The following unstable solids may decompose explosively if heated or subjected to friction:<br>
Potassium chlorate, sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate, ammonium nitrate, powdered metals and powdered sulfur.<br>
Strong oxidizing agents in contact with organic substances may lead to spontaneous ignition.<br>
The following solids can react spontaneously and exothermally with water or air:<br>
Lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, hydrides, nitrides, sulfides, acid anhydrides and concentrated acids and alkalis
Use only small quantities of these chemicals, and never keep them in small narrow-necked containers.<br>
The following solids may react with water or air giving off great heat:<br>
Lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, hydrides, nitrides, sulfides, acid anhydrides, concentrated acids and concentrated alkalis.<br>
Use only very small quantities and do not keep them in small narrow-neck containers.<br>
Spontaneous ignition may occur between strong oxidizing agents and organic chemicals, so do not store them together.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.5.7H">3.5.7</a> Electrical fires<br>
 Do not connect appliances or equipment whose current rating is greater
 than that of the power outlet.<br>
 General purpose outlets (GPOs), were usually rated at 10 amps.<br>
 Some GPOs may be rated at 15 amps.<br>
 Do not use double adapters.<br>
 Instead use portable power boards (multiple point power boards), especially those with circuit breakers.<br>
 Make sure that all power leads have no breaks in the insulation, appropriate current rating for the appliance, and are of the minimum length necessary for use.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.5.8H">3.5.8</a> Fire / burn safety<br>
 If a demonstration require the use of a Bunsen burner or boiled water, there is the risk of burns and/or fire.<br>
 1. Always use safety goggles and appropriate gloves if handling hot items or hot water.<br>
 2. If a burn occurs, treat the effected area immediately by placing burn area under cold running water for at least 15 minutes, and seek medical help.<br>
 3. Ensure an appropriate fire extinguisher is available.<br>
 4. Use heat proof mats.<br>
 5. Handle liquid nitrogen with extreme care, because of the possibility of cryogenic burns, so use personal protection, gloves and goggles.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.5.9H">3.5.9</a> Fire prevention - possible
 sources of ignition<br>
 1. Fires in school areas for the teaching of science may arise from 
chemical reactions, electrical faults, gas leakage and poor laboratory procedures.<br>
 The speed with which the fire can spread will depend on the nature of the burning substances and the materials close to the fire.<br>
 Fires of solids propagate slowly.<br>
 Fires of liquids spread less rapidly.<br>
 Gas, vapour or dust fires propagate so rapidly that they seem to explode.<br>
 Propellant gases in aerosol cans may be flammable, so avoid using aerosol cans near flames.<br>
 Fluorescent lights and electrical switches may emit sparks.<br>
 Use very small quantities of substances to be burnt in oxygen.<br>
 2. Extinguish matches completely after use and place them in a non-flammable container, not in a waste receptacle.<br>
 Use friction or piezoelectric lighters instead of matches.<br>
 3. Leave lighted Bunsen burners with the air hole closed to make the flame visible.<br>
 4. Place hot objects on a cool gauze mat or other heat proof mat, not on bench tops, paper or other flammable substances.<br>
 Allow apparatus used during heating to cool before storage.<br>
 Keep attending to hot plates, radiators and other sources of high heat.<br>
 Do not leave them switched on overnight.<br>
 5. Do not leave sodium and phosphorus exposed to the air.<br>
 6. Keep paper, hair and flammable clothing away from flames during experiments.<br>
 7. All personnel involved in science activities must know the position of the isolating valve for the room and for the bottled gas cylinders or gas meter.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.5.10H">3.5.10</a> Fireproof cloth<br>
 1. Fireproof cloth with ammonium chloride solution.<br>
 Soak cloth in the solution and let it dry.<br>
 Hold the cloth over a flame.<br>
 The cloth will only smoulder.<br>
 When the flame is removed, the burning stops.<br>
 Fabrics are often treated this way to make them fireproof.<br>
 2. Fireproof paper with alum.<br>
 Soak half a piece of paper or cloth in an alum solution, potash alum Al2(SO4)3.K2(SO4).24H2O, (KAl(SO4)2.12H2O).<br>
 Set fire to the untreated half and observe the flames when they reach the treated half.<br>
 Alum acts as a flame retardant.<br>
 It forms a buffer between a flammable substance and a source of ignition, being incombustible with its many molecules of water that it can lose at 200 oC .<br>
3. Fireproof wood with sodium silicate solution.<br>
 Hold a match by the head and dip it into a mixture of one part of sodium silicate solution and three parts of water.<br>
 Let the match dry completely.<br>
 Light the match.<br>
 The wood burns, but when the flame reaches the coating of sodium silicate, it is extinguished.<br>
4. Fireproof with sodium thiosulfate (hypo).<br>
 Soak two wooden matches in a concentrated solution of sodium thiosulfate for two hours.<br>
 Strike the matches to test whether the wood will burn.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.5.11H">3.5.11</a> Flammable gases<br>
 Flammable gases are gases having a flammable range with air at 20 oC  and a standard pressure of 101.3 kPa.<br>
 Extinguish all sources of ignition when handling flammable gases.<br>
 Turn off any Bunsen burners or, better still, use electrical hot plates.<br>
 For demonstrations of ignition tests of gases use only small quantities of gas.<br>
 The source of gas should be closed off or be far from the demonstration.<br>
 If demonstrating combustion of substances in an oxygen gas rich environment, use small quantities, because the substance may flare and burn rapidly.<br>
 Many propellant gases in pressure cans are flammable.<br>
 Do not use carbon dioxide cylinders as a source of propellant gases.<br>
 Some fluorescent lights, electrical switches and transmitting devices, (radios and mobile telephones), may be sources of ignition.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.5.12H">3.5.12</a> Flammable liquids<br>
Flammable liquids are liquids having a flash point of not more than 60 oC .<br>
Do not use any sources of ignition near flammable liquids.<br>
Low flash point substances ignite very easily and may form an explosive vapour air mixture.<br>
The following flammable liquids are allowed, if precautions are followed: ethanol, ethyl acetate, n-hexane, methylated spirit, formaldehyde solution.<br>
The following flammable liquids should not be used in school experiments: benzene, butan-1-ol, butan-2-ol, carbon disulfide, diethyl ether, cyclohexane, iso-octane, n-octane, methanol, petroleum spirit, propanol, propan-2-ol, toluene.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.5.13H">3.5.13</a> Flammable substances<br>
 1. Flammability is the tendency of a material to ignite and continue to burn.<br>
 Most polymers are flammable, because they contain carbon and hydrogen and have large heats of combustion.<br>
 In general speech, inflammable substances are likely to catch fire, they are readily ignited.<br>
 2. Degrees of flammability<br>
 2.1 Highly flammable substances have a very low boiling point, form vapours easily at room temperature and are easily ignited, e.g. petrol.<br>
 2.2 Flammable substances have a higher boiling point, form vapours less easily and require a higher temperature for ignition, e.g. diesel.<br>
 2.3 Combustible substances do not form vapours easily at room temperature and require a much higher temperature for ignition, e.g. paper.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.5.14H">3.5.14</a> Flash point<br>
 Flash point is the temperature at which a material can catch fire if exposed to an open flame or spark.<br>
 A material with a low flash point is highly flammable and a material with a high flash point is less flammable.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.5.15H">3.5.15</a> Ionization by radioactivity, smoke alarms
Conduction in air by ions
1. All ionization smoke alarms use an extremely small amount of a radioactive element in their ionization chambers.<br>
For exanmple: 37 Bq of Americium 241, in compliance with US NRC safety criteria in 10CFR 32.27.
Australia only allows the use of photoelectric smoke alarms, or recommend the use of photoelectric smoke alarms for home use.<br>
Experiment<br>
Charge an electroscope with a radioactive source.<br>
Bring various sources of ionization near parallel wires attached to a 100 V battery and a Zeleny electroscope.<br>
Increase the voltage across a plate close to a wire mesh with a radioactive source nearby and observe the current with a Zeleny electroscope.
Use an electrometer to measure the current between parallel plates as a flame is burned between them or an α-source is held nearby.<br>
In a Cerberus smoke detector combustion products decrease conductivity in a chamber with an α-source.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="HighriskH">High risk</a><br>
High risk substances with uncertain or unpredictable risk levels<br>
 A number of other chemical substances pose potentially major health and physical risks.<br>
 Departmental workplaces should consider very carefully whether the curriculum/industry relevance of experiments, demonstrations, cleaning, maintenance and/or agricultural/horticultural activities involving these substances is sufficient to warrant their being stocked.<br>
 In such cases, minimum quantities should be obtained, stored and used.<br>
 Such substances include, but are not limited to:<br>
 1. Heavy metals and the salts of heavy metals;<br>
 2. Very strong oxidizing (e.g. nitric acid, nitrates), reducing (chlorides) and toxic agents;<br>
 3. Caustic/corrosive (very strong acids, hydroxides), chemicals;<br>
 4. Extremely flammable or volatile, explosive, carcinogenic and halogenic chemicals;<br>
 5. Substances subject to hazardous decomposition;<br>
 6. Environmental toxins (e.g. agricultural chemicals); and<br>
 7. Substances and materials that may be diverted for illicit drug manufacture and security sensitive chemicals (SSANs).<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.9.8H">3.9.8</a> Scheduling<br>
Scheduling basics<br>
Scheduling is a Australian national classification system that controls how medicines and poisons are made available to the public.<br>
Medicines and poisons are classified into Schedules according to the level of regulatory control over the availability of the medicine<br>
or poison required to protect public health and safety.<br>
Schedule 1	 Not currently in use<br>
Schedule 2	 Pharmacy Medicine<br>
Schedule 3	 Pharmacist Only Medicine<br>
Schedule 4 Prescription Only Medicine OR Prescription Animal Remedy<br>
Schedule 5	 Caution<br>
Schedule 6	 Poison<br>
Schedule 7 Dangerous Poison<br>
Schedule 8 Controlled Drug<br>
Schedule 9 Prohibited Substance<br>
Schedule 10 Substances of such danger to health as to warrant prohibition of sale, supply and use<br>
The Schedules are published in the Poisons Standard and are given legal effect through state and territory legislation.<br>
The Poisons Standard is also referred to as the Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Medicines and Poisons (SUSMP).<br>
The Scheduling Handbook provides guidance on the pathway a scheduling application may follow and other details of the scheduling process.<br>
