 All participants in any science activity must know the location and mode of operation of fire extinguishers, fire blankets and sand buckets.<br>
 Check fire extinguishers regularly to make sure they are in working condition.<br>
 Check them for leakage, tampering and expiration of "use by" dates.<br>
 Store fire extinguishers on the floor near the front door of the laboratory.<br>
 Keep a fire blanket near the fire extinguishers.<br>
 During a science class, a school laboratory should have two unlocked doors.<br>
 Be alert to any possible sources of ignition.<br>
 Completely extinguish matches after use and put them in a non-flammable container, not a waste receptacle.<br>
 Use friction or piezoelectric lighters instead of matches.<br>
 Allow apparatus used during heating to cool before storage.<br>
 Do not place hot objects directly on bench tops, paper or other flammable substances, but use a cool gauze mat.<br>
 Do not leave hot plates, radiators and any sources of high heat unattended or left turned on overnight.<br>
 Do not leave sodium and phosphorus exposed to the air.<br>
 During experiments, keep away all paper, hair and flammable clothing.<br>
 All personnel involved in science activities must know the position of the gas isolating valve for the room and the isolating valve at the bottled gas cylinders or gas meter.<br>
 Students must not tamper with any gas fittings.<br>
 Dry chemical fire extinguishers can be used on all types of fires, but follow the manufacturer's instructions on the device.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.5.1H">3.5.1</a> Action in case of fire - evacuation<br>
 If a fire should break out in an area for the teaching of science, the students must be moved from the source of the fire and evacuated, if necessary.<br>
 A whole school evacuation may be necessary.<br>
 Observe the school's evacuation procedures, including contact with the fire brigade.<br>
 The school's procedures must have additional instructions for everyone in workshop areas, including science areas.<br>
 Besides the school fire drill, science classes should practice a special fire drill for the laboratory.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.5.2H">3.5.2</a> Action in case of fire - equipment<br>
 1. All participants in any science activity must know the location and mode of operation of fire extinguishers, fire blankets and sand buckets.<br>
 2. Check fire extinguishers regularly to make sure they are in working condition.<br>
 Check them for leakage, tampering and expiration of "use by" dates.<br>
 Check that students have not tampered with gas fittings.<br>
 3. Store fire extinguishers on the floor near the front door of the laboratory.<br>
 Keep a fire blanket near the fire extinguishers.<br>
 Dry chemical fire extinguishers can be used on all types of fires, but follow the manufacturer's instructions on the device.<br>
 4. During a science class a school laboratory should have two unlocked doors, preferably at each end of the laboratory.<br>
<a href="Commercial.html#Fire">Fire Safety</a>, (Commercial)<br>
 Fire blanket, Chubb, fibreglass, 1800 mm Ã— 1200 mm<br>
 Fire extinguisher, Chubb, dry chemical powder, A: B (E), suitable for fighting class A, B, C and E fires, paper, wood, textile, oil, liquid, and electrical fires, 2.5 kg with
 wall bracket.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.5.3H">3.5.3</a> Electrical fires<br>
 Do not connect appliances or equipment whose current rating is greater
 than that of the power outlet.<br>
 General purpose outlets (GPOs), were usually rated at 10 amps.<br>
 Some GPOs may be rated at 15 amps.<br>
 Do not use double adapters.<br>
 Instead use portable power boards (multiple point power boards), especially those with circuit breakers.<br>
 Make sure that all power leads are in good condition with no breaks or frays in the insulation, are of the appropriate current rating for the appliance being used, and are of the minimum length necessary for use.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.5.4H">3.5.4</a> Fire prevention - possible
 sources of ignition<br>
 1. Fires in school areas for the teaching of science may arise from 
chemical reactions, electrical faults, gas leakage and poor laboratory procedures.<br>
 The speed with which the fire can spread will depend on the nature of the burning substances and the materials close to the fire.<br>
 Fires of solids propagate slowly.<br>
 Fires of liquids spread less rapidly.<br>
 Gas, vapour or dust fires propagate so rapidly that they seem to explode.<br>
 Propellant gases in aerosol cans may be flammable, so avoid using aerosol cans near flames.<br>
 Fluorescent lights and electrical switches may emit sparks.<br>
 Use very small quantities of substances to be burnt in oxygen.<br>
 2. Extinguish matches completely after use and place them in a non-flammable container, not in a waste receptacle.<br>
 Use friction or piezoelectric lighters instead of matches.<br>
 3. Leave lighted Bunsen burners with the air hole closed to make the flame visible.<br>
 4. Place hot objects on a cool gauze mat or other heat proof mat, not on bench tops, paper or other flammable substances.<br>
 Allow apparatus used during heating to cool before storage.<br>
 Keep attending to hot plates, radiators and other sources of high heat.<br>
 Do not leave them switched on overnight.<br>
 5. Do not leave sodium and phosphorus exposed to the air.<br>
 6. Keep paper, hair and flammable clothing away from flames during experiments.<br>
 7. All personnel involved in science activities must know the position of the isolating valve for the room and the isolating valve at the bottled gas cylinders or gas meter.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.5.5H">3.5.5</a> Clothes on fire<br>
 If a student's clothes have caught fire, lay the student down, roll 
them over and smother the flames with the fire blanket.<br>
 For any burns, dowse the burn area with clean cold water and seek urgent medical attention.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.5.6H">3.5.6</a> Burning fat in a frying pan<br>
 Immediately turn off the source of heat and cover the frying pan with a plate, flat object or fire blanket to smother the flames, i.e. deprive the flames of oxygen gas.<br>
 Do not throw the fire blanket over a cooking fat fire, but place it over the frying pan carefully, while keeping the hands and face protected behind it.<br>
 Turn off the heat sources and leave the fire blanket in place for fifteen minutes to allow the heat to dissipate.<br>
 Do not allow water to enter the burning fat in the frying pan, even from wet hands, because the water will vaporize immediately and spread the hot burning fat.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.5.7H">3.5.7</a> Flammable substances<br>
 1. Flammability is the tendency of a material to ignite and continue to burn.<br>
 Most polymers are flammable, because they contain carbon and hydrogen and have large heats of combustion.<br>
 In general speech, inflammable substances are likely to catch fire, they are readily ignited.<br>
 2. Degrees of flammability<br>
 2.1 Highly flammable substances have a very low boiling point, form vapours easily at room temperature and are easily ignited, e.g. petrol.<br>
 2.2 Flammable substances have a higher boiling point, form vapours less easily and require a higher temperature for ignition, e.g. diesel.<br>
 2.3 Combustible substances do not form vapours easily at room temperature and require a much higher temperature for ignition, e.g. paper.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.5.8H">3.5.8</a> Flammable liquids<br>
Flammable liquids are liquids having a flash point of not more than 60<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
Do not use any sources of ignition near flammable liquids.<br>
Low flash point substances ignite very easily and may form an explosive vapour air mixture.<br>
The following flammable liquids are allowed, if the precautions in this document are followed: ethanol, ethyl acetate, n-hexane, methylated spirit, formaldehyde solution.<br>
The following common flammable liquids are sometimes found in a school chemistry laboratory, but should not be used in school experiments: benzene (benzol is crude benzene motor spirit), butan-1-ol, butan-2-ol, carbon disulfide CS2, diethyl ether (C2H5)2O, cyclohexane, iso-octane, n-octane, methanol, petroleum spirit, propanol, propan-2-ol, toluene.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.5.9H">3.5.9</a> Flammable gases<br>
 Flammable gases are gases having a flammable range with air at 20<sup>o</sup>C 
and a standard pressure of 101.3 kPa.<br>
 Extinguish all sources of ignition when handling flammable gases.<br>
 Turn off any Bunsen burners or, better still, use electrical hot plates.<br>
 For demonstrations of ignition tests of gases use only small quantities of gas.<br>
 The source of gas should be closed off or be far from the demonstration.<br>
 Similarly, for demonstrations of combustion of substances in an oxygen gas rich environment, use only small quantities of substance, because the substance may flare and burn rapidly.<br>
 Many propellant gases in pressure cans are flammable.<br>
 Do not use carbon dioxide cylinders as a source of propellant gases.<br>
 Some fluorescent lights, electrical switches and transmitting devices, (radios and mobile telephones), may be sources of ignition.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.5.10H">3.5.10</a> Combustible solids<br>
Most combustible solids are not a fire hazard unless ground into a powder.<br>
Powders of combustible solids can be explosive when dispersed in the air.<br>
Metals in a finely divided form may ignite easily, e.g. zinc dust.<br>
Unstable solids may decompose explosively if heated or subjected to friction, e.g. potassium chlorate, sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate, ammonium nitrate, powdered metals and powdered sulfur.<br>
Strong oxidizing agents in contact with organic substances may lead to spontaneous ignition.<br>
Solids that can react spontaneously and exothermally with water or air include lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, hydrides, nitrides, sulfides, acid anhydrides and concentrated acids and alkalis.<br>
Use only small quantities of these chemicals.<br>
Never keep them in small narrow-necked containers.<br>
Some solids may react with water or air giving off great heat, e.g. lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, hydrides, nitrides, sulfides, acid anhydrides, concentrated acids and concentrated alkalis, so use only very small quantities and do not keep them in small narrow-neck containers.<br>
Spontaneous ignition may occur between strong oxidizing agents and organic chemicals, so do not store them together.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.5.11H">3.5.11</a> Fireproof cloth<br>
 1. Fireproof cloth with ammonium chloride solution.<br>
 Soak cloth in the solution and let it dry.<br>
 Hold the cloth over a flame.<br>
 The cloth will only smoulder.<br>
 When the flame is removed, the burning stops.<br>
 Fabrics are often treated this way to make them fireproof.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">2. Fireproof paper with alum.<br>
 Soak half a piece of paper or cloth in an alum solution, potash alum Al2(SO4)3.K2(SO4).24H2O, (KAl(SO4)2.12H2O).<br>
 Set fire to the untreated half and observe the flames when they reach the treated half.<br>
 Alum acts as a flame retardant.<br>
 It forms a buffer between a flammable substance and a source of ignition, being incombustible with its many molecules of water that it can lose at 200<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">3. Fireproof wood with sodium silicate solution.<br>
 Hold a match by the head and dip it into a mixture of one part of sodium silicate solution and three parts of water.<br>
 Let the match dry completely.<br>
 Light the match.<br>
 The wood burns, but when the flame reaches the coating of sodium silicate, it is extinguished.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">4. Fireproof with sodium thiosulfate (hypo).<br>
 Soak two wooden matches in a concentrated solution of sodium thiosulfate for two hours.<br>
 Strike the matches to test whether the wood will burn.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.5.12H">3.5.12</a> Fire / burn safety<br>
 If a demonstration require the use of a Bunsen burner or boiled water, there is the risk of burns and/or fire.<br>
 1. Always use safety goggles and appropriate gloves if handling hot items or hot water.<br>
 2. If a burn occurs, treat the effected area immediately by placing burn area under cold running water for at least 15 minutes.<br>
Seek medical help.<br>
 3. Ensure an appropriate fire extinguisher is available.<br>
 4. Use heat proof mats.<br>
 5. Handle liquid nitrogen with extreme care, because of the possibility of cryogenic burns.<br>
 Personal protection, gloves and goggles, must be used.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.5.13H">3.5.13</a> Autoignition temperature<br>
 Autoignition temperature is the temperature above which enough energy is available to provide an ignition source.<br>
 A hydrocarbon vapour released to the earth's atmosphere at autoignition temperature will spontaneously combust without need of a flame as an ignition source.<br>
 Magnesium metal has a relatively low autoignition temperature of 473<sup>o</sup>C, so only small amount in ribbon form may be heated.<br>
 It should not be heated in powder form.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.5.14H">3.5.14</a> Flash point<br>
 Flash point is the lowest temperature at which a vapour ignites in air.<br>
 So it is the lowest temperature of a liquid, which still emits enough vapour to form an ignitable mixture with air.<br>
 It is the temperature at which the first ignition occurs when the temperature of a liquid exposed to the atmosphere is slowly increased with a flame exposed to the resulting vapours.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.7.1H">3.7.1</a> Bromides, hazards<br>
 Bromide ion: Br<sup>-</sup><br>
 1. The inorganic bromides produce depression, emaciation and in severe cases psychoses and mental deterioration.<br>
 Bromides were formerly used as sedatives, to control unruly children and, it is still commonly alleged that potassium bromide was added to tea to control the sexual feelings of soldiers in barracks.<br>
 2. Organic bromides are volatile liquids of relatively high toxicity.<br>
 When strongly heated, alone or with concentrated sulfuric acid, they emit highly toxic fumes.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.7.2H">3.7.2</a> Chlorates, hazards, potassium chlorate<br>
 Chlorate ion: ClO3<sup>-</sup><br>
 1. The principal toxic effect of chlorates is the destruction of the red blood cells, leading to kidney irritation.<br>
 2. Chlorates constitute a dangerous fire hazard in contact with flammable materials.<br>
 So solid chlorates should never be placed in rubbish bins.<br>
 Chlorates are powerful oxidizing agents and when contaminated with material that can be oxidized, they are particularly sensitive to friction, heat and shock.<br>
 1. When mixed with combustible material chlorates can form explosive mixtures.<br>
 The reaction with concentrated sulfuric acid can be violent.<br>
 4. Do not prepare oxygen gas with potassium chlorate and manganese dioxide as a catalyst, because this mixture may explode!<br>
 The recommended method for preparing oxygen gas is to heat 20 vols hydrogen peroxide solution.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.7.3H">3.7.3</a> Chlorides, hazards<br>
 Chloride ion: Cl<sup>-</sup><br>
 Toxicity varies widely.<br>
 When heated strongly, alone or with concentrated sulfuric acid, they can emit highly toxic fumes.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.7.4H">3.7.4</a> Chromates, dichromates, 
 hazards<br>
 Chromate ion: CrO4<sup>2-</sup>, dichromate ion Cr2O7<sup>2-</sup><br>
 These compounds have a corrosive action on skin and mucous membranes, because they are strong oxidizing agents, they could cause fire by a chemical reaction.<br>
 Hexavalent chromium compounds are known to be carcinogenic.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.7.5H">3.7.5</a> Ferricyanides, hazards<br>
 Ferricyanide ion: Fe(CN)6<sup>3-</sup><br>
 The ferricyanides as such are of low toxicity since the CN is bound.<br>
 However, when strongly heated or on contact with acids or acid fumes, highly toxic fumes are liberated.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.7.6H">3.7.6</a> Ferrocyanides, hazards<br>
 Ferrocyanide ion: Fe(CN)6<sup>4-</sup><br>
 Ferrocyanides as such are of low order of toxicity, but highly toxic decomposition products can form on mixing them with hot concentrated acids.<br>
 When strongly heated they emit highly toxic fumes.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.7.7H">3.7.7</a> Hypochlorites, hazards<br>
 Hypochlorite ion: ClO<sup>-</sup><br>
 Hypochlorites are corrosive.<br>
 When heated or on contact with acids or acid fumes they emit highly toxic fumes.<br>
 They form a moderate fire hazard by chemical reaction with reducing agents and organic matter.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.7.8H">3.7.8</a> Iodates, hazards<br>
 Iodate ion: IO3<sup>-</sup><br>
 Toxicity is variable, producing effects similar to those produced by chlorates.<br>
 Iodates are a dangerous fire hazard, because they are powerful oxidizers.<br>
 In contact with flammable or even combustible materials they can startfires.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.7.9H">3.7.9</a> Iodides, hazards, iodine allergy<br>
 Iodide ion: I<sup>-</sup><br>
 Iodides<sup></sup> are similar in toxicity to bromides.<br>
 When strongly heated they emit highly toxic fumes.<br>
 An iodine allergy is very rare and is usually confused with an allergy to shellfish or fish, a rich source of iodine.<br>
 However, only about 5% of people allergic to shellfish show symptoms of iodine allergy.<br>
 An iodine allergy could be a response to iodine medicine on the skin or iodine injected for X-ray contrast and could result in anaphylactic shock.<br>
 An injection of <a href="./appendices/appendixA.html#EpinephrineH">Epinephrine</a> may be necessary to stop the histamine reaction.<br>
 Also, people with impaired kidney function may not be able to eliminate iodine.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.7.10H">3.7.10</a> Nitrates, hazards<br>
 Nitrate ion: NO3<sup>-</sup><br>
 Large amounts taken by mouth may have serious or even fatal effects.<br>
 Most nitrates are powerful oxidizing agents and, as such, constitute a moderate fire hazard by chemical reaction.<br>
 Nitrates may explode when exposed to heat or flame or by spontaneous chemical reaction.<br>
 Ammonium nitrate has all the properties of the other nitrates, but is also able to detonate by itself.<br>
 On strong heating, nitrates emit toxic fumes.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.7.11H">3.7.11</a> Oxalates, hazards<br>
 Oxalate ion: C2O4<sup>2-</sup>, sodium oxalate: Na2C2O4<br>
 Oxalates are corrosive and produce local irritation.<br>
 When taken by mouth they have a caustic effect on the mouth, oesophagus and stomach.<br>
 The soluble oxalates are readily absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract and can cause severe damage to the kidneys.<br>
 When strongly heated they emit toxic fumes.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.7.12H">3.7.12</a> Permanganates, hazards<br>
 Permanganate: manganate(VII) ion, MnO4<sup>-</sup><br>
 Highly toxic compounds with irritant properties.<br>
 They are strong oxidizing agents and constitute a moderate fire hazard when reacting with reducing materials.<br>
 Metallic permanganate may detonate when exposed to high temperatures or shock.<br>
 The reaction with concentrated sulfuric acid can be violent.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.7.13H">3.7.13</a> Peroxides, hazards<br>
 Peroxide ion: O2<sup>2-</sup><br>
 Toxicity of these compounds is variable.<br>
 They may cause injury on contact with skin or mucous membranes.<br>
 They represent a moderate to dangerous fire hazard by chemical reaction with reducing agents and contaminants.<br>
 They are strong oxidizing agents.<br>
 Contact with water may cause violent decomposition.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.7.14H">3.7.14</a> Phosphates, hazards<br>
 Phosphate ion: PO4<sup>3-</sup><br>
 Phosphates have variable toxicity.<br>
 When strongly heated they can emit highly toxic fumes.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.7.15H">3.7.15</a> Sulfates, hazards<br>
 Sulfate ion: SO4<sup>2-</sup><br>
 Sulfates have variable toxicity.<br>
 In general, the toxic quality of substances containing the sulfate radical is that of the material with which this radical is combined.<br>
 On strong heating, emits highly toxic fumes.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.7.16H">3.7.16</a> Sulfides, hazards<br>
 Sulfide ion: S<sup>2-</sup><br>
 Sulfides have variable toxicity.<br>
 The sulfides of potassium, calcium, ammonium and sodium are similar in action to the alkalis.<br>
 They cause softening and irritation of the skin.<br>
 If taken by mouth they are corrosive.<br>
 Sulfides of the heavy metals are generally insoluble and hence have 
little toxic action except through the liberation of hydrogen sulfide.<br>
 They constitute a moderate fire hazard when exposed to flame or by spontaneous chemical reaction.<br>
 Many sulfides ignite easily in air at room temperature.<br>
 Others require a higher temperature or the presence of an oxidizer.<br>
 Many powerful oxidizers on contact with sulfides ignite violently.<br>

Scheduling basics<br>
Scheduling is a Australian national classification system that controls how medicines and poisons are made available to the public.<br>
Medicines and poisons are classified into Schedules according to the level of regulatory control over the availability of the medicine<br>
or poison required to protect public health and safety.<br>
Schedule 1	 Not currently in use<br>
Schedule 2	 Pharmacy Medicine<br>
Schedule 3	 Pharmacist Only Medicine<br>
Schedule 4 Prescription Only Medicine OR Prescription Animal Remedy<br>
Schedule 5	 Caution<br>
Schedule 6	 Poison<br>
Schedule 7 Dangerous Poison<br>
Schedule 8 Controlled Drug<br>
Schedule 9 Prohibited Substance<br>
Schedule 10 Substances of such danger to health as to warrant prohibition of sale, supply and use<br>
The Schedules are published in the Poisons Standard and are given legal effect through state and territory legislation.<br>
The Poisons Standard is also referred to as the Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Medicines and Poisons (SUSMP).<br>
The Scheduling Handbook provides guidance on the pathway a scheduling application may follow and other details of the scheduling process.<br>
