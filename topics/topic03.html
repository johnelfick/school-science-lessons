 Teachers should select school science lessons and laboratory experiences that are appropriate to the student group and the level of learning.<br>
 When selecting laboratory experiences the teacher must check that school authorities approve the activity.<br>
 This document contains suggestions for practical teaching by a trained science teacher.<br>
 After choosing an experiment, the teacher should practise it in the preparation room before demonstrating it to students or before requiring students to do it.<br>
 The teacher has the duty of making the decision about whether the experiment is safe for the children in the classroom or laboratory.<br>
 The level of risk of injury to students and teacher will vary from school to school, depending on:<br>
 1. expertise of the teacher,<br>
 2. size of the student group,<br>
 3. diversity of students, and<br>
 4. the facilities and equipment.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.1.1H">3.1.1</a> Workplace Health and Safety Act, 1995, Department of Education, State of Queensland, Australia<br>
The Department of Education is committed to providing and maintaining a healthy and safe work and earning environment for all employees, students and others.<br>
The Department has a statutory responsibility under the Workplace Health and Safety Act (2005), to ensure the risk of disease or injury from the school or workplace is minimized for all persons in contact with the school or other departmental workplace.<br>
Principals, teachers, and all other employees and persons at the school have an obligation for ensuring workplace health and safety at the school.<br>
In particular, the Workplace Health and Safety Act 1995 places a statutory obligation on employees and other persons at the school to follow instructions for workplace health and safety, use personal protective equipment and behave responsibly in regard to workplace health and safety while at school or involved in school activities.<br>
 Obligations for workplace health and safety should be ensured by:<br>
 1. identifying hazards,<br>
 2. assessing risks that may result, because of the hazards,<br>
 3. deciding on control measures to prevent, or minimize the level of, the risks,<br>
 4. implementing control measures, and<br>
 5. monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the measures.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.1.2H">3.1.2</a> Risk assessment<br>
See: <a href="./commercial/Comlist.html#Safety">Risk assessment</a>, (Commercial).<br>
 Once a hazard has been identified, the consequences associated with it need to be determined.<br>
 In schools, the most likely effects to consider would be those that involve direct injury, e.g. cuts, burns, electrocution and poisoning.<br>
 Less likely effects might also include those arising from longer term exposure, e.g. exposure to materials containing asbestos.<br>
Risk assessments may vary in complexity depending on the nature and location of the hazardous situation, the personnel and equipment available, and the age and number of students present.<br>
The underlying principle of all risk assessments is the consideration of consequences of the hazardous outcome and the probability or frequency of the occurrence.<br>
 In general, when a learning / teaching activity occurs in the teaching of science, the risk is related to the probability of an injury or illness occurring, the duration and frequency of exposure to the hazard, and the consequence or outcome of something going wrong.<br>
 The two major types of risk assessment:<br>
 1. The potential effects of hazards that are immediate or acute.<br>
 These include hazards that are mechanical, electrical, penetrating injuries and some forms of manual handling.<br>
 2. The potential effects of hazards that are chronic or long-term hazards.<br>
 These include hazards that involve noise, hazardous substances / chemicals, repetitive movements and constrained postures.<br>
 Teachers of science should refer to the relevant risk assessment details in HS-10: Workplace Health and Safety.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.1.3H">3.1.3</a> Teacher responsibility<br>
 In accordance with the Department of Education Manual module HS-07: Occupational Health and Safety, teachers are responsible for the health and safety of students while on school premises and participating in official school activities, wherever these may take place.<br>
 Teachers should take care to ensure that appropriate use is made of all safeguards, safety devices, personal protective equipment and other appliances provided 
for health and safety,<br>
 (a) maintain healthy and safe procedures and practices,<br>
 (b) collaborate with Regional Occupational Health and Safety Consultants, employees of Education Queensland, workplace health and safety representatives or workplace health and safety committees to assess hazards, which exist in the school or workplace, and to eliminate or reduce the associated risks as required,<br>
 (c) identify hazards and minimize risks in science teaching areas,<br>
 (d) ensure that employees, students and other users of educational facilities receive appropriate workplace health and safety information and training (see your School Health and Safety Officer or Principal),<br>
 (f) manage behaviour of students (including school ground and excursion activities),<br>
 (g) ensure all work injuries, work related illnesses and dangerous occurrences at the workplace are recorded.<br>
 Such records are to be completed and dispatched to the appropriate authorities within the designated period (see your Principal or Registrar),<br>
 (h) ensure special needs groups, e.g. people with disabilities and persons from non-English speaking backgrounds, are considered in regard to workplace health and safety issues.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.1.4H">3.1.4</a> Hazard classification and experiments<br>
 1. The experiments in this document do not require the use of any chemicals with the following hazard classifications:<br>
 Explosive, Oxidizing, Toxic, Radioactive, Highly flammable or Extremely flammable (flash point 21<sup>o</sup>C), or any chemical specified in the Schedule 1 of the Poison Rules, UK.<br>
 However, some experiments requiring the use of propanone, acetone, as a solvent are included.<br>
 2. Preparations of small amounts of some dangerous gases are included on the assumption that only experienced science teachers do the experiment and direct observation of these gases has educational value.<br>
 These experiments contain the warning: "BE CAREFUL!".<br>
 This experiment must be done in a fume cupboard.<br>
 3. Another criterion for including some limited handling of dangerous substances by experienced teachers is that students may experience these substances in their daily lives.<br>
 Propanone (acetone), was used for nail polish remover, but is being phased out in the modern cosmetic industry.<br>
 Chlorine compounds are used for bleaches and water disinfectants.<br>
 Sulfuric acid is used in a motor car battery.<br>
 4. The warning "Be careful" is used in this document where experiments or procedures require special care.<br>
 However, the experiments described have been selected on the basis that a trained science teacher practises them before deciding whether to include them in the teaching programme.<br>
 The trained science teacher who has the duty of care must decide which students are allowed to do the experiments themselves and under what conditions.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.1.5H">3.1.5</a> Laboratory organization<br>
 1. Equipment and chemicals are stored in a systematic, orderly and a neat manner.<br>
 2. Equipment and chemicals borrowed from a preparation room or storage area is returned to the assigned place.<br>
 3. Teaching and storage rooms are uncluttered with no equipment protruding over benches, no dangling wires and no equipment stored on the floor.<br>
 4. Bench tops are always clean.<br>
 Any spillage is wiped up immediately.<br>
 5. Reagent bottles are clearly labelled and filled regularly.<br>
 Reagent solutions and solids must be constantly checked and replaced where necessary from stock bottles.<br>
 The reagent bottles should be labelled with the name of the substance and the concentration of the solution.<br>
 Unused reagents should never be returned to the stock bottles.<br>
 6. Sinks are clean and not blocked with waste.<br>
 7. Separate waste bins are used for broken glass (which must be wrapped), for paper, for cloth and for solid chemical residues.<br>
 8. Water outlets, gas turrets on the benches, power outlets and electrical switches are in good working order.<br>
 9. The laboratory and storeroom doors are locked when not occupied.<br>
 10. Keep the laboratory safe and sealed! Before leaving the laboratory for the day:<br>
 1. Close the windows,<br>
 2. Lock away all the equipment,<br>
 3. Turn off lights, equipment and computers,<br>
 4. Lock all doors.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.2.1H">3.2.1</a> Supervision of students<br>
 Supervision of students must be continuous and vigilant so that unauthorized or inappropriate behaviour does not lead to accidents resulting in physical injury, fires or other dangers.<br>
 Teachers must choose a set of laboratory rules to be prominently displayed and with copies given to students.<br>
 Students must know the rule and understand them.<br>
 Teachers must pay particular attention to the following rules:<br>
 1. Students do not enter any laboratory or storeroom unless a teacher is present.<br>
 2. Students do not eat or drink in the laboratory or storeroom.<br>
 3. Students do not taste chemicals.<br>
 4. Students must behave in a careful and businesslike manner.<br>
 5. Students are safely seated and not crowded, with fellow students, chemicals and glassware not within "elbow width".<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.2.2H">3.2.2</a> Protective clothing and equipment<br>
See: <a href="./commercial/Comlist.html#Safety">Clothing</a>, (Commercial).<br>
See: <a href="Stequ1.html#List1DH">List 1D</a> Protective clothing and equipment<br>
1. Students in chemistry classes should wear strong shoes and take care of unbuttoned long sleeves and long hair.<br>
 Students must wear protective clothing, e.g. aprons, safety glasses and nitrile chemical-resistant gloves when chemicals are being handled.<br>
Teachers should be aware of students who wear contact lenses.<br>
2. Safety spectacles, | safety goggles<br>
Students should wear safety spectacles or safety goggles if the experiment could propel chemicals into the eyes.<br>
Students wearing prescription glasses should change to use safety glasses.<br>
There is always the danger of hot or caustic materials being splashed into the eyes.<br>
3. Safety gloves<br>
See: <a href="./commercial/Comlist.html#Safety">Gloves</a> (Commercial).<br>
Many schools require students to wear heavy gloves, safety spectacles or safety goggles, and closed shoes for all experiments.<br>
The four kinds of gloves are as follows:<br>
3.1 Disposable surgical gloves, which are used during dissections, handling animal tissue and blood products, but not for chemicals,<br>
3.2 Rubber washing-up gloves, which are not designed to protect against concentrated chemicals or organic solvents, e.g. acetone,<br>
3.3 Nitrile chemical-resistant gloves, which are designed for handling concentrated acids and organic solvents,<br>
3.4 Insulated heat-proof gloves.<br>
Safety gloves<br>
Students must use safety glasses and nitrile chemical-resistant gloves if the school allows them to dilute concentrated acids or bases and when heating chemicals to avoid the danger of hot or caustic materials being splashed into the eyes.<br>
Students must wear insulated heat-proof gloves and aprons if the activity could result in damage to their hands or body.<br>
Pay attention to unconfined long hair, jewellery, ties, unbuttoned long sleeves and loose clothing.<br>
Synthetic garments that may be a fire hazard.<br>
Students in chemistry classes should wear strong shoes that completely cover the feet and protect them from spilt corrosive or hot liquids.<br>
Students may NOT wear sandals.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.2.3H">3.2.3</a> Experimental procedures<br>
1. Read the label on reagent bottles twice to avoid errors.<br>
2. Always follow exactly the instructions for chemical experiments.<br>
3. Do not substitute another chemical for chemicals specified in the experiment instructions.<br>
4. Always add a solid to a liquid reagent to achieve better control of gases that form in the reaction.<br>
5. Do not let students do unauthorized experiments.<br>
Some chemicals are safe by themselves, but they may form explosive mixtures when mixed with oxidizing agents, e.g. sulfur, sucrose, (cane sugar), and powdered zinc.<br>
6. This document does not recommend the use of gas generators, e.g. Kipp's apparatus.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.2.4H">3.2.4</a> Teach manipulative skills<br>
 Teachers should teach the necessary manipulative skills by demonstration before asking students to use the skills in an experiment.<br>
 These skills include heating of liquids or solids in test-tubes, heating large volumes of liquids, handling glassware containing hot liquids, carrying glassware, handling of reagent bottles.<br>
 Diluting concentrated acids and inserting glass tubing or thermometers in rubber stoppers should be done by the teacher in the preparation room before the experiment.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.3.01H">3.3.01</a> Storing chemicals - general rules<br>
 1. Check reagent solutions and solids regularly and replace used chemicals from stocks or stock bottles.<br>
 Label reagent bottles with the name of the substance and the concentration of the solution.<br>
 Never return unused reagents to the stock bottles.<br>
 2. Store flammable liquids at eye level in a well-ventilated area away from heat sources.<br>
 3. Store formalin (solution of formaldehyde (methanal), in water), in glass bottles away from hydrochloric acid.<br>
 4. Store organic chemicals inside self-sealing plastic bags.<br>
 5. Store strong oxidants and oxidizing agents away from flammable organic chemicals.<br>
 Powerful oxidizing agents, e.g. chlorates, peroxides, perchlorates, and perchloric acid, are not usually found in a school science laboratory.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.3.1H">3.3.1</a> Storing acids, acetic acid<br>
 Store concentrated acids in plastic boxes on the floor.<br>
 Store acetic acid (ethanoic acid), away from other acids, preferably in another room.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.3.2H">3.3.2</a> Storing alkalis, ammonia solution<br>
 Store alkalis at floor level standing in a strong plastic tray large enough to contain the volume of the container if breakage or spill occurs.<br>
 Store concentrated alkalis away from concentrated acids and apart from metals.<br>
 Store ammonia solution (10% ammonia solution), as with acids, but separate from them, not near oxidizing agents.<br>
 Ammonia solution produces dangerous irritating ammonia fumes.<br>
 Carefully unstopper bottles of ammonia solution in a fume cupboard to prevent damage to the eyes from the fumes.<br>
 Dilute ammonia solution by adding ammonia solution to water in a fume cupboard.<br>
 Store concentrated sodium hydroxide in plastic boxes on the floor, but away from the acids.<br>
 Do not use glass stoppers.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.3.3H">3.3.3</a> Storing chromium (VI) oxide<br>
 Chromium (VI) oxide may cause fire on contact with combustible materials and contact with skin may cause severe burns.<br>
 Spread soda ash over spillage of chromium (VI) oxide, and use plenty of water.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.3.4H">3.3.4</a> Storing flammable liquids<br>
 Store flammable liquids at eye level in a well-ventilated area away from heat sources.<br>
 Flammable liquids may include methylated spirit, nail polish remover, (acetone), cleaning products, paints and glues.<br>
 Store strong oxidants away from flammable organic chemicals.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.3.5H">3.3.5</a> Storing hygroscopic and deliquescent substances<br>
<b>Be careful!</b> Hygroscopic and deliquescent substances may absorb moisture from human tissue and so should be treated as potentially highly corrosive!<br>
 Both hygroscopic and deliquescent substances may absorb moisture from tissue so treat them as potentially highly corrosive.<br>
 Hygroscopic substances absorb water from the air, e.g. concentrated sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide, concentrated sulfuric acid, glycerine and ethanol ("absolute alcohol").<br>
 Deliquescent substances are hygroscopic substances that absorb water to such an extent that they form a concentrated solution of the substance, e.g. calcium chloride.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.3.6H">3.3.6</a> Storing organic chemicals<br>
 Store organic chemicals inside self-sealing plastic bags.<br>
 This eliminates the smell associated with such chemicals it also gives early warning of any leaking bottle.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.3.7H">3.3.7</a> Storing oxidizing agents<br>
 Store oxidizing agents in a desiccator away from other chemicals.<br>
 Powerful oxidizing agents, e.g. chlorates, peroxides, perchlorates, and perchloric acid, are not often used in a school science laboratory.<br>
 Oxidizing materials are chemicals that support combustion or burning.<br>
 If they are placed in contact with materials that act as fuels, there is danger of an explosion or fire.<br>
 Oxidizing materials include chlorates, peroxides, perchlorates, and perchloric acid.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.3.9H">3.3.9</a> Storing sodium and potassium<br>
 Sodium and potassium react violently with water, and the heat produced can ignite the hydrogen gas evolved.<br>
 Contact with skin causes thermal and caustic burns.<br>
 Cutting heavily oxidized potassium may cause an explosion, because of the combination of the dioxide with organic material.<br>

See: <a href="./commercial/Commercial3.html#ElementsC">Carbon dioxide</a> (Commercial).<br>
<a href="./images/3.3.5.jpg">See diagram: 3.3.5</a> Soda chargers<br>
Do not use carbon dioxide soda syphon bulbs in science teaching activities, e.g. demonstration of rocketry.<br>
In a recent report, 2014, a student stole a carbon dioxide cylinder from a school laboratory, threw it into a fire at home and was killed by the resulting explosion.<br>
In the nine years between 1989 and 1998, the Australian Bomb Data Centre has revealed that there were 1, 011 reports of "soda bombs" being used as explosive devices, often causing injuries 
and some deaths.<br>
Soda siphon (syphon), bulbs are small metal canisters containing roughly 10 cubic centimetres of either carbon dioxide or nitrous oxide under pressure, carbon dioxide to produce soda water and nitrous oxide to aerate cream.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.6.2H">3.6.2</a> Electrical safety rules<br>
 1. The apparatus in use has an up to date electrical safety tag (tag n test), label attached to the power lead.<br>
 2. The apparatus is connected to a Residual Current Device (Safety Switch).<br>
 Earth leakage detectors detects quite small currents to earth and turn of the supply very quickly to prevent electrocution.<br>
 3. The apparatus is only operated by the lecturer or trained personnel.<br>
 Never interfere with the mains.<br>
 Leave it to qualified persons.<br>
 4. Always carry-out a visual inspection of the apparatus before performing the demonstration.<br>
 5. Be aware of any tripping hazards due to leads on the floor.<br>
 6. Do not use electrical equipment if something has been spilled on or near the equipment.<br>
 7. Do not attempt to service any electrical apparatus unless you are qualified.<br>
 8. One is hand safer than two, because using two hands allows a current path across the chest.<br>
 The back of the hand is safer than the front of the hand, because the muscles that contract the hand are stronger than the muscles that flatten it.<br>
 9. Dry, rubber soled shoes can insulate you from the floor.<br>
 10. Even small shocks can be dangerous to a person on a metal ladder.<br>
 11. Power saws and electric mowers may cut their own cable and electrocute the user.<br>
 12. Dry skin is not a very good conductor, but people with electrodes attached to them, or metal catheters in their veins, or salty gels or bathing solution: have a low resistance pathway to their tissue and so are vulnerable.<br>
 Even static electric charges might be dangerous to them.<br>
 13. The master switches should be off before changing fuses.<br>
 14. Water is a conductor of electricity, so wet floors and baths are dangerous, because they provide a low resistance pathway from body tissues to the ground.<br>
 15. If there is an accident act quickly.<br>
 First ensure you will not be put in danger of electrical shock by attempting to help the victim.<br>
 Switch off the electrical supply before removing the casualty.<br>
 If breathing has stopped, begin artificial respiration at once, if possible by the FIRST AID officer.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.6.3H">3.6.3</a> Eye washing, safety showers<br>
 Doors in and around preparation rooms are usually locked for security reasons.<br>
 However, to enable access to safety shower and eye washing facilities, ensure that connecting doors to preparation rooms are unlocked and open at the beginning of science classes.<br>
 The first 30 seconds are critical in the treatment of chemical splashes in the eye.<br>
 The minimum recommended time for continuation of eye washing is 20 minutes.<br>
 Remove contact lenses.<br>
 For permanent eye washing fixtures, the water stream should allow continual irrigation of the eye without harmful pressure being placed on it.<br>
 You can squeeze an eyewash bottle to irrigate the eye for a short period, but a continuous supply of water may still be needed when the eyewash bottle becomes empty.<br>
 Regularly empty and refill eyewash bottles to prevent contamination by algae and micro-organisms.<br>
 Wearing safety glasses lessens the possibility of eye injury.<br>
 Check the water pressure of safety showers or the nearest tap or hose.<br>
 Where safety showers are installed, the person affected by a chemical spill should stand in the appropriate place and be thoroughly doused.<br>
 Where safety showers are not installed, use the nearest tap or hose.<br>
 Check periodically the permanent eye washing and safety shower facilities.<br>
 Also, check the water pressure of safety showers or the nearest tap or hose.<br>

 If a demonstration requires any chemicals, there may be a risk of spilling hazardous materials.<br>
 1. Ensure that you are familiar with the relevant MSDS for the chemicals used or have discussed with the lecture demonstration technician the relevant safety issues involved with any chemical used.<br>
 2. Be sure to have a chemical spill kit available with the demonstration.<br>
 Use Spill kits as instructed.<br>
 3. Be sure all chemicals are in labelled containers with a lid.<br>
 4. Do NOT pour chemicals until the moment they are required for the demonstration.<br>
 5. Be sure all unwanted chemicals are disposed of in the proper fashion.<br>
 6. Do NOT pour used chemicals down the sink.<br>
 7. Wear safety goggles where there is the possibility of eye contact.<br>
 8. Use spill trays if spillage is likely.<br>
 Follow the following general precautions:<br>
 1. Chemicals should be treated with caution.<br>
 Do not allow chemicals to come in contact with skin or clothing.<br>
 Remove contaminated clothing and bag it.<br>
 2. Spillage on the skin: Immediately wash affected area with water for several minutes.<br>
 3. For chemicals in the eyes, wash the eyes with running water for at least 10 minutes.<br>
 Inform safety officer and seek medical treatment.<br>
 4. Always report any accidents to the safety officer who may recommend seeking medical advice.<br>

Usually, the chemical name used in this document is the standard name followed by synonyms.<br>
These names were checked with names in the document "Education Queensland, (Australia), Aspects of Science management: A reference manual for Schools" 1997 and the catalogue of Philip Harris, 
UK.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.4.2H">3.4.2</a> Quantity of chemical to be used in experiments<br>
See: <a href="./commercial/Comlist.html#Chemistry">Chemistry, Chemicals</a> (Commercial).<br>
 1. In this document, "dilute solution" refers to a 2 M solution, or a 10% solution, unless otherwise specified.<br>
 2. In this document, "concentrated acid", or any other substance, refers to the concentration supplied by chemical suppliers, e.g. concentrated hydrochloric acid is 36% w / w, unless otherwise specified.<br>
 3. For all experiments, unless otherwise instructed, use either:<br>
 3.1 a 5 mL of solution, or<br>
 3.2 a test-tube filled to the depth of a finger width, or<br>
 3.3 the powder on a little finger nail, or<br>
 3.4 a piece of solid chemical the size of half a dried pea, or<br>
 3.5 no more than one third of a test-tube of any solution.<br>
 4. Do not make gas jars full of gas for demonstration purposes.<br>
 Use test-tubes with stoppers to collect gases.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.4.3H">3.4.3</a> Prepare dilute acids and bases, (Safety instructions)<br>
 1. Prepare dilute acids by slowly adding ACID TO WATER.<br>
 2. Keep concentrated mineral acids, e.g. hydrochloric sulfuric or nitric acids, in a special container on the floor of a locked cupboard.<br>
 Only the teacher or a laboratory assistant may handle concentrated acids or strong bases.<br>
 3. Wear safety glasses to protect the eyes when handling concentrated acids.<br>
 Students may handle dilute mineral acids and bases, but if they spill them on the skin or in the eyes, wash immediately with plenty of water.<br>
 4. Organic acids are not so dangerous as mineral acids, but phenol (carbolic acid), and ethanedioic acid-2-water (oxalic acid), are toxic.<br>
 5. Strong bases, e.g. sodium hydroxide (caustic soda), and potassium hydroxide (caustic potash), can cause burns.<br>
 6. Weaker bases, e.g. calcium hydroxide (limewater, slaked lime), can cause burns if they are left in contact with the skin.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.4.4H">3.4.4</a> Corrosive substances<br>
 1. Corrosive substances are those that cause severe skin damage.<br>
 How corrosive a substance is depends on the length of time taken for the damage to occur.<br>
 2. Splashes to the eyes present a far greater risk of severe injury than splashes to skin.<br>
 3. Indicators of corrosiveness<br>
 3.1 Highly corrosive substances cause visible severe skin damage at the site of contact in less than three minutes.<br>
 3.2 Corrosive substances cause visible severe skin damage at the site of contact in a period of three to sixty minutes.<br>
 3.3 Irritating substances cause visible severe skin damage at the site of contact in a period of up to four hours.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.4.5H">3.4.5</a> Skin contamination<br>
 1. The following sequence of procedures should be observed for skin contamination by substances other than phenolics:<br>
 Remove contaminated clothing and simultaneously irrigate thoroughly the affected area with water.<br>
 Continue drenching for five minutes and then wash the skin gently with a little soap and a lot of water.<br>
 Irrigate again with water and cover the affected area with gauze or lint.<br>
 2. The following sequence of procedures should be observed for skin contamination by phenolic substances:<br>
 Swab off the phenol using swabs soaked in glycerine or vegetable oil.<br>
 Discard each swab and continue with a new swab.<br>
 Care must be taken to avoid spreading the burn.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.4.6H">3.4.6</a> Gas or vapour inhalation, EAR, CPR<br>
 The following sequence of procedures should be observed for the inhalation of a poisonous substance, e.g. a gas:<br>
 1. Carry or drag the patient into fresh air.<br>
 Loosen clothing, check breathing, pulse, and pupils of the eyes.<br>
 If the patient is not breathing, pulse is absent and eyes are dilated, start Expired Air Resuscitation (EAR) / Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation, (CPR).<br>
 2. If patient is not breathing, but pulse is present, start Expired Air Resuscitation (EAR).<br>
 3. If patient is breathing, but unconscious, place patient flat on the floor, roll the patient onto the right side, remove any dentures and clean the mouth of mucus and vomitus.<br>
 Keep the patient's chin well up and forward by pushing on the angle of the jaw.<br>
 Keep the patient warm.<br>
 Do not give the unconscious patient anything by mouth.<br>
 If the patient is conscious, encourage the patient to take a series of rapid and deep breaths, then gradually bring the patient into a sitting position.<br>
 Make certain the patient does not get up and walk around.<br>
 Make the patient lie flat if he or she feels faint.<br>
 4. If the heart has stopped beating, CPR can restore blood flow and ventilation.<br>
 The compression to the rib cage over the sternum reduces the volume of the thoracic cavity, squeezes the heart and pushes blood into the aorta and pulmonary trunk.<br>
 With removal of the pressure, the thorax expands and blood moves into the main veins.<br>
 The cycles of compression must be interspersed with cycles of mouth-to-mouth breathing that maintain pulmonary ventilation.<br>
 It is difficult to practise CPR on a living person without causing injury, e.g. broken ribs.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.4.7H">3.4.7</a> Chemicals swallowed<br>
 The following sequence of procedures should be observed after ingestion of a poisonous substance.<br>
 Treatment for an unconscious patient<br>
 1. Do not give anything by mouth.<br>
 Place patient flat on back and then roll him / her onto the side.<br>
 Put your finger in the patient's mouth and remove dentures and any obstructions to breathing.<br>
 Hold the patient's jaw well up and forward.<br>
 2. Check breathing.<br>
 If not breathing, turn casualty on to back and apply E.A.R.<br>
 3. Check pulse.<br>
 If pulse absent, apply C.P.R.<br>
 Loosen clothing around neck, abdomen and chest.<br>
 4. If the patient vomits, clean out his / her mouth.<br>
 Arrange transport to hospital or doctor.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Treatment for a conscious patient<br>
 1. If the substance swallowed can be identified as a strong acid, a strong alkali or other corrosive, a phenolic substance, kerosene or a petroleum product, or is listed under the poisons first aid list (which should be displayed in an appropriate location), as a substance for which vomiting should not be induced, then do not induce vomiting, but follow the First Aid instructions.<br>
 2. Give fluids, water or milk only if indicated in the poisons first aid list for the specific poison.<br>
 Do not give more than 250 mL of any fluid, because it may induce vomiting.<br>
 3. If vomiting is to be induced, use syrup of ipecac.<br>
 Do not give milk as this increases the risks if aspirated.<br>
 If advised by a doctor, or Poisons Information Centre, or if not contradicted above, induce vomiting by the appropriate dose of syrup of ipecac: 30 mL for adult, 15 mL for children, followed by 200 mL of water.<br>
 If vomiting has not occurred in 30 minutes, the ipecac syrup may be repeated once only.<br>
 4. If in doubt about the identity of the poison, do not induce vomiting.<br>
 Keep the patient warm, comfortable and calm while waiting and being transported to a hospital.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.4.8H">3.4.8</a> Chemical vapours and smelling chemicals<br>
<a href="./images/1.13.gif">See diagram 1.13</a>: Smelling chemicals<br>
 1. Isolate chemical vapours by doing experiments in a fume cupboard or use very small quantities of chemicals near an open window with good ventilation.<br>
 2. Do not inhale gases directly from the test-tube.<br>
 Fill the lungs by breathing in deeply.<br>
 Close the mouth then fan the gas towards the nose with the hand and sniff cautiously.<br>
 If you detect no odour, move closer and try again.<br>
 When you detect the odour, breathe out through the nose again.<br>

See: <a href="./commercial/Commercial.html#Pipettes">Pipettes</a> (commercial websites).<br>
When adding chemicals to a reaction or container:<br>
 1. Students should not touch any chemical, but use a spatula or gloves, except for a few experiments when students are told to feel the texture of chemicals or minerals to determine whether they are crystalline or amorphous.<br>
 If students do touch any chemical, they should immediately wash their hands with soap and water.<br>
 2. The best way to add chemical to a container is to pour the powdered or crystalline chemical into a creased rectangle of clean paper, then tip the chemical from this paper held in a V- shape.<br>
 3. When taking chemicals from a container, after removing the stopper, keep holding the stopper in one hand so that you can replace it immediately afterwards.<br>
 This method ensures that the chemical does not have unnecessary exposure to air and that the correct stopper is replaced.<br>
 4. Transfer liquids through a funnel or pour the liquid slowly down a glass rod.<br>
 5. Fill pipettes with a pipette-filler and not by sucking by mouth.<br>

 1.0 Do not keep any chemicals that do not have labels or are not on a list of chemicals approved by the Ministry of Education.<br>
 Ask officials in the Ministry of Education chemists or chemists in a government chemistry laboratory how to dispose of these unwanted chemicals.<br>
 1.1 Avoid waste by using chemicals only in those quantities necessary for the learning experience.<br>
 1.2 Avoid using the more expensive chemicals, e.g. silver chloride.<br>
 1.2 Re-use chemicals not affected by the chemical process, e.g. metals and metal carbonates + acids usually leave residues of unaffected metal and carbonate that may be washed clean and reused.<br>
 1.3 Recycle chemicals produced by chemical processes, but only when the process of recycling is simple and not hazardous.<br>
 For example, recrystallize copper sulfate crystals from solutions by evaporation or by placing steel wool in the solution overnight, but do not recycle lead or mercury salts.<br>
 1.4 Do not burn unwanted chemicals, because they may form carcinogenic gases.<br>
 2.0 Methods of disposal may include the following:<br>
 2.1 Wash down the sink<br>
 2.1.1 Waste solutions of most chemicals used in school science experiments may be disposed of down the sink to the sewer.<br>
 In some countries the effluent must comply with specific limits for disposal of chemicals to the sewer, e.g. ammonia, limit of 40 grams / day or 29 L of 0.1 M solution / day.<br>
 2.1.2 Dilute wastes miscible with water or already in solution with a large volume of water, then neutralize with sodium carbonate or dilute hydrochloric acid, then wash down the sink, e.g. salt solutions, ethanol.<br>
 2.1.3 Treat heavy metal wastes with sodium hydroxide until pH 8-10, then wash down the sink.<br>
 2.2 Dispose with normal refuse.<br>
 2.2.1 Wrap solid wastes in paper and place in the garbage, e.g. iron filings.<br>
 2.2.2 Absorb wastes not miscible with water onto paper or vermiculite or perlite or cat litter, then seal in a plastic bag and place in the garbage.<br>

 Toxicity for substances that have been assessed by Worksafe Australia, the following scale is used to describe the level of toxicity<br>
 Harmless<br>
 Allowed ingredient in human foods, human metabolite or known to be inert in the body, i.e. sodium chloride.<br>
 Harmful<br>
 Intake of a small amount would probably not cause sickness, e.g. magnesium sulfate.<br>
 Slightly toxic<br>
 Intake of large amounts may cause sickness, i.e. copper sulfate.<br>
 Moderately toxic<br>
 Intake of a small amount may cause sickness, i.e. sodium tetraborate.<br>
 Highly toxic<br>
 Teacher must ensure effective controls are implemented.<br>
 Chemical must be used within DET (NSW Department of Education and Training) restrictions<br>
 Extremely toxic<br>
 Handle with great caution.<br>
 Teacher use only, i.e. sodium cyanide.<br>
 Toxic<br>
 Where the chemical has not been fully assessed and detailed information is not available, the general term "toxic" is used to warn of a possible hazard.<br>
 Toxic by all routes<br>
 The phrase toxic by all routes of exposure indicates the substance is toxic by ingestion, inhalation and skin contact.<br>
 Packing group<br>
 I Extreme danger<br>
 II Medium danger<br>
 III Low danger<br>
 UN United Nations number (for Dangerous Goods only)<br>
 CAS Number assigned to the chemical in the Individual Chemical Abstracts.<br>
