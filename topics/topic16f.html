<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.73.0H">12.73.0</a> Reactions of sodium with water<br>
<a href="../images/3.73.1ch.gif">See diagram 3.73.1</a>: Sodium with water, Sodium in water and under kerosene<br>
<b>Be careful!</b> Check the safety rules in your school system before doing this dangerous experiment<br>
2Na (s) + 2H2O (l) --> 2NaOH (aq) + H2 (g)<br>
sodium + water --> sodium hydroxide + hydrogen gas<br>
This is a type of redox reaction where the oxidation number of the metal increases.<br>
1. <b>Be careful!</b> Check the safety rules in your school system before doing this dangerous experiment.<br>
Use safety glasses and nitrile chemical-resistant gloves.<br>
The reaction of sodium with water is very vigorous, because it floats on the surface, fizzes (spits), and melts, because of the 
exothermic reaction, to form a strong alkaline solution, pH 12-14.<br>
2. The following experiments use a test-tube to observe the reaction of sodium with water, but some teachers use a beaker.<br> 
full of water instead to avoid problems of confining the reaction in a test-tube.<br>
Cover the beaker with wire gauze immediately after adding the sodium.<br>
Do not try to hold the sodium in place on the surface of the water to collect the hydrogen produced, because the gas may ignite or explode.<br>
A safe way of demonstrating the reactions of sodium and water is to drop a very small piece of sodium into a swimming pool, and stand back!.<br>
3. Pour a 2 cm layer of kerosene on to the surface of water in a test-tube.<br>
Drop a 3 mm diameter side cube of sodium into the kerosene.<br>
Adjust the layer of kerosene to be shallow enough to allow the top of the sodium to protrude above the surface.<br>
This reaction of sodium with the water is much slower than if the sodium had been dropped directly on to the water.<br>
You can watch the reaction through a magnifying glass held at the side, but never look down into a test-tube.<br>
Sodium metal is lighter than water, but heavier than kerosene.<br>
<b>Be careful!</b> Sodium sinks in the kerosene and floats in the water.<br>
A small area of the sodium suddenly reacts causing a stream of hydrogen bubbles to appear.<br>
The stream of bubbles at one side causes movement.<br>
The irregular shape of the sodium changes to a sphere.<br>
The sodium melts, because the reaction gives off heat.<br>
Note any variations in light refraction and reflection below the sodium that suggests something dissolving in the water.<br>
Slight smoke where the hot sodium is above the kerosene level suggests a slight reaction with air.<br>
Test the gas bubbles for oxygen gas or hydrogen gas.<br>
4. <b>Be careful!</b> Use a piece of sodium the size of a wheat grain or rice grain.<br>
Do not point the open end of a test-tube containing sodium at anybody.<br>
The experiment can be done on an overhead projector.<br>
Put water into a Petri dish and add a few drops of phenolphthalein.<br>
Put the Petri dish on an overhead projector.<br>
Use forceps to take a small lump of metallic sodium stored under kerosene and wipe with a piece of filter paper.<br>
Cut a piece of sodium the size of a red bean from the lump and then put it in the Petri dish.<br>
Observe from the screen that the sodium grain floats on the water to melt into a small sphere, which moves very rapidly in all directions,
 and becoming smaller and smaller.<br>
At last, the sodium sphere wholly disappears and the solution in the dish also changes its colour from colourless to red.<br>
5.<b>Be careful!</b> Observe the reaction through the side of the test-tube.<br>
Do not look down into the test-tube!.<br>
Put a piece of sodium in 2 cm of water in a test-tube.<br>
Do not point the open end of the test-tube at anybody!.<br>
Test for hydrogen gas with a lighted splint.<br>
Test the contents with litmus paper or phenolphthalein.<br>
The reaction forms sodium hydroxide.<br>
6.<b>Be careful!</b> Observe the reaction through the side of the test-tube.<br>
Do not look down the test-tube!.<br>
Pour a 3 mm layer of kerosene (paraffin oil) on to the surface of water in a test-tube.<br>
Drop a small piece of sodium into the test-tube.<br>
The sodium sinks in the kerosene and floats in the water.<br>
The layer of kerosene should be shallow enough to let the top of the sodium protrude above the surface.<br>
The reaction of sodium with water is much slower than if the sodium had been dropped directly on to the water.<br>
A small area of the sodium suddenly reacts, which causes a stream of bubbles to appear.<br>
The irregular shape of the sodium changes to that of a sphere.<br>
The sodium melts, because the reaction forms heat.<br>
Something dissolving in the water below the sodium can be seen.<br>
Some smoke where the hot sodium is above the kerosene level suggests a reaction with air.<br>
Test the gas bubbles for hydrogen gas.<br>
7. Support a short length of glass tubing vertically with one end 2 cm below the surface of water.<br>
Test the water with moist litmus paper.<br>
Add litmus paper to the water.<br>
The upper part of the tube must be quite dry.<br>
Drop a piece of sodium down the tube.<br>
Note the reaction.<br>
Test for hydrogen gas with a lighted splint.<br>
Test the water with litmus paper.<br>
The water becomes alkaline.<br>
2Na (s) + 2H2O (l) --> H2 (g) + 2NaOH (aq)<br>
8. Remove a small lump of sodium from storage under oil.<br>
Observe the layer of oxide / hydroxide on the surface of the sodium.<br>
Cut a pea-size piece from the surface of the sodium.<br>
Observe the shiny sodium metal surface that rapidly darkens, because of reaction with air and moisture.<br>
9. Demonstrate the reaction of sodium with water in a fume cupboard or outside if students are protected by a safety shield, 
or wearing safety glasses.<br>
Use a large beaker filled with water to within 1 cm of the top, so that there is no space for air / hydrogen mixture to accumulate.<br>
Add a piece of sodium no greater in size than a rice grain, 3 mm diameter.<br>
Use a wire gauze on top of the beaker to prevent the ejection of sodium.<br>
The sodium fizzes around the surface of the water for a few seconds, reacting violently.<br>
Add an acid / base indicator to the water, e.g. universal indicator or phenolphthalein, to demonstrate the alkalinity of the reaction products.<br>
Demonstrate the disposal of waste sodium by reaction with ethanol or methylated spirit in a beaker in the fume cupboard as described above.<br>
The sodium and may catch fire with the following reaction:<br>
Na + H2O--> Na+ + OH- + 1/2H2 (g)<br>
10. Place sodium on wet absorbent paper and observe the ignition of the hydrogen gas.<br>
This experiment can be used to test for the presence of alcohols.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.4.7H">19.4.7</a> Phthalic acid, Phthalates<br>
Phthalic acid C8H6O4, C6H4(CO2H)2, benzene-1,2-dicarboxylic acid, formerly from naphthalene, aromatic dicarboxylic acid, has many isomers.<br>
Made by oxidation reaction using naphthalene + potassium permanganate or potassium dichromate.<br>
Phthalic anhydride, C8H4O3, C6H4(CO)2O, benzene-1,2-dicarboxylic anhydride, phthalandione, Toxic, strong skin irritant, 
used to produce phthalic esters, chemical plasticisers, plastics from vinyl chloride, large scale production to make plasticisers.<br>
Phthalates<br>
Phthalates, C6H4(COOR1)(COOR2) are esters of phthalic acid, [C6H4(COOH)2].<br>
Phthalates are used as chemical plasticizers and to make polymers and alkyd resins, and to soften polyvinyl chloride (PVC).<br>
They are used to make shower curtains, PVC piping and inflatable products.<br>
Alkyd resins are usually made from glycerol and phthalate anhydride for paint, car parts, electric switches and insulators, electronic components
 and television parts.<br>
Phthalates are not chemically bound to the plastics they are added to, so they may be continuously released to the air as plastics harden over time.<br>
So their use is being phased out in some countries, because of concern about possible risk to foetuses and young children.<br>
Phthalates include the following:<br>
Bisphenol-A (BPA), Epoxy resin polymer<br>
| DPB, dibutyl phthalate | DNOP, di-n-octyl phthalate | DiNP di-isononyl phthalate | DEP, diethyl phthalate | BBzP, benzyl butyl phthalate | Di-isononyl phthalate
| DEHP, di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate | DiDp, diisodecyl phthalate | DnHP, i-n-hexyl phthalate | DnOP, di-n-octyl phthalate |<br>
 <a href="../images/16.13.8chd.gif">See diagram16.13.8</a>: Dimethyl phthalate, DMP, (C2H3O2)C6H4, insecticide.<br>
Phthalates<br>
While some phthalates such as DEHP are now banned for certain products, they could still be having an effect as they degrade slowly.<br>
Even very small amounts of phthalates have been shown to interact with other toxins and have cumulative effects.<br>
The common phthalates are DEHP (cheap to use), DBP, DIDP and DINP.<br>
DEHP was banned in Australia in 2011 for certain products, including children's toys (less than 36 months of age), and eating utensils, 
if the concentration of DEHP exceeded 1 percent.<br>
So DEHP can still be present, quite legally in minute amounts in many plastic products.<br>
DEHP, di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate, [dioctyl phthalate, DOP], C6H4(C8H17COO)2, most common phthalate plasticizer.<br>
DBP, dibutyl phthalate, C16H22O4, banned in cosmetics in EU, suspected endocrine disruptor.<br>
DiNP di-isononyl phthalate, C26H42O4, EU restriction.<br>
Avoid plastic containers and bottles with the recycling codes 1, 3, 6 or 7.<br>
If they have no number, avoid those by checking the bottom of the product for the number in a triangle.<br>
These are the typical plastics to avoid:<br>
Recycling code 1 are PET (polyethylene terephthalate): Found in water bottles, soft drink bottles.<br>
Recycling code 3 are PVC (polyvinyl chloride): Found in cling film, food packaging, cooking oil bottles and toys.<br>
Recycling code 6 are PS (polystyrene) Found in disposable plates /cups / trays, egg cartons and takeaway containers.<br>
Recycling code 7 are PC (polycarbonate) and others.<br>
Found in baby bottles, large water containers.<br>
