<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.1.1H">19.1.1 </a> Acid-base indicators in the home:<br>
 Acids are used to give tartness to foods, or to alter the acidity of the medium.<br>
They are used to lower the pH in canned products, and to prevent the crystallization of jams and jellies.<br>
 Bases are used as ingredients of baking powders used in pastry production, and in powders for effervescent beverages.<br>
 Improving agents includes chemical compounds that enhance the quality criteria of foods and substances used for polishing and glazing confectionery products.<br>
 Experiment<br>
 Use grape juice or red cabbage juice for acid-base indicators.<br>
 Note the sour tastes of fruit and vinegar and the taste of baking soda.<br>
 Grape juice turns red in acid lemonade and blue in alkaline dishwater.<br>
 Use flower pigments as pH indicators.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.1.2H">19.1.2</a> Acidulated water<br>
 Acidulated water is water that has been made slightly acidic by the addition of an acid substance such as lemon juice or vinegar.<br>
 Add about one teaspoon lemon juice or vinegar to half a litre of water.<br>
 Peeled fruit and vegetables such as apples, pears, celeriac, globe artichokes and salsify are immersed in acidulated water to prevent them from discolouring.<br>
 Acidulated water can also be used for cooking, for example, cauliflower will become snowy white if boiled in acidulated water.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.1.3H">19.1.3</a> Cooking fats, Shortening, Lard<br>
Shortening is solid, white fat made from hydrogenated vegetable oil.<br>
Solid fats from coconuts are quite saturated.<br>
Lard is the rendered fat from pig abdomen.<br>
Deep frying requires fats / oils with heat tolerant properties, e.g. corn oil and peanut oils, but not butter, margarine, lard and olive oil.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.1.4H">19.1.4</a> Emulsifying agents<br>
Emulsifying (surface active) agents, "food soaps" (E433-444) are used to stabilize emulsions of oil and water components in foods.<br>
In pharmacy, emulsifying agents, (emulsifiers or emulgents), are used to stabilize of the droplets, (globules), of the internal phase of an emulsion.<br>
They inhibit flocculation, creaming, and coalescence.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.1.5H">19.1.5</a> Food acids, acids in foods<br>
Food acids are naturally occurring or added substances in food that can enhance flavor, preserve freshness, and maintain pH levels.<br> 
For example: citric acid in citrus fruits, acetic acid in vinegar, and lactic acid in yogurt.<br> 
Ethanoic acid</a>, acetic acid, vinegar<br>
Benzoic acid</a>, in cranberries, prunes and plums<br>
Butyric acid</a>, in decomposition of butter, rancid butter<br>
Citric acid</a>, C6H8O7, in citrus fruits, lemon, orange, cocoa, pepper, rhubarb<br>
Tartaric acid</a> in grapes, pineapples, potatoes, carrots.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.1.6H">19.1.6</a> Leavening agents<br>
Leavening is foaming in batters and dough to make the final product lighter and softer to eat.<br>
1. Mechanical leavening agents includes whisking cream or egg whites to make air foams for sponge cakes, batters and meringues.<br>
Also, beating white sugar with butter, creaming, is used to make cookies.<br>
2. Chemical leavening agents are usually baking powder (a mixture), and baking soda (sodium bicarbonate, sodium hydrogencarbonate.<br>
They react with acidic ingredients to form carbon dioxide bubbles in the mixture.<br>
Acidic ingredients include buttermilk, chocolate, cream of tartar (potassium bitartrate), fruit preserves, lemon juice, molasses, monocalcium phosphate, 
sodium aluminium phosphate, sodium aluminium sulfate, sour milk, vinegar, and yoghurt.<br>
Cream of tartar is the most common ingredient in baking powder mixtures.<br>
However, "double acting" baking powder may use monocalcium phosphate and sodium aluminium sulfate to slow the release of carbon dioxide.<br>
The best combination of a leavening agent with an acidic ingredient cannot be decided in the chemistry laboratory.<br>
Different combinations affect speed of carbon dioxide release, flavour development, surface browning, texture, moisture content and palatability.<br>
The best combination must be decided by cooks and people who pay for and consume the end products.<br>
3. Biological leavening agents include generation of carbon dioxide by yeast fermentation for production of fermented food.<br>
Bakers' yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) from the brewing industry is used to make bread and cakes.<br>
Baking yeast is in two forms, compressed yeast cake and active dry yeast.<br>
The "brewer's yeast" sold in health food stores for nutritional purposes is not an active yeast so is not a leavening agent.<br>
Lactobacillus bacteria (over 120 species), is used to make cheese, chote, cider, kimchi, pickles, sauerkraut, silage, sourdough bread, wine, yoghurt.<br>
Natural yeasts and strains of lactobacillus, both from the air, vary in their characteristics in different places.<br>
Local products such as beer and baked products, may have their own eating characteristics and taste.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.1.7H">19.1.7</a> Polyhydric alcohols<br>
Polyhydric alcohols are used as a humectant to keep from drying.<br>
They may also be sweet, e.g. sugarless chewing gum may contain mannitol (E421) sorbitol (E420) and glycerol (E422).<br>
They may have the same calorific value as cane sugar, 16.5 kj / g.<br>
Examples: Dulcitol, Galactinol, Glycerol, myo-Inositol, d-Mannitol, Pinitol (monomethyl ether), Quebrachitol, Quercitol, d-Sorbitol<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.1.8H">19.1.8</a> Sequestrants<br>
 Sequestrants, sequestering agents, either removes an ion or makes it ineffective by forming a complex with it, e.g. a chelate complex.<br>
 An example is the sequestration of Ca2+ ions in water softening.<br>
 A sequestrant binds with metal ions to prevent them from catalysing chemical reactions that spoil preserved food.<br>
 Metals such as copper, iron and nickel get into food from processing machinery or because of chemical reactions with the container.<br>
 The sequestrant citric acid acts as a synergist (increases the effect) for antioxidants.<br>
 Sequestrants are used in shortenings, mayonnaise, lard, margarine, cheese.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.1.9H">19.1.9.</a> Wheat and flour<br>
 1. Bread and noodle wheat are the dominant types of wheat planted throughout Australia.<br>
 They fall into classifications that have different receivable standards.<br>
 From APH (Australian Prime Hard), with high quality requirements through to FEED, which has limited quality requirements.<br>
 Queensland conditions are conducive to the production of high quality grain and the breeding and development of new varieties reflects these conditions.<br>
 Flour milled from Australian Prime Hard wheat is used to produce high-protein, Chinese-style, yellow, alkaline noodles and Japanese ramen noodles.<br>
 Australian Prime Hard flour is also suitable for the production of high-protein, high-volume breads and wanton dumpling skins.<br>
 Australian Prime Hard can be blended with lower-protein wheat to produce flours suitable for a wide range of baked products.<br>
2. Durum wheat, (Triticum durum), is used for pasta products, which needs is grain of high protein, preferably more than 13% and a minimum of 11.5 %.<br>
 Grain appearance is also important, because downgrading can occur due to black point, weather damage and mottling.<br>
 Acceptable levels of black points are as follows: ADR1 3%, ADR2 5% and ADR3 20%.<br>
3. Soft wheat represents two distinct types.<br>
 The Soft Biscuit type, (9 to 105% protein), is for the biscuit industry, and the Soft Noodle type (9 to 11.5% protein), for cakes, pastry and white salted noodles.<br>
 Soft Biscuit types are best grown using irrigation and suitable crop management to achieve target protein levels.<br>
 Capped domestic market volumes exist so growers should seek pre-plant contracts.<br>
4. Feed wheat is generally high yielding varieties that have quality limitations for use in flour and noodle production.<br>
5. Forage wheat is commonly the winter type and have the major advantage of adaptability to a wide range of sowing times.<br>
 The winter habit delays maturity in early sowing, thus extending the period of vegetative growth.<br>
 Maturity varies once vernalization requirements have been met.<br>
 In Australia, winter wheat is usually sown in late March or early April.<br>
 6. Effects of grain defects on end-product quality<br>
 * Black point, excessive levels may result in "specky" semolina or discoloured bran, wheat germ and divide flours (pastry flour).<br>
 The end products are often visually unattractive, especially with durum products, e.g. pasta.<br>
 * Sprouting, (low falling number), the product is affected by high levels of alpha amylase in the flour, causing "key holing" in bread, fragile noodles, and discolouring.<br>
 Sprouting has a small impact on pasta except at FN (falling numbers) &lt; 200 seconds.<br>
 * Frost damage can cause low failing number, reduced flour yield, increased grain hardness and very poor baking performance for bread, biscuits and breakfast cereals.<br>
 * Excessive screenings causes reduced grain and flour yield (so loss of profitability), but has little effect on end product quality, except excess screenings and heat damage.<br>
 Samples tested with high screenings have poor baking quality.<br>
 This may be attributed to heat stress damage during grain filling, which was also believed to be responsible for the high screenings.<br>
 *. Low density reduced grain and flour yield (loss of profitability), has little effect on end-product quality, excluding low density due to frost and heat stress damage.<br>
 * Heat damage due to drying at temperatures above 600 oC, the flour produced from this grain is of poor baking quality and baked products are often unsaleable.<br>
 In Australia, winter wheat is usually sown in late March or early April.<br>
Flour<br>
7. Prepare self-leavened flour, "self-raising flour"<br>
 Plain flour and self-raising flour<br>
 "Plain flour" is "wheat flour" made from the endosperm "kernels" of wheat grains by grinding and sifting.<br>
 "Self-raising flour" contains plain flour and baking soda, sodium hydrogencarbonate.<br>
 Experiments<br>
8. In the kitchen, to test whether flour is plain flour or self-raising flour, place a little on your tongue.<br>
 * If you feel a tingle, this indicates that the flour is self-raising flour.<br>
 * Use self-leavened flour to make steamed bread.<br>
 Mix the flour with water without addition of any baking soda.<br>
 Knead the dough and let it stand for 10 to 15 minutes.<br>
 This kind of flour is made by blending a small quantity of chemical sponging agent, also called baking powder, with ordinary flour.<br>
 Sponging agent contains 20 to 40% of NaHCO3, and 35 to 50% of acidic substances, e.g. sodium dihydrogen phosphate, and filling agents, e.g. starch.<br>
 NaHCO3 reacts with acidic substances to produce carbon dioxide, while the acidic substances decompose the carbonate to lower the basicity of finished products.<br>
 The filling agents are used to prevent the flour from moisture absorption, agglomeration and loss of effects.<br>
 They can also regulate the forming rate of gas or make the bubbles be evenly produced.<br>
 When water is added to self-leavened flour, the hydrolysis of NaHCO3 shows basicity, while hydrolysis of sodium dihydrogen phosphate shows acidity.<br>
 The reaction results in release of carbon dioxide.<br>
 Heat decomposes NaHCO3 to make spongy steamed bread.<br>
 8. Mix equal parts flour and salt, and add one teaspoon white vinegar to make a paste.<br>
 Spread a thick layer on the brass and let dry.<br>
 Rinse and wipe off paste.<br>
 9. Use flour to make glue.<br>
 Mix flour and water to a pancake batter consistency for use on paper, light-weight fabric, and cardboard.<br>
 10. Use flour to make papier-mâché.<br>
 Mix one cup flour with two thirds cup water in a medium size bowl to a thick glue consistency.<br>
 To thicken, add more flour.<br>
 Cut newspaper strips approximately 2 to 4 cm in width.<br>
 Dip each strip into the paste, gently pull it between your fingers to remove excess paste, and apply it to any object (an empty bottle, carton, or canister).<br>
 Repeat until surface you want to cover (clay, cartons, bottles, or any disposable container makes a good base).<br>
 Continue until the base is completely covered.<br>
 Let dry, then decorate with poster paint.<br>
 After the paint dries, coat with shellac.<br>
 11. Use flour to make play dough.<br>
 Add five drops food colouring to two cups water.<br>
 Then add two cups flour, one cup salt, one teaspoon cream of tartar, and two tablespoons vegetable oil.<br>
 Mix well.<br>
 Cook and stir over medium heat for three minutes (or until the mixture holds together).<br>
 Turn onto board or cookie sheet and kneed to proper consistency.<br>
 Store in an airtight container.<br> 

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.1.10H">19.1.10</a> Test for ascorbic acid with dipsticks<br>
 1. Use dipsticks to measure vitamin C content in fruit juices.<br>
 The content may be more than in the original fruit, because the processor adds the minimum to replace any vitamin that has not survived processing and storage.<br>
 2. Test the effect of boiling vitamin C in water.<br>
 3. Test the effect of cooking at different pH values by adding sodium carbonate of soda.<br>
 4. Test the effect of boiling in the absence of oxygen.<br>
 If blend vegetables and measure vitamin C content before and after, you will find a large increase, because the boiling extracts the soluble vitamin from the food.<br>
 5. Test your urine and establish how much you excrete after taking a dose (1 -2 g) over a period of one day?<br>
 Measure the volume of urine and the concentration of vitamin C.<br>
 Plot the amount of the original vitamin remaining, and the rate of excretion during the day.<br>

 <hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.1.11H">19.1.11</a> Test for pH of solid acids<br>
Divide the solution in one test-tube into three portions in three different test-tubes.<br>
Test the first solution with litmus paper.<br>
Add drops of methyl orange solution to the second solution.<br>
Add drops of phenolphthalein solution to the third solution.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.1.12H">19.1.12</a> Prepare baking powder<br>
 Baking powder is a chemical leavening agent and sponging agent.<br>
 To prepare 10 g of baking powder, weigh 3 g of sodium hydrogencarbonate, 2 g of starch and 0.7 g of calcium phosphate.<br>
 Mix them with 5.3 g of sodium dihydrogen phosphate in a small beaker.<br>
 Weigh flour and the prepared sponging agent in the ratio of 50 to 1, and mix them thoroughly to make 20 g of self-leavened flour.<br>
 Add 15 mL water to the prepared self-leavened flour and knead the dough.<br>
 Lay aside the dough for 5-10 minutes (leaven dough) and then make the dough into spongy, delicious steamed bread by steaming for 15-20 minutes.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.1.13H">19.1.13</a> Make jelly with fresh pineapple and tinned pineapple<br>
 Fresh pineapple contains a powerful proteolytic enzyme called Bromelain, or Fruit bromelain, but in tinned pineapple it is inactivated.<br>
 So a pineapple garnish for ham, gammon, should be made of fresh pineapple, not tinned pineapple.<br>
 Fresh pineapple interferes with setting gelatine and whipped egg whites, because the enzyme is active.<br>
 Bromelain is a protease enzyme derived from the stems of pineapples
 It is composed of a mixture of different thiol endopeptidases and phosphatase, glucosidase, peroxidase, cellulase, and several protease inhibitors.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.1.14H">19.1.14</a> Table salt and rock salt<br>
 1. Common salt is sodium chloride crystals.<br>
 Common salt, rock salt, comes from the naturally occurring mineral of sodium chloride called halite.<br>
 It is often found as cubic crystals and associated with gypsum in Triassic rocks.<br>
 Sea salt is extracted from evaporated sea water.<br>
 Table salt may be rock salt or evaporated sea salt and contain iodine (iodized salt) anti-caking agents, e.g. anti-caking agent (554) and potassium iodate.<br>
 Kosher salt is a coarse salt with large crystals used for drawing blood from meat.<br>
 Pickling salt is a fine grained salt used for pickling and it contains no additives, e.g. anti-caking agents.<br>
 Grey sea salt, "Sel gris", is unprocessed, and has minerals from the sea.<br>
 Indian black salt, kala namak, has a brown black in colour and a smoky, sulfur flavour.<br>
 Rock salt is a grey colour, contains minerals and impurities, and is used in ice cream machines and for melting ice and snow on the roads using brine and sea sand.<br>
2. Table salt may be "iodized" by the addition of potassium iodide or potassium iodate.<br>
About 0.01% potassium iodide in table salt is added as a nutrient for the thyroid hormone thyroxine for those on an iodine deficient diet, which leads to goitre.<br>
 However, the iodide will oxidize in air to iodine that is lost through evaporation.<br>
 Thiosulfate was formerly used as a stabilizer, but now it is normally glucose, dextrose.<br>
 Because alkaline conditions prevent oxidation, bases such as sodium bicarbonate or phosphates may also be added.<br>
 Potassium iodate may be used to avoid these problems.<br>
3. Atmospheric moisture may cause the cubic crystals of sodium chloride to stick together and the salt does not flow.<br>
 This problem can be solved by using about 0.5% drying agents, e.g. carbonates (E501-4) and sodium aluminium silicate (E554).<br>
 Another method is to change the shape (habit) of the cubic salt crystals to a form that does not provide large flat surfaces to pack together.<br>
 Salt normally crystallizes as cubes, because the octahedral faces of the crystal consisting of either all Na+ or all Cl- grow faster than the 
 cubic faces with alternating Na+ and Cl-.<br>
 If an impurity is absorbed onto the surface of the fast growing octahedral faces, e.g. urea, the reverse happens, and octahedral crystals form instead of cubes.<br>
 So more than 13 ppm potassium ferrocyanide K4Fe(CN)6.3H2O), (E536), is added to table salt.<br>
 To avoid using the word "cyanide" on labels, the compound may be referred to as "yellow prussiate of potash" or the IUPAC name "hexacyanoferrate".<br>
Experiments<br>
 4. Sprinkling salt on water causes the surface to contract momentarily towards the crystals, while with pepper, the opposite tends to happen.<br>
 * Examine the label on a contained of table salt and note the contents in addition to sodium chloride.<br>
 * Prepare a freezing mixture and measure its temperature.<br>
 A mixture of ice and sodium chloride, freezing mixture, has temperature -20 oC.<br>
 The salt lowers the melting point of ice.<br>
 The salted ice is still at 0 oC, but above its new melting point. so it melts.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.1.15H">19.1.15</a> Prepare vinegar from wine<br>
1.  Gram negative acetic acid bacteria, (Acetobacter cerevisiae), has ellipsoidal to  rod-shaped cells.<br>
 It occurrssingly, in pairs, or short chains to form colonies that are beige to brown, round to wavy.<br>
 Its grows the substrates glucose, ethanol, organic acids, and glycerol.<br>
 It is an obligate aerobe so it requires oxygen.<br>
 It is often found on spoiled and unspoiled fruit and can be isolated from beer.<br>
 It is a spoilage organism converting ethanol to acetic acid.<br>
 It is sensitive to very low pH, but can grow at wine pH and survive low oxygen level.<br>
 Its optimum temperature is 20-25 oC.<br>
 It can withstand ethanol levels as high as 15%.<br>
 Acetic acid bacteria derive their energy from the oxidation of ethanol to acetic acid during respiration.<br>
 C2H5OH + O2 --> CH3COOH + H2O.<br>
2. Live vinegar, or vinegar culture, contains the acetobacter bacteria, which converts alcohol to acetic acid and produces the "motherother-of-vinegar".<br>
 It is a gelatinous slime of yeast and acetic acid bacteria that eventually forms on the surface of the wine vinegar mixture.<br>
 This smooth, leathery, greyish film becomes quite thick and heavy.<br>
 It should not be disturbed.<br>
 It often becomes heavy enough to fall and is succeeded by another formation.<br>
 If the "mother" falls, remove and discard it.<br>
 An acid test will indicate when all of the alcohol is converted to vinegar.<br>
 Wine making suppliers sell acid test kits and acetobacter as "mother" or vinegar culture.<br>
 Some of the vinegar can be withdrawn and pasteurized for use while the remaining unpasteurized vinegar containing the living bacteria may be used as a culture to start another batch.<br>
 So a piece of the "mother" is not necessary to start a new batch of vinegar making.<br>
 Some people add diluted wine to the culture every 4 to 8 weeks, depending on the temperature and when most of the alcohol is converted to vinegar as determined by an acid test.<br>
 Adding more alcohol to the culture keeps it alive, prevents spoilage and increases the quality of vinegar.<br>
3. Acetic acid (ethanoic acid) is a weak acid, only about 1% dissociates in water, pH of 2-3, so it can be used for cooking, preserving 
 foods, salad dressings, with cooked fish, a cleaning aid and treating stings from marine animals.<br>
 CH3COOH (aq) &lt;--> CH3COO- (aq) + H+ (aq).<br>
 4. Pasteurizing kills vinegar bacteria and prevents the formation of the "mother", which could lead to spoilage.<br>
Pasteurized vinegar keeps indefinitely if tightly capped and stored in a dark place at room temperature, but above high temperature cause a loss of acidity, flavour and aroma.<br>
 If unpasteurized vinegar is exposed to oxygen without alcohol present, bacteria can convert the vinegar to carbon dioxide and water.<br>
5. When first made, vinegar has a strong, sharp taste, but it becomes mellow with age when esters form as in wine.<br>
 If undisturbed, suspended solids fall to leave clear and bright vinegar that can be siphoned off into sanitized bottles with plastic caps.<br>
 Avoid stored vinegar contact with metal or air.<br>
 The quality of vinegar improves for up to two years and then gradually declines.<br>
 6. In Japan, the polished rice vinegar komesu and the unpolished rice vinegar kurosu are traditional seasonings that are made through 
 saccharification of rice, alcohol fermentation, and oxidation of ethanol to acetic acid.<br>
 An alcoholic liquid with vinegar, called moromi, is fermented in covered containers to prevent bacterial contamination.<br>
 A crepe pellicle of acetic acid bacteria, (Acetobacter genera), covers the moromi surface and the fermentation is allowed to continue for about a month.<br>
Experiments<br>
Prepare vinegar with (Acetobacter aceti)<br>
1. To prepare vinegar from wine, use 10-11% alcohol wine, although dilute the alcohol to 5.0 to 7% alcohol containing less than 10% alcohol is subject to spoilage.<br>
The alcohol concentration should not inhibit the activity of the bacteria that transform the wine.<br>
The vinegar process may not get started with over 12.5% alcohol or if the wine was treated with sulfur.<br>
Wine should contain no excess sugar, because it increases the chance of spoilage and the formation of a slime-like substance in the vinegar.<br>
The wine does not have to be clear before it is combined with the vinegar culture, because vinegar clears as it ages.<br>
Vinegar is a mixture of at least 5% acetic acid, if it is sold, with water and flavouring and colouring chemicals depending on the method of production, e.g. balsamic vinegar, apple vinegar, brown vinegar and white vinegar.<br>
2. The simplest method to prepare vinegar is to leave an open, 3/4 filled bottle of wine in a dark place, at 24-29 oC, for 6-8 weeks.<br>
Cover with netting to allow access to air, but to keep away vinegar flies.<br>
3. Use 2 measures of dry wine (11 to 12% alcohol), 1 measure of water (boiled 15 minutes and allowed to cool), 1 measure of vinegar culture with active bacteria.<br>
Some wines contain sulfites or preservatives that could kill the vinegar bacteria.<br>
4. For a steady supply of vinegar, use a 5 litre wide mouth glass or stainless steel container (not plastic), whose capacity is at least a gallon and pour one litre of wine and 200 mL of vinegar into it.<br>
Remove the cover for a half hour every day.<br>
In a couple of weeks, the madre (mother), a viscous starter, will have settled to the bottom of the jug, while the vinegar above it will be ready for use.<br>
Add more wine as you remove vinegar to keep the level in the jug constant.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.2.1H">19.2.1</a> Food allergies and intolerances, "hyperactive"<br>
 1. Some people can be sensitive to the effects of natural food chemicals.<br>
 Although the body becomes accustomed to small amounts of these substances in the daily diet, eating too much of certain foods or a sudden change of diet or infection, can alter the body's reaction.<br>
 The tastier a food is, the richer it is likely to be in natural chemicals, e.g. chocolate and mint.<br>
 Small amounts of natural chemicals present in a food, e.g. chocolate, may not be enough to cause a reaction by itself.<br>
 However, the chocolate may cause a reaction, because a chemical may be common to many different foods.<br>
 So a reaction occurs when the threshold is finally exceeded by eating the chocolate.<br>
 Organic foods may contain fewer traces of pesticides and other agricultural chemicals, but they contain the same natural pesticides and preservatives in the skin.<br>
 2. Food additives<br>
 People who are sensitive to natural food chemicals are usually also sensitive to food additives, e.g. preservatives to keep foods fresh and colourings to make foods look more attractive.<br>
 If you need to avoid these additives, check the labels.<br>
 3. Food intolerance, hyperactive<br>
 A food intolerance is any reaction to food not caused by the immune system, as in a food allergy.<br>
 The particular food can be identified only by excluding the suspect food from the diet, then later reintroducing it to see if the intolerance occurs again.<br>
 So there is no scientific test for "food intolerance".<br>
 Reactions to food chemicals are called intolerances.<br>
 They irritate different parts of the body causing headaches, mouth ulcers, stomach pains and bowel irritation.<br>
 Children may become "hyperactive" after eating a rich meal or coloured, flavoured and preserved foods or drinks during a children's birthday party.<br>
 However, sucrose sugar by itself does not cause hyperactivity in children.<br>
 In sensitive people, natural chemicals may build up to cause recurrent symptoms.<br>
 They should avoid spicy foods and processed foods.<br>
4. Food allergy<br>
 A food allergy is an adverse reaction to a generally harmless substance within a food, triggered by the immune system.<br>
 It is caused by antibodies to food proteins from particular foods, e.g. milk, eggs, wheat, peanuts or fish.<br>
 A food allergy may cause itching mouth, vomiting and cramps.<br>
 People sensitive to natural food chemicals are usually also sensitive to one or more of the common food additives.<br>
 Egg allergy to proteins in the white and yolk of eggs are more common in very young children although adults seem to have more yolk allergy than children.<br>
5. Oil allergy<br>
 Margarine and oils may be preserved to stop them going rancid, but cold pressed oils are not preserved, e.g. cold pressed coconut oil.<br>
 Sunflower and safflower oils sometimes contain antioxidants.<br>
 Margarine is sometimes preserved fat reduced ("light").<br>
 Spreads are usually preserved.<br>
 Heavily flavoured fats and oils, e.g. olive oil, corn oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, walnut oil, almond oil, all contain moderate to high levels of natural chemicals.<br>
 Cow or goat milk, cream and butter are all very low in natural chemical content.<br>
6. Starch allergy<br>
 Refined rice products and wheaten cornflour (gluten powder, wheat starch), are the lowest in natural chemicals, though some people prefer whole grain and wholemeal products.<br>
 Potato products may contain preservatives (220 to 228), or antioxidants if cooked in oil.<br>
7. Sugar allergy, hyperactivity<br>
 Refined sugar in moderation usually causes no adverse effects.<br>
 Avoid all sweets with colours and flavours other than vanilla.<br>
 Most dried fruits are preserved with sulfite that may cause asthma attacks.<br>
 Sun dried fruits without preservative have a very high natural chemical content.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2">19.2.H". 19.2.1 Amine intolerance<br>
 Amines come from protein breakdown or fermentation.<br>
 Large amounts are present in cheese, chocolate, wines, beer, yeast extracts and fish products.<br>
 They are also found in certain fruits and vegetables, e.g. bananas, avocados, tomatoes and broad beans.<br>
 You also make tiny amounts of some amines in your own body, e.g. Adrenaline, (Epinephrine).<br>
 Amines increase with ripening in fruits that go soft, e.g. banana and avocado.<br>
 Highly sensitive people should wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly before eating, thickly peel pears and potatoes and discard the outer leaves of lettuce.<br>
 Yoghurt may have some amines.<br>
 Cheeses contain varying amounts of natural amines and MSG.<br>
 The tastier the cheese, the higher its chemical content is likely to be.<br>
 Soy milk and fresh products like tofu and tofu ice cream all have a low natural chemical content and so usually causes no chemical intolerance problems unless the person is allergic to soy bean proteins.<br>
 However, fermented products like soy sauce, tempeh and miso are rich in natural amines and MSG.<br>
 Browning meat, grilling or charring will increase natural amine levels, which make them more tasty.<br>
 Fresh meats, poultry, seafood, and eggs are all low in natural chemicals.<br>
 However, amines can form as a result of a protein breakdown in aged, overcooked and processed meats.<br>
 Pork, chicken skin, canned or frozen fish, liver, kidney and other offal contain high amine levels.<br>
 Purchase and eat raw meat within two days.<br>
 Processed meats are rich in amines, and may be preserved with nitrites, e.g. ham, bacon, corned beef.<br>
 Fish products, especially those that are salted, smoked, pickled or dried, are rich in amines and other natural chemicals.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.2.3H">19.2.3</a> Aspartame sweetener<br>
Aspartame, HOOCCH2CH(NH2)CONHCH(CH2C6H5)COOCH3, N-(L-α-Aspartyl)-L-phenylalanine methyl ester.<br>
Aspartame is the name for the artificial, non-carbohydrate sweetener, aspartyl-phenylalanine-1-methyl ester, i.e. the methyl ester of the dipeptide of the amino acids aspartic acid and phenylalanine D-forms and L-forms, which are enantiomers (mirror image molecules), of each other.<br>
Aspartic acid, 2-aminobutanedioic acid, HOOCCH2CH(NH2)COOH, also called aspartate, the name of its anion, is one of the 20 natural proteinogenic amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins.<br>
The amount of aspartame in an average can of diet cola is about 0.06%.<br>
Aspartame is 160 times sweeter than sugar, sucrose with E number (additives code) E951.<br>
It is a common sweetener in prepared foods, particularly soft drinks.<br>
Aspartame is one of the sugar substitutes used by diabetics.<br>
Products containing aspartame usually have a warning label that they contain phenylalanine, in compliance with US FDA guidelines.<br>
Aspartame breaks down into its constituent amino acids when heated in the presence of water and acids.<br>
So it is unsuitable for use in baking, but is commonly in diet soft drinks or to sweeten coffee and tea.<br>
A soft drink is a drink that contains no alcohol.<br>
While aspartame, like other peptides, has a caloric value of 4 kilocalories per gram, the quantity of aspartame needed to produce a sweet taste is 
so small as to make its caloric contribution negligible, which makes it a popular sweetener for those trying to avoid calories from sugar.<br>
Some authorities suggest that aspartame is a risky chemical food additive, and its use during pregnancy and by children is one of the greatest tragedies in human history.<br>
Aspartame is synthesized from the two amino acids L-aspartic acid and L-phenylalanine, which are bonded by methanol.<br>
Aspartame breaks down easily and loses its sweetness when heated.<br>
Toxic levels of aspartame in the blood may result in mental retardation, altered brain function and behaviour changes in humans and cause side effects 
including dizziness, headaches and menstrual problems.<br>
Since the FDA approved aspartame for consumption in 1981, some researchers have suggested that a rise in brain tumour rates in the United States 
may be at least partially related to the increasing availability and consumption of aspartame and phenylalanine.<br>
Each sachet of the sweetener "Equal" contains | Dextrose C6H12O6 |  Aspartame, acesulfame potassium C4H4KNO4S | Starch,  (C6H10O5)n corn starch |
Silicon dioxide anti-caking agent SiO2 | Maltodextrin (D-glucose units), C6nH(10n+2)O (5n+1) |  and flavouring |.<br>
The tablet form may also contain α-Lactose monohydrate, C12H22O11.H2O.<br>
From the label: "1 EQUAL sachet is as sweet as 2 teaspoons of sugar (approximately 8 g), but it contains 1 /8 of the Calories of sugar for the same level of sweetness".<br>
EQUAL contains per 0.045 g tablet, Energy 0.6 kJ, Protein 0.01g, Fat, (Total) 0 g, Fat (Saturated) 0 g, Carbohydrates 0.02 g, Sugars 0.02 g, Sodium 0.3 mg.<br>

 Wheat may be a problem for people who cannot tolerate gluten.<br>
 Coeliac disease is an allergy to gluten.<br>
 Bread making flour may be preserved with sulfite, but most disappears during cooking.<br>
 Baking powder may be labelled "gluten free".<br>
 Gluten proteins | ω5-, ω1,2-, α-, and γ-gliadins | + high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) | + low-molecular-weight (LMW) GS |.<br> 
About 50% of gluten proteins have molecular weights, (MWs) 28,000 to 55,000.<br>
About 15% of gluten proteins are disulfide-linked oligomeric proteins (MWs) 70,000 to 700,000, called "HMW-gliadins".<br> 
About 35% of gluten proteins are disulfide-linked polymeric glutenins (MWs) 700,000 to 10 million. 
Intrachain disulfide bonds, which  occur in all types except ω-gliadins, stabilize the three-dimensional structure of gluten.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.2.5H">19.2.5</a> Lactose intolerance, lactose tolerance<br>
 Lactose intolerance is a problem for people who cannot tolerate lactose, (milk sugar).<br>
 Refined sugar in moderation usually causes no adverse effects.<br>
The milk sugar lactose is digested by lactase enzyme produced in the intestines.<br>
 It is essential for babies, so being not needed in adults its production in the body generally declines with age after the age of 5 years.<br>
 In a person with lactose intolerance the lactose is attacked by bacteria in the large intestine to produce bloating gases and diarrhoea.<br>
 However, some adults can still produce lactase, because of a mutation in the DNA that controls the lactase gene.<br>
 The mutation occurs in Northern Europea, East Africa and Saudi Arabia, and in other populations dependent on milk producing animals.<br>
 The same mutation may be quite common in the world.<br>

<a href="../images/16.3.6.0.1ch.gif">See diagram 16.3.6.0.1</a>: Monosodium glutamate.<br>
MSG, monosodium glutamate, sodium hydrogen glutamate, is the monosodium salt of glutamic acid, a natural amino acid and a building block of all proteins.<br>
 It is found naturally in most foods.<br>
 It is as an additive to increase the flavour of soups, sauces, Asian cooking and snack foods.<br>
 Umami is the savoury taste of glutamates, monosodium glutamate.<br>
 Excess MSG, often in Asian soup liquids, causes unpleasant "wooden tongue" feelings.<br>
 MSG is banned in prepared baby food.<br>
 It is produced by fermentation of sugars produced by acid hydrolysis of molasses or tapioca, using the bacterium (Corynebacterium glutanicum).<br>
 However, the MSG used to prepare cheap street foods may be adulterated.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.2.7H">19.2.7</a> Phenylalanine sweetener<br>
 Phenylalanine has the systematic name: (S)-2-Amino-3-phenyl-propanoic acid, chemical formula C9H11NO2, C6H5CH2CH(NH2)COOH.<br>
 So phenylalanine is classed as a phenylketonic.<br>
 The α-amino acid phenylalanine exists in two forms, the D-form and L-form, which are enantiomers, i.e. mirror image molecules, of each other.<br>
 L-phenylalanine (LPA), is an electrically neutral amino acid, one of the twenty common amino acids used to biochemically form proteins, coded for by DNA.<br>
 Its enantiomer, D-phenylalanine (DPA), can be synthesized artificially.<br>
L-phenylalanine is in living organisms, including the human body, where it is an essential amino acid.<br>
 The synthesized mix DL-phenylalanine (DLPA), which is a combination of the D-forms and L-forms, is as a nutritional supplement.<br>
Some authorities suggest that the amino acid DL-phenylalanine should be used with caution if you are pregnant or diabetic, if you have high blood pressure or suffer anxiety attacks.<br>
 Phenylalanine is part of the composition of aspartame, a common sweetener found in prepared foods (particularly soft drinks, and gum).<br>
 Phenylketonuria (PKU), is an inherited human genetic disorder of people without the ability to metabolize phenylalanine that occurs in about 1 in 15 000 births, but 1 in 4 500 births among the Irish.<br>
 Due to phenylketonuria, products containing aspartame usually have a warning label that they contain phenylalanine, in compliance with USA FDA guidelines.<br>
 Phenylalanine, a natural amino acid found in many foods, is deleterious only to sufferers of the genetic disorder phenylketonuria.<br>

 Salicylates are in medicine for painkilling, anti-inflammatory action and as preservatives in processed foods.<br>
 Salicylates include salicylic acid and sodium salicylates.<br>
 Salicylates usually do not cause harm to healthy adults, but aspirin may be harmful to children and to elderly people.<br>
Other salicylate painkillers include extract of the bark of the willow tree (Salix alba vulgaris, and oil from meadow sweet, (Spirea ulmaria).<br>
 Other naturally occurring salicylates are in many fruits and vegetables in very small amounts.<br>
 Aspirin, analgesic, acetylsalicylic acid (2-acetyloxybenzoic acid), is made in factories from salicylic acid, HOC6H4COOH, 1-hydroxybenzoic acid.<br>
 Methyl salicylate, oil of wintergreen, (Gaultheria procumbens), is used as a liniment for sore muscles.<br>
 Phenyl salicylates (salol), are used in sunscreens and as a stabilizer in plastics.<br>
 Salicylanilide, a compound of salicylic acid and aniline derivatives, is used as an antiseptic in soap.<br>
 Most fruits and many vegetables contain natural salicylates, and some also have high amine levels.<br>
 Salicylates have a natural preservative action and are concentrated near any surface of fruits and vegetables.<br>
 Levels of salicylates are higher in unripe fruits and decrease with ripening.<br>
 In many cases these natural chemicals are concentrated near the skin and you can avoid them by peeling, e.g. potatoes and pears.<br>
 Natural chemical content also varies with ripeness.<br>
 Salicylates are highest in unripe fruit, and decrease with ripening.<br>
 Flavoured or fruit yoghurt may also contain salicylates.<br>
 Spicy processed meats can contain salicylates or MSG, e.g. salami, seasoned meats, meat pies, sausages and sausage rolls, frankfurters, meat pastes and extracts.<br>

1. Coconut milk and cream are not prepared by boiling the mashed up kernel, but rather by pressing the material (at the kitchen level), in a cloth.<br>
Hot water is often added after the first press (which produces the creamier output), allowing a second pressing that delivers "milk".<br>
Commercially, there is mechanical pressing to generate thick cream and then various degrees of dilution are used to give diminishing fat content from 33% in cream down to maybe % in "lite".<br>
2. Coconut cream and coconut milk are both infusions of shredded coconut in water.<br>
Coconut meat is pounded or broken up by an electric blender to form a paste.<br>
Water is added then strained to remove solids, then left to stand and separate into a thick cream layer and a thin skim layer.<br>
Coconut milk can also be made from dry shredded coconut or it can be purchased from a supermarket.<br>
Coconut cream is thicker and more paste-like than coconut milk.<br>
Some people use milk to make it thicker.<br>
Coconut milk is a liquid.<br>
Coconut cream is rich in medium chain fatty acids and is used in the alcoholic drink Pina Colada.<br>
The creamed coconut sold in food stores is very concentrated coconut extract.<br>
It is a solid block at a low room temperature and can be made into coconut cream or coconut milk by mixing it with water.<br>
3. Coconut milk contains aromatic compounds plus oils.<br>
 It contains about 20% fat, while the more concentrated coconut cream contains up to 33% fat.<br>
Coconut milk may be used directly as a side dish with curries or a dressing for raw fish, as a refreshing drink, and in curry recipes.<br>
Coconut milk can be bought in tins and in packaged drinks in liquid and powdered form.<br>
Frozen coconut cream is sold in packets especially by Asian food suppliers.<br>
Dissolve the frozen block in hot water or chop it into pieces up and stir them directly into the curry towards the end of the cooking time.<br>
Never reheat any curry after adding the coconut!<br>
4. Coconut cream is what would eventually float to the top of the milk, and can be a semisolid at room temperature.<br>
Use 1 cup of water with 2 cups of scraped coconut.<br>
Leave to stand in a refrigerator.<br>
The cream will rise to the top and harden.<br>
Skim off the cream.<br>
5. Add a cup of coconut water or hot water to grated coconut meat.<br>
Leave to stand, and then squeeze with your hands.<br>
Put it into cheesecloth or a strainer.<br>
Squeeze out the coconut cream.<br>
6. To 2.5 cups boiling water add one grated coconut or 4 cups desiccated coconut.<br>
Leave to stand for 30 minutes.<br>
Squeeze the coconut and strain.<br>
Use within 24 hours.<br>
7. Simmer gently for 2 minutes over low heat a 4:1 mixture of shredded fresh or desiccated coconut meat (kernel, endosperm), and water.<br>
Stir continuously until foamy.<br>
Strain the liquid and squeeze the coconut with cheese cloth.<br>
Refrigerate the mixture to help the cream separate and set.<br>
8. Simmer equal volumes of shredded coconut and water or milk until froth forms.<br>
Strain the mixture through a cheesecloth.<br>
Squeeze out most of the liquid, i.e. the coconut milk.<br>
The thick coconut cream forms a separate layer above the coconut milk.<br>
9. Commercially prepared coconut cream in cans or other hygienic packaging may have an emulsifier added to thicken it.<br>

Vegetable oils are liquids at room temperature, so hydrogenation is used to break double bonds, saturate the chains with hydrogen and increase the MP.<br>
A legal definition of table margarine:<br>
"A mixture of edible fats, oils and water, a water in oil emulsion, with &lt; 16% water, &lt; 4% salt and &gt; 8.5 mg of vitamin A and &gt; 55 g of vitamin D per Kg."<br>
The P: S ratio is the ratio of polyunsaturated fat to saturated fat.<br>
A "heart-healthy" margarine should have a P: S ratio &gt; 2: 1.<br>
The term "polyunsaturated" is permitted where the proportion of cis-methylene interrupted polyunsaturated fatty acids in the margarine is &gt; 49%, the proportion of saturated fatty acids &lt; 20% of the total fatty acids, and the P/S ratio &gt; 2: 1.<br>
The total cholesterol content must appear on the packet as mg / 100 g.<br>
The remaining 40% of the fatty acids can be mono-unsaturated, e.g. oleic acid.<br>
A softer margarine that requires constant refrigeration has a P/S ratio 3: 1.<br>
Table margarine may contain antioxidants, flavouring, and vegetable colouring, e.g. usually carotene, a source of vitamin A, and which gives the colour to butter.<br>
The flavour of butter may be from 3-hydroxy-2-butanone, (CH3CH(OH)COCH3)2, and diacetyl (2,3-butanedione, dimethylglyoxal, C4H6O2).<br>
Previously, margarine contained coconut oil, but producers changed to soybean oil, because of concern about the high content of saturated fats in coconut oil.<br>
New margarine-like products do contain coconut oil, with non-genetically modified and naturally cholesterol-free vegetable oils, but not palm oil, e.g. "Nuttelex".<br>
Margarine label:<br>

Olive oil is composed mainly of triglycerides, composed of a mixture of three fatty acids, and small quantities of free fatty acids (FFA), glycerol, phosphatides, pigments, flavour compounds, and sterols.<br>
The major fatty acids in olive oil triglycerides are:<br>
Oleic acid</a>, monounsaturated omega-9 fatty acid, 55 to 83% of olive oil.<br>
Linoleic acid</a>, polyunsaturated omega-6 fatty acid, 3.5 to 21% of olive oil.<br>
Palmitic acid</a>, saturated fatty acid, 7.5 to 20% of olive oil.<br>
Stearic acid</a>, saturated fatty acid, 0.5 to 5% of olive oil.<br>
Linolenic acid</a>, alpha-linolenic acid, polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acid, 0 to 1.5% of olive oil.<br>
Olive oil contains more oleic acid and less linoleic and linolenic acids than other vegetable oils, so it is more monounsaturated than polyunsaturated fatty acids.<br>
So olive oil is more resistant to oxidation, because if more double bonds in a fatty acid, it is more unstable and easily broken down by heat and light.<br>
Olive oil is the most stable cooking oil, because it also contains a steroid stabilizer, so it needs no refining, preservatives or refrigeration.<br>
Some people do not fry in olive oil, because of the low smoke point, 165-190 oC, but olive oils produce less toxic aldehydes than other cooking oils and can be used safely for frying for up to 10 times.<br>
Olive oil contains no preservatives, but keeps much longer than other edible oils, particularly if kept in an air-tight container and away from heat and light.<br>
However, olive oil kept in a refrigerator becomes thick and cloudy.<br>
Olive oil: smoke point: 204 oC, P/S ratio: 0.5<br>
Trade names:<br>
1. "Olive oil", is usually a refined or blended oil with acid content less than 3.3%.<br>
2. "Virgin Olive oil" is a premium oil with excellent aroma and flavour, maximum acid content 1.5-2.0 %, for cooking and salad dressing (3 parts olive oil, 1 part vinegar or lemon juice).<br>
3. "ExtraVirgin Olive Oil", best quality edible oil, maximum acid content 1.0 %.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.4.1H">19.4.1</a> Tests for glucose, Clinitest tablet<br>
 Clinitest tablet is a form of Benedict's test for glucose<br>
 Add 10 drops of water to five drops of urine and add one Clinitest tablet.<br>
 The solution effervesces then boils without heating with a Bunsen burner, because the Clinitest tablet contains sodium hydroxide and citric acid besides Benedict's reagent.<br>
 If the solution turns blue the test is negative.<br>
 If the solution turns green to orange or an orange flash, the test is positive.<br>
 This oxidation method to measure blood glucose is based on the reducing properties of glucose.<br>
 Glucose will reduce cupric salts to cuprous salts it a hot alkaline solution and the quantity of cuprous salts produced is proportional to the glucose concentration.<br>
 Oxidation methods to measure blood sugar give results higher than other methods, because they also measure reduction of some non-glucose substances.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.4.2H">19.4.2</a> Tests for glucose, Clinistix strip<br>
 Test for glucose, test for (+) glucose in urine, indicator substance o-toluidine "Clinistix" strip is impregnated with the enzymes glucose oxidase and peroxidase, and a chromogen system, the indicator substance o-toluidine.<br>
 The o-toluidine is oxidized to a blue-green substance (Schiff base), with varying shades of colour, which is then compared with the standard chart provided in the kit to report the approximate level of glucose present in the urine.<br>
 Compared to Benedict's test, which detects the total sugar present in urine, the strip test detects semi-quantitatively the amount of glucose present in urine.<br>
 Dip the reagent area of the "Clinistix" strip in fresh urine for two seconds.<br>
 Gently tap the edge of the strip against the side of the urine container to remove excess urine.<br>
 Compare the test area closely with a colour chart exactly 30 seconds after dipping the strip in the urine.<br>
 Hold the strip close to the colour chart and match carefully.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.4.3H">19.4.3</a> Tests for glucose, blood glucose<br>
 Glucose tolerance test<br>
 After fasting, blood glucose is measured then the patient drinks 50 g of glucose dissolved in 100 mL of water.<br>
 Samples of urine are collected periodically, e.g. every half hour for two hours.<br>
 Fasting blood glucose is about 80 to 120 mg / 100 mL and after two hours blood glucose should be &lt; 120 mg / 100 mL.<br>
 If blood glucose exceeds 150 mg / mL (and fasting blood glucose was &gt; 120 mg / 100 mL) the diagnosis is diabetes mellitus.<br>
 Glucose does not pass into the urine unless blood glucose is up to 180 mg / 100 mL, the renal threshold.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.4.4H">19.4.3</a> Tests for glucose concentration, ferricyanide test<br>
Glucose reduces yellow ferricyanide to colourless ferrocyanide in a hot alkaline solution.<br>
The decrease of yellow colour is proportional to the glucose concentration.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.4.5H">19.4.5</a> Tests for glucose, Nelson-Somogyi test<br>
 The reducing sugars when heated with alkaline copper tartrate reduce the copper from the cupric to cuprous state and thus cuprous oxide is formed.<br>
 When cuprous oxide is treated with arsenomolybdic acid, the reduction of molybdic acid to molybdenum blue takes place.<br>
 The blue colour developed is compared with a set of standards in a colorimeter at 620 nm.<br>
 Non-glucose reducing substances can be removed to produce a protein-free filtrate by use of acids to precipitate proteins from the sample thus removing interference with colour reactions, turbidity and foaming, e.g. the zinc sulfate-barium hydroxide method of Nelson-Somogyi is said to give the closest value of "true glucose".<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.4.6H">19.4.6</a> Tests for glucose, glucose oxidase test<br>
 Enzyme methods for measurement of blood glucose are quite specific for glucose only, e.g. the enzymes glucose oxidase and hexokinase.<br>
 Glucose oxidase catalyses the oxidation of glucose to gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide.<br>
 glucose + O2 --> gluconic acid + H2O2<br>
 Hexokinase catalyses the phosphorylation of glucose in the presence of ATP.<br>
 Glucose-6-phosphate forms and is converted to 6-phosphogluconate by a second enzyme, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.<br>
 Then the NADPH can be measured.<br>
 glucose + ATP --> G-6-P + ADP<br>
G-6-P + NADP --> 6-phosphogluconate + NADPH + H+.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.4.7H">19.4.7</a> Tests for glucose, glycosylated haemoglobin test<br>
 If blood glucose level is high for some time, haemoglobin becomes glycosylated, i.e. the glucose molecule binds covalently to the last valine group of the β chain and stays there for the about 120 days the life of the red blood cell.<br>
 Measurement of blood glucose level is only a measure of the patient blood glucose level at the time of sampling, but measurement of glycosylated haemoglobin shows the blood glucose level for the preceding months.<br>

<a href="https://wellcomecollection.org/works/bcacfjpy">Urine Test Strips</a>, (Wellcome)<br>
 A pre-mixed synthetic urine called "Quick Fix" may be available.<br>
 Prepare artificial urine samples<br>
 Sample 1. Dissolve 1g serum albumin, 3g sodium chloride and 5g urea in 1 litre of water.<br>
 Sample 2. Dissolve 1g serum albumin, 3g sodium chloride and 1g glucose in 1 litre of water.<br>
 Test the artificial urine samples for colour, odour, turbidity (clear or cloudy) PH (universal indicator) protein (more cloudy in hot water) glucose ("Clinistix").<br>
 The tests for reducing sugars gives no values for fructose, galactose, or the non-reducing disaccharides, sucrose and lactose, but maltose does react.<br>
 The tests are used measure the hydrolysis of sucrose to glucose, (invertase or H+), the formation of glucose in germinating seeds, for glucose in urine and indirectly blood glucose.<br>
 The commonly used Benedict's test measures total reducing substance and does not accurately measure the amount of glucose present 
 in the blood, because of the presence of non-glucose reducing substances, e.g. glutathione, uric acid, ascorbic acid, and creatinine.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.4.9H">19.4.9 </a>Tests for glucose, urine test, Diastix strip<br>
 "Diastix" strip has an area impregnated with the above enzymes together with potassium iodide and a blue background dye.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.5.1H">19.5.1</a> Tests for ketones<br>
Excess ketones in urine is called ketonuria, associated with starvation, Diabetes mellitus, prolonged vomiting, and liver damage.<br>
 It also detects acetone, but not beta-hydroxybutyrate.<br>
 1. Add drops of 10% ferric chloride to 5 mL of urine.<br>
 Ferric phosphate forms, but dissolves in excess ferric chloride.<br>
 The solution turns brown-red if acetoacetic acid is present.<br>
 2. Rotheras's test, Acetest, Ketostix uses nitroprusside to detect acetone acetoacetic acid, and beta-hydroxybutyric acid, (BHB, is not an acetone).<br>
 Colour change from pink to purple, when acetoacetate reacts with nitroprusside.<br>
 Ketostix detects acetoacetate, but not BHB nor acetone.<br>
 Sodium nitroprusside dihydrate, Sodium nitroferricyanide, Na2[Fe(CN)5NO].2H2O.<br>
3. Acetoacetic acid and acetone react with alkaline solution of sodium nitroprusside to form a purple colored complex.<br> 
 But beta-hydroxybutyrate is not detected.<br>
 Rothera’s powder: Sodium nitroprusside = 0.75 gm, Ammonium sulphate = 20gm, Mix and pulverize. Ammonium hydroxide solution<br>
 Transfer about 5 ml of urine to a test tube.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.5.5H"></a>19.5.5 Tests for urine<br>
1. Reagent dipsticks ("Dip-stix") can be used to test for the following chemicals in a fresh urine sample:
 blood, protein, glucose, ketones, nitrite, N-acetyl-B-glucosaminidase, bilirubin, robilinogen.<br>
2. Specific gravity (relative density) test<br>
By using an indicator, the polyelectrolytes present in urine give various colours
The colours range deep blue-green in urine of low ionic concentration through green to yellow-green in urine of increasing ionic concentration.<br>
3. Urobilinogen test<br>
 Ehrlich's benzaldehyde reaction is a test for urobilinogen,  in the urine.<br>
 Dissolve 2 g of dimethyl-p-aminobenzaldehyde in 100 mL of 5% hydrochloric acid and add this reagent to urine.<br>
 A red colour in the cold indicates the presence of an excessive amount of urobilinogen.<br>
Urobilinogen, C33H44N4O6, is a colourless compound formed in the intestines by the reduction of bilirubin, C33H36N4O6.<br>
Some urobilinogen is excreted in the faeces where it is oxidized to urobilin, C33H42N4O6, that results from haemolysis or the breakdown of old red blood cells,<br>
Some urobilinogen is reabsorbed and re-excreted in the bile as bilirubin or re-excreted in the urine, where it may be later oxidized to urobilin.<br>
Bilirubin is used to produce bile in the liver, a fluid that helps digest fatty food in the intestines to act on faty food or is stored in the gallbladder.<br> 
Some urobilinogen exits in the urine.<br> 
Excess urobilinogen may indicate that the liver has problems dealing with the byproducts of red blood cell breakdown.<br> 
Liver problems may include: hepatitis, gallstones, haemolytic anemia, pernicious anemia, and even lead poisoning.<br>
4. Tests with multiple reagent strips<br>
 It is a firm plastic strip to which are affixed several separate reagent areas.<br>
 Sugar, serum albumin, urobilinogen and bilirubin are the four biochemical substances tested in a random urine sample.<br>
 Although the heat and acetic acid test detects the presence of proteins such as albumin, only a semi-quantitative test will be really useful.<br>
5. Bilirubin test<br>
 It is based on the coupling of bilirubin with diazotized dichloronaniline in a strongly acid medium.<br>
 The colour ranges through various shades of tan.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.5.6H">19.5.6</a> Tests for borax / turmeric adulteration of food<br>
Borax or boric acid adulteration<br>

The turmeric paper turns bright cherry-red colour<br>
Add a drop of ammonia solution to the coloured turmeric paper, which turns dark green to black to show the presence of boric acid in the meat.<br>
Turmeric adulteration<br>
Add borax to solution of food, e.g. ground rhubarb root or mustard  from (Sinapsis alba), to detect adulteration with turmeric and to improve the colour of the product.<br>
The addition of borax causes a deep brown colour to detect the adulteration.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.5.7H">19.5.7</a> Test for proteins<br>
 The test area of the reagent strip is impregnated with an indicator, tetrabromophenol blue, C19H6Br8O5S, buffered to pH 3.0.<br>
 At this pH it is yellow in the absence of protein.<br>
 Protein forms a complex with the dye turning the colour of the dye to green or blue-green.<br>
 The colour is compared with the colour chart provided, which indicates the approximate protein concentration.<br>
 It is based on the protein error of the pH indicator.<br>
 At a constant pH, the presence of protein leads to the development of any green colour.<br>
 Colours range from yellow for "negative" through yellow green and green to green blue for "positive" reactions.<br>
