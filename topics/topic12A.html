 Describe the colour and shape of different salt crystals.<br> 
<a name="12.10.2aH">Storm glass</a><br>
  The "storm glass" is a solution of salts that changes to form different types of crystals in different weather conditions, probably caused by changes in temperature.<br> 
 The liquid within the sealed glass container contains ethanol, potassium nitrate, ammonium chloride and camphor.<br> 
 It was invented by Captain Robert Fitzroy, founder of the UK Meteorological Office and formerly the captain of HMS Beagle.<br> 
 From Australian Geographic:<br>
During Charles Darwin's historic voyage in the Beagle, 27-12-1831 to 2-10-1836, Captain FitzRoy carefully documented how the storm glass would predict the weather:<br>
 If the liquid in the glass is clear, the weather will be bright and clear.<br> 
 If the liquid is cloudy, the weather will be cloudy as well, perhaps with precipitation.<br> 
 If there are small dots in the liquid, humid or foggy weather can be expected.<br> 
 A cloudy glass with small stars indicates thunderstorms.<br> 
 If the liquid contains small stars on sunny winter days, then snow is coming.<br> 
 If there are large flakes throughout the liquid, it will be overcast in temperate seasons or snowy in the winter.<br> 
 If there are crystals at the bottom, this indicates frost.<br> 
 If there are threads near the top, it will be windy.<br> 
 In 1859, violent storms struck the British Isles.<br> 
 In response, the British Crown distributed storm glasses, then known as "FitzRoy's storm barometers," to many small fishing communities around the British Isles that were to be consulted by ships at port before setting sail.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.10.3H">12.10.3</a> Hydrolysis of ammonium chloride, NH4Cl<br>
 Dilute ammonia solution is only slightly dissociated, because it is a very weak alkali.<br> 
 The ammonium ions react with hydroxyl ions to form undissociated dilute ammonia solution leaving excess of hydrogen ions.<br> 
 The solution of ammonium chloride has pH value of about 6.<br> 
 Experiment<br>
 Dissolve ammonium chloride in water.<br> 
 NH4Cl (aq) --> NH4<sup>+</sup> (aq) + Cl<sup>-</sup> (aq)<br>
 NH4<sup>+</sup> (aq) + OH<sup>-</sup> (aq) --> NH4OH (s)<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.10.4H">12.10.4</a> Hydrolysis of iron (III) chloride<br>
 Iron chloride exists as anhydrous iron (III) chloride (FeCl3), and hydrated Iron (III) chloride-6-water (FeCl3.6H2O).<br> 
 Iron (III) chloride is rapidly hydrolysed in moist air and is partially hydrolysed in solution.<br> 
 Hydrolysis can be suppressed by addition of HCl.<br> 
 Fe(OH)2, green, is oxidized to Fe(OH)3, brown, in moist air.<br> 
 Experiment<br>
 Dissolve iron (III) chloride in boiling water.<br> 
 Add drops of dilute ammonia solution.<br> 
 The reaction forms a red-brown precipitate of iron (III) hydroxide.<br> 
 FeCl3 (aq) + NH4OH (aq) --> Fe(OH)3 (s) + NH4Cl (aq)<br>
 Heat to evaporate some solution.<br> 
 The reaction forms a red-brown precipitate of iron (III) hydroxide.<br> 
 FeCl3 (aq) + 3H2O (l) --> Fe(OH)3 (s) + 3HCl (l)<br>
 Pour the clear saturated solution into hot water.<br> 
 The reaction forms a red precipitate of hydrated iron (III) oxide.<br> 
 2FeCl3 (aq) + 3H2O (l) --> Fe2O3 (s) + 6HCl (l)<br>
 Add drops of sodium hydroxide solution.<br> 
 The reaction forms a red-brown precipitate of iron (III) hydroxide.<br>

 Washing powders contain di-sodium tetraborate (III)-10-water (borax) + sodium carbonate and are alkaline in solution.<br> 
 Hydrolysis is a chemical reaction of a compound with water.<br> 
 Hydrolysis of salts is the reverse of neutralization.<br> 
 Salts of weak acids or weak bases hydrolyse when dissolved in water.<br> 
 Weak acids with weak alkalis dissociate very slightly.<br> 
 Solvation occurs when solvent molecules form bonds with a solute particle.<br> 
 Experiment<br>

 Some hydrogen ions react to form the weak acid carbonic acid leaving excess hydroxyl ions in the solution.<br> 
 The solution turns red litmus blue.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.10.7H">12.10.7</a> pH of salt solutions<br>
See: <a href="../commercial/Commercial3.html#pH">pH</a> (Commercial).<br> 
 In a "normal salt", the replaceable hydrogen atoms of an acid have been completely replaced by a metal, e.g. sodium chloride, NaCl.<br> 
 In an "acid salt", the replaceable hydrogen atoms of an acid have not all been replaced, e.g. potassium hydrogen sulfate, KHSO4.<br> 
 However, a "normal salt" is not necessarily a neutral salt, because hydrolysis may occur, e.g. sodium carbonate is alkaline in solution, but ammonium chloride is acidic in solution.<br> 
 (In most chemistry curricula nowadays, the term "normal" is no longer used!)<br>
 Experiments<br>
 1. Half fill seven test-tubes with water and add two drops of universal indicator.<br> 
 Add 1.25 mL of the following salts: sodium carbonate, sodium sulfite, sodium chloride, ammonium chloride, aluminium chloride, borax, iron (II) sulfate.<br> 
 Note the pH value according to the colour produced.<br> 
 2. Warm the solutions and note whether this increases the hydrolysis, in some cases producing greater divergence from neutrality.<br> 
 3. Add three drops of universal indicator to 5 mL of 0.2 M a salt solution<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.10.8H">12.10.8</a> Prepare zinc sulfate crystals, ZnSO4Â·7H2O<br>
 Add pieces of granulated zinc to sodium bisulfate, (sodium hydrogen sulfate, NaHSO4), in a test-tube, and heat.<br> 
 When there is no further reaction and all the blue colour has disappeared, filter the mixture.<br> 
 The filtrate is zinc sulfate solution.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.10.9H">12.10.9</a> Reactions of salts with water<br>
Water and salts do not usually react, but sometimes hydrolysis occurs and the solution becomes either acidic or alkaline.<br>
Dissolve a small amount of the following salts in demineralized water and test each solution with red and with blue litmus paper: sodium chloride, sodium carbonate, copper (II) sulfate, sodium acetate, iron chloride, copper (II) sulfate and iron chloride give acidic solutions.<br>
Sodium carbonate and sodium acetate give alkaline solutions.<br>
Sodium chloride solution is neither acidic nor alkaline.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.10.10H">12.10.10</a> Salt solutions with another salt<br>
 This is the only way to prepare an insoluble salt.<br> 
 In this type of reaction, the needed salt forms a precipitate.<br> 
 When solutions of two ionic substances are mixed and the ions of an insoluble salt are in this mixture, then a precipitate of the insoluble salt forms.<br> 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Experiments<br>
 1. Make dilute solutions of different salts in separate test-tubes, e.g. barium nitrate, silver nitrate and lead nitrate.<br> 
 To each add a small quantity of dilute hydrochloric acid from a dropping tube.<br> 
 Note the colour and appearance of any precipitate that forms.<br> 
 2. Repeat the procedure using 1. sodium chloride solution, 2. sodium sulfate solution, 3. dilute sulfuric acid.<br> 
 silver ions (aq) + chloride ions (aq) --> silver chloride (s) (Silver chloride is insoluble in water)<br>
 lead ions (aq) + chloride ions (aq) --> lead chloride (s) (Lead chloride is insoluble in water)<br>
 sodium nitrate (aq) + copper (II) sulfate (aq) --> sodium ions (aq) + nitrate ions (aq) + copper ions (aq) + sulfate ions (aq)<br>
 (No precipitate, because both sodium sulfate and copper nitrate are soluble in water.)<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.10.11H">12.10.11</a> Salts, acid salt, sodium chloride, "table salt"<br>
<a href="../Tests.html#3.71.1H">3.71.1</a> Solubility table and solubility rules<br>
 A salt is the product with water of the reaction of an acid with a base.<br> 
 A salt is a compound formed when the hydrogen ion of an acid is replaced by a metal ion or electropositive complex ion, e.g. NH4.<br> 
 An acid salt forms when an acid contains more than one replaceable hydrogen ion, e.g. H2SO4 and not all the hydrogen ions are replaced, e.g. NaH(SO4)2.<br> 
 Salts are usually crystalline and are composed of positive and negative ions.<br> 
 You can prepare insoluble salt precipitates from pairs of solutions of salts by using the solubility rules.<br> 
 Sodium chloride is an ionic solid.<br> 
 Crystals of sodium chloride contain Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> ions attracted to each other by strong ionic bonds in a crystal lattice.<br> 
 The crystals are hard and have high melting points and boiling points.<br> 
 When melted or in solution, sodium chloride conducts electricity, but the solid is a poor conductor of electricity.<br> 

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.10.12H">12.10.12</a> pH values of oxides<br>
See: <a href="../commercial/Commercial3.html#pH">pH</a> (Commercial).<br> 
 Add 3 drops of Universal Indicator to 2 CC of the following oxides and note the colour change, pH value and state whether the oxides are acid, alkali or neutral<br>
 1. 0.2 M Nitric acid (nitrogen oxide and water)<br>
 2. 0.2 M Sodium hydroxide (sodium oxide and water)<br>
 3. 0.2 M Potassium hydroxide (potassium oxide and water)<br>
 4. 0.2 M Phosphoric acid (phosphorus (V) oxide and water)<br>
 5. 0.2 M Calcium hydroxide (calcium oxide and water)<br>
 The soluble oxides of metals are alkaline, and the oxides of non-metals are acidic oxides.<br> 

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.11.1H"></a>12.11.1 Tests for acetates<br>
 1. Add to 5 drops of original solution drops of dilute HCl, or HNO3 if using a Pb salt.<br> 
 If effervescence occurs, pass the gas through limewater.<br> 
 A milky precipitate indicates CO3<sup>2-</sup>.<br> 
 If effervescence does not occur, heat the solution.<br> 
 The odour of vinegar indicates CH3COO<sup>-</sup>.<br> 
2. Neutralize with dilute nitric acid and ammonia, then add iron (III) chloride solution.<br> 
 A blood red colour, lost by adding hydrochloric acid, indicates an acetate.<br> 
 3. Add an equal volume of alcohol and then drops of concentrated sulfuric acid.<br> 
 Heat gently and smell the vapour.<br> 
 The fruity smell of ethyl acetate indicates the presence of an acetate.<br> 
 CH3COONa + C2H5OH + H2SO4 --> CH3COOC2H5 + NaHSO4 + H2O.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.11.2H">12.11.2</a> Tests for acid radicals in solution<br>
 Before testing a solution for acidic radicals remove heavy metals that may interfere with the tests, leaving only sodium, potassium or ammonium in solution.<br>
 For example, to test for a sulfate radical in solution, add dilute hydrochloric acid and barium chloride solution.<br> 
 A white precipitate of barium sulfate indicates the presence of a sulfate.<br> 
 Ba<sup>2+</sup> + SO4<sup>2-</sup> --> BaSO4 (s).<br>
 However, if the solution already contains the silver ion, the white precipitate is silver chloride.<br> 
 Ag<sup>+</sup> + Cl<sup>-</sup> --> AgCl (s).<br> 
Experiment<br>
 Boil 1 g of the finely divided unknown solid with sodium carbonate solution to precipitate heavy metals as carbonates, or as hydroxides by hydrolysis.<br> 
 Filter off the precipitates.<br> 
 Copper may rarely form a soluble double carbonate.<br> 
 The acidic radicals, originally combined with the heavy metals, are now in the filtrate as the sodium salts if double decomposition has occurred, e.g. a mixture containing barium chloride and calcium nitrate:<br>
 BaCl2 + Na2CO3 --> BaCO3 (precipitate) + 2NaCl (solution)<br>
 Ca(NO3)2 + Na2CO3 --> CaCO3 (precipitate) + 2NaNO3 (solution)<br>
 The filtrate is alkaline with excess sodium carbonate and now must be made acidic,<br>
For example, for barium chloride use hydrochloric acid, for silver nitrate use nitric acid - so you do not add the radical you are testing for.<br> 
 If the solutions are not made acid, the sodium carbonate precipitates the metal of the testing reagent as a heavy metal carbonate.<br>

 Most chromates are only slightly soluble or insoluble so the tests are mainly for sodium, potassium or ammonium chromate (VI) ions.<br> 
 A solution with a bright yellow colour indicates that it is worth testing for chromate (VI) ions.<br> 
 Oxidation reactions involve the reduction of solutions of chromate or dichromate ions that cause colour changes from yellow or orange to pale green or colourless solutions.<br> 
 The reactions with the formation of an insoluble metal chromate give brightly coloured precipitates.<br> 
 Do not attempt to isolate these precipitates, because they are carcinogenic.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.12.1H">12.12.1</a> Prepare buffer solutions<br>
 1. A buffer solution is a mixture of substances that tend to hinder large changes in acid or basic properties of a solution.<br> 
 The term is used in a more general sense outside chemistry.<br> 
 The pH of a buffer solution is not greatly changed by the addition of an acid or an alkali.<br> 
 Most buffer solutions are a mixture of a weak acid or base with one of its salts.<br> 
 In natural body fluids, the buffers include H2CO3 with HCO3<sup>-</sup>.<br> 
 2. Buffers based on weak acids work, because the dissociation of a weak acid is an equilibrium reaction.<br> 
 If a weak acid, HA, dissociates in solution as follows:<br>
 HA (aq) &lt;==&gt; H<sup>+</sup> (aq) + A<sup>-</sup> (aq), both [H<sup>+</sup> (aq)] and [A<sup>-</sup> (aq)] are small, because HA is a weak acid<br>
 If OH- ions are added, the OH- ions react with H+ to form water to disturb the equilibrium to cause more HA to dissociate until the original pH value is restored.<br> 
 If soluble salt, Na<sup>+</sup>A<sup>-</sup>, is added to increase the A<sup>-</sup>, more H<sup>+</sup> will be removed.<br> 
 3. The weak acid in a buffer solution is a source of H<sup>+</sup> to react with added OH<sup>-</sup>, and the salt component reacts with added H<sup>+</sup>.<br> 
 Acidic buffer, e.g. sodium hydrogencarbonate with carbonic acid solutions, the salt of the weak acid is completely dissociated into ions, but the weak acid is only partly dissociated.<br> 
 Basic buffer, e.g. ammonium chloride in ammonia solutions.<br>
 The pH value of buffer solutions changes very little when acids or alkalis are added or when diluted with water.<br> 
 4. Although the salts of weak acids are completely dissociated into ions, weak acids do not dissociate completely.<br> 
 A buffer solution contains a weak acid and the salt of the weak acid, e.g. H2CO3 / HCO3<sup>-</sup> (carbonic acid / sodium hydrogencarbonate).<br> 
 By mixing an acid with its conjugate base, definite hydrogen ion concentrations, within a certain range depending on the dissociation constant of the acid, are obtainable.<br> 
 Such solutions have the advantage that evaporation will not affect the value of (H<sup>+</sup>), because the ratio (acid) / (base) remains constant.<br> 
 5. Contamination by small quantities of acidic or basic impurities will not affect the pH.<br> 
 If an acid is added to a buffer solution, the H<sup>+</sup> added reacts with the HCO3<sup>-</sup>.<br> 
 If a base is added to a buffer solution, the OH<sup>-</sup> reacts with the undissociated H2CO3 to form the salt and water.<br> 
 <hr width="100%" size="2">Examples of buffer solutions:<br>
 1. Hydrochloric acid with ammonia in excess, HCl with NH3 in excess, i.e. strong acid with weak base in excess.<br> 
 2. Hydrochloric acid with sodium acetate in excess, HCl with CH3COONa in excess, i.e. base of a weak acid with strong acid.<br> 
 3. Sodium hydroxide with acetic acid in excess, NaOH with CH3COOH in excess, i.e. strong base with weak acid in excess.<br> 
 4. Sodium acetate with acetic acid, CH3COONa with CH3COOH, i.e. base of a weak acid with weak acid.<br> 
 5. Sodium hydroxide with ammonium chloride in excess, NaOH with NH4Cl in excess.<br> 
 6. Ammonium chloride with ammonia, NH4Cl with NH3.<br>

 If add H<sup>+</sup>: NH3 (aq) + H<sup>+</sup> (aq) --> NH4<sup>+</sup> (aq)<br>
 7. Blood is buffered to pH 7.4, mainly from the following equation:<br>
 H<sup>+</sup> (aq) + HCO3<sup>-</sup> (aq) &lt;=&gt; CO2 (aq) + H2O (l)<br>

 Titrate the mixture with hydrochloric acid.<br> 
 Note the rapid change of colour from blue-green at pH about 8.5 to orange-red at pH about 4.<br> 
 When a strong alkali is titrated against a strong acid, the indicator indicates the equivalence point with negligible error.<br> 
 Repeat the experiment with a low pH indicator, e.g. methyl orange, and a high pH indicator, e.g. phenolphthalein, and note the slight difference.<br> 
 2. Add two drops of universal indicator to 10 mL of sodium hydroxide solution and titrate the mixture with acetic acid.<br> 
 Note that when the equivalence point is reached, the pH is about 8.5.<br> 
 Note also the considerable excess of acid necessary to approach the orange colour of pH 4, showing that only a high pH indicator is efficient in the titration of a strong alkali with a weak acid.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.12.3H">12.12.3</a> Prepare a buffer salt with sodium acetate, universal indicator<br>
 A buffer salt is essentially a highly ionized salt of a weak acid.<br> 
 1. Add two drops of universal indicator to 10 mL of 0.1 M sodium hydroxide solution.<br> 
 Titrate the mixture with 0.1 M hydrochloric acid.<br> 
 Note the colour changes that indicate the rapid change of pH about the equivalence point.<br> 
 2. Add 5 g of sodium acetate to 10 mL of 0.1 M sodium hydroxide solution, then two drops of indicator.<br> 
 Titrate the mixture with 0.1 M hydrochloric acid.<br> 
 Note hydrogen ions are added, but the green colour of the indicator persists because the pH remains constant over a long period of addition of hydrogen ions.<br> 
 The buffer salt, sodium acetate, is highly ionized and gives acetate ions.<br> 
 The hydrogen ions from the hydrochloric acid form molecular acetic acid instead of increasing the hydrogen ion concentration in the solution.<br> 
 NaAc --> Na<sup>+</sup> + Ac<sup>-</sup><br>
 H<sup>+</sup> + Ac<sup>-</sup> --> HAc<br>
 When a large excess of hydrogen ions is added, the pH of the solution decreases.<br> 
 Adding a strong alkali to a highly ionized salt of a weak base does not at first increase the pH of the mixture.<br> 
 Ammonium chloride solution gives ammonium ions that react with the added hydroxide ions of a strong alkali to form molecular "ammonium hydroxide".<br> 
 (Not "ammonium hydroxide, NH4OH".<br> 
 Ammonia solution is shown as NH3 (aq), because "NH4<sup>+</sup>" ions and "OH<sup>-</sup>" ions can be detected, but "NH4OH" cannot be detected.)<br>
