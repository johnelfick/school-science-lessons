Lead poisoning kills many people every year from long-term effects such as kidney failure, high blood pressure,  heart disease, stroke and brain damage.<br>
Lead type (lead, tin, antimony alloy), invented by Johannes Gutenberg (1395-1468, Germany), first printed Bible using moveable lead  type, lead shot,<br> 
fishing sinkers, roof guttering, foil, powder, filings, strip, is a soft, dense, and unreactive metal, available as lead foil, powder and lead shot<br>
It is extracted from the ore galena (PbS), used in fishing sinkers, solder, lead glazes and X-ray protective shields<br>
It holds the pieces of glass together in stained glass windows, used in bullets, lead shot, building construction, lead cell accumulators,  pewter, bearings and alloys.<br>
Formerly, ladies used lead carbonate to whiten their laces and some may have died from such use.<br>
Lead reacts with concentrated oxidizing acids, HNO3 or H2SO4 to produce high oxidation number ions, and sulfur dioxide.<br> SO2 or nitrogen dioxide, NO2.<br>
Lead has no reaction with dilute HCl or H2SO4or with water.<br>
Heated lead powder forms lead oxide.<br>
 Inorganic Pb2+is an accumulated poison and can replace calcium in bone.<br>
 A "lead pencil" contains graphite, not lead.<br>
 Lead is a metal with a silvery appearance that is resistant to attack by acids, because of the formation of a protective oxidized layer on its surface.<br>
 The metal melts at low temperature and is a good conductor of electricity, so it is used in solders.<br>
 The vapours of molten lead are extremely toxic and the effect of inhaling them is cumulative.<br>
 Lead salts are toxic by inhalation and can be absorbed through the skin, so should be handled with great care.<br>
 Wash laboratory areas where lead salts have been used with a dilute detergent solution to prevent exposure to any residual dust containing lead.<br>
 Do not heat lead oxide on a charcoal block.<br>
 Lead is used in the production of batteries, ammunition, metal products (solder and pipes), and devices to shield X-rays.<br>
 Lead was present in petroleum, paints and ceramic products, caulking and pipe solder.<br>
 Hhowever, because of health concerns, it is now prohibited to include lead in these products.<br>
 Water pipes in some older buildings may contain lead solder.<br>

Ingestion and skin absorption of lead caused "lead poisoning", especially in young children sucking lead paint peeling off old walls.<br>
Lead-based paints deteriorate leaving lead in the dust that can be inhaled.<br>
Children can be exposed by eating lead-based paint chips, chewing on objects painted with lead-based paint, or swallowing house dust or soil that contains lead.<br>

"Lead in Paint" from the World Health Organization<br>
"No level of exposure to lead is considered safe.<br>
The poisonous properties: of lead have been recognized since ancient times, and today it is recognized as one of the twenty leading risk factors contributing to the global burden of disease.<br>
Eliminating lead exposure from petrol has been one of the most significant environment health improvements in recent times.<br>
Products containing lead are still widely made and sold across much of the developing world.<br>
It is very likely that most of the world's people live in countries where exposure to high lead levels in paint is frequent.<br>
Lead in paint is the second largest source of exposure to lead following exposure from petrol.<br>
Paint containing lead is used in infrastructure like bridges, industry (car parts) and for marine uses, and also domestically.<br>
The evidence of neurological damage, especially to children (whose intelligence can be impaired) and to workers in the lead industry is beyond doubt.<br>
Adults can suffer renal and cardiovascular damage.<br>
Some studies suggest a link to behavioural problems as well.<br>
Lead damage is irreversible, and its effects appear to persist into adolescence and adulthood.<br>
House dust is the commonest way in which children are harmed by lead in paint.<br>
The lead remains a risk for many years after the paint has been used.".<br>

This "leaded petrol" is no longer made or used in Australia and other countries, because the compound causes lead poisoning and environmental pollution, so is replaced by "unleaded petrol" that contains additional hydrocarbons to improve its octane rating, e.g. methanol and methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE).<br>

LPG, LP Gas, Liquefied Petroleum gas, is a clean burning fuel and is stored in gas cylinders as bottled gas.<br>
LPG is a simple asphyxiant.<br>
LPG consists of propane (about 95%), together with varying proportions of butane, propylene and butylene.<br>
A rank smelling compound, odorant, e.g. ethyl mercaptan, is added so that the presence of the gas can be easily detected.<br>
Incomplete combustion forms carbon monoxide.<br>
Do not search for a gas leak with a lighted match or lighted taper. but use a soap solution.<br>

Weigh out pieces of lead and tin to make four alloys so that the percentage of tin by weight is 20% tin, 40% tin, 60% tin and 80% tin.<br>
Put each mixture of lead and tin in a crucible or Pyrex test-tube.<br>
Cover each mixture with powdered charcoal to prevent oxidation of the metals, then heat with a Bunsen burner until they melt.<br>
Stir the melt with a wood splint to help the metals dissolve.<br>

Drill holes through the four corners of the metal plate.<br>
Thread wire through the four holes and suspend the metal plate horizontally.<br>
Pour a few globules of four alloys and the two pure metals into separate porcelain bowls.<br>
Be careful! Put one pellet of each alloy or metal into a depression on the metal plate.<br>
Heat the middle of the metal plate with a Bunsen burner.<br>
Touch the pellets with a wood splint to check when they melt.<br>
When all the pellets are all molten, use the wooden splint to remove excess molten metal from bigger pellets so that they are all the same size.<br>
Remove the Bunsen burner flame, leave the metal plate to cool and note the time to form crystals.<br>
Make a table of time to crystallize and plot the results on graph paper.<br>
Pure lead solidifies first, then 20% tin, then 40% tin, then 60% tin.<br>
The alloy that takes the longest time to solidify has the lowest melting point.<br>

 Natural rubber, latex, C5H8)n, [n = 4, 0005, 000] (<i>Hevea brasiliensis</i>), and (<i>Ficus elastica</i>)<br>
Polyisoprene, elastomer, diene polymer, natural rubber is mainly cis-1,4-polyisprene, from <i>Hevea brasiliensis</i>, main monomer isoprene, 
 -CH2=C(CH3)CH=CH2-, 2-methyl-1,3-butadiene, also made synthetically, cis polyisoprene, isoprene rubber<br>
Gutta-percha is mainly trans-1,4-polyisprene<br>
1. Natural polymers occur as brittle glassy gums and resins in plants, e.g. conifers, and as polysaccharides, e.g. starch.<br>
Natural rubber, para rubber, hevea rubber obtained from the milky latex sap of <i>Hevea braziliensis</i>, Euphorbiaceae, contains polyterpenes with linked isoprene units CH2=C(CH3)CH=CH2, [cis-1,4-polyisoprene], in which all the -CH=CH-= groups are cis.<br>
2. The polymer chains in natural rubber are elastic in the sense that the chains can be unravelled without coming apart, i.e. the rubber can stretch.<br>
Elasticity was improved by cross-linking with sulfur, using the Goodyear process to produce vulcanized rubber.<br>
Stretching aligns the random chains, and temporarily crystallizes and toughens rubber, so that rubber tyres do not form cracks.<br>
Natural rubber is not very elastic in the Hooke's law sense of stress being proportional to strain.<br>
The transisoprene polymer, trans-1,4-polyisoprene, occurs in the latex of <i>Palaquium oblongifolium</i>, Sapotaceae family, the same chemical as natural rubber, polyisoprene, but with trans, not cis, bonding.<br>
 3. Test for strength of cross-linkages, add toluene then measure the increase in volume<br>
Rubber bands are made mostly of natural rubber cured by heat.<br>
Petrol can dissolve the cross-linkages between the polyisoprene molecules to allow water molecules to move in between them and swell the rubber band.<br>
4. Hard rubber was made by Charles Goodyear and shown at the 1851 exhibition at Crystal Palace, London.<br>
During the vulcanization process, 30-40% sulfur is added to the natural rubber to form a compound with high dielectric power, high resistance to chemical products, hardness and rigidity up to 50C, and a bright shiny appearance.<br>
It is processed with extruders then worked on machines or compression moulds to make battery separators, telephone receivers, tyres.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="23.6.3H">23.6.3</a> Negative thermal expansion (NTE) of rubber, entropy<br>
Negative thermal expansion (NTE) materials contract on heating within certain temperature ranges.<br>
They are not called "thermal contraction" materials.<br>
A rubber band contracts on heating, because when long polymer chains in rubber absorb energy, adopt a more contorted configuration, reducing the volume.<br> 
A cooled rubber band, becomes stretchier and expands slightly, because the molecules become more organized into a more efficient stretching shape.<br>
A common explanation of this phenomenon is that the arrangement of long polymer chains in rubber is like a ball of mixed up threads of string.<br>
By grabbing hold of each end of the tangle and pulling it in opposite directions, the threads of string become more horizontal as the ball of string is elongated.<br>
So the arrangement of threads becomes more ordered and the entropy of the system becomes lower.<br>
Reduced entropy, more orderly alignment of molecules, causes the rubber band to lose heat.<br>
A stretched rubber band feels hotter as it expands with heat lost in an exothermic process.<br>
A contracting rubber band feels cooler with heat gained in an endothermic process.<br>
The particles making up rubber in its natural state are more disordered than when the rubber is stretched and is under tension.<br>
When tension is removed the rubber contracts back with the particles returning to their initial disordered state.<br>
Entropy is a measure of the amount of disorder in a system, so the entropy of a rubber band increases when it changes from a stretched state to a natural state.<br>
The change of entropy of a system in a reversible process = the amount of heat absorbed or emitted / absolute temperature of the system.<br>

See diagram: <a href="../images/23.6.4.jpg"> 23.6.4</a> Test heated rubber bands<br>
1. To demonstrate the effect of heating rubber bands, stretch a rubber band around a wooden box.<br>
Cut out an arrow shape from a piece of cardboard.<br>
Mount the arrow on a pin and then push the pin under the middle of the elastic band.<br>
If the elastic band is heated at the left of the pin, it contracts, pulling the pin towards it and the point of the arrow moves to the right.<br>
2. Rubber band heat engine is a bicycle wheel with rubber bands instead of spokes.<br>
Set up the bicycle wheel vertically.<br>
Rubber contracts on heating so a lamp or a hair dryer placed on one side of the wheel shift the centre of gravity, resulting in rotation.<br>
Cooler rubber spokes move into the irradiated region to repeat the process.<br>
To achieve a smoother rotation the wheel is balanced using small pieces of Plasticine placed around the rim.<br>
3. To make more space in a freezer, you might collect scattered items, e.g. ice lollies, and put an elastic band around them.<br>
However, after some time the originally stretched elastic band become 
loose and slacker, than when first applied to the ice lollies at room temperature.<br>
4. To observe the thermal properties of rubber, hang a 1 kg mass from four rubber bands, so it touches the table.<br>
Heat with a radiant heater for 20 seconds and the mass will lift.<br>
Enclose a rubber tube in a copper cylinder and heat with a Bunsen burner.<br>
The rubber tubing contracts as it is heated.<br>
Stretch and unstretch rubber bands on the lips to feel the changes in temperature.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="23.6.5H">23.6.5</a> Stretch rubber bands<br>
Hooke's law does not apply to polymers or rubber.<br>
1. Stretch a thick rubber bandit (&gt; 0.5 cm wide) quickly against the forehead, lips, or wrist and note the increase in temperature.<br>
Hold it stretched, allow it to cool back to room temperature.<br>
Then let it suddenly contract against the lips to its original length and note the temperature drop.<br>
2. Use a hair dryer to heat a stretched rubber band, e.g. 1 cm wide, with a weight on the end, e.g. 2 kg.<br>
3. Stretch a wide rubber band between the index finger of your two hands.<br>
Let the rubber band touch the lips.<br>
Stretch the rubber band (not so far that it breaks!) then slowly release the tension.<br>
Feel heat in your lips when the rubber band stretches, because of friction between the rubber molecules.<br>
The stretched rubber band feels cooler when the tension is released.<br>
4. Hold each end of the rubber band with the fingers of your hands, press your lips firmly to the middle of the rubber band, and maintain contact as you quickly stretch the rubber band in opposite directions outward.<br>
Your lips you will feel a sudden heat from the rubber band.<br>
5. Suspend a 100 g weight from a rubber band attached to a clamp stand.<br>
Adjust the height of the 100 g weight until it just touches the table.<br>
Use a vertical ruler to measure the length of the suspended rubber band.<br>
Bring a heat source, e.g. a lighted match or hair dryer close to the middle of the stretched rubber band.<br>
Note that the heated rubber band contracts.<br>

Linoleic acid, C18H32O2, CH3(CH2)4CH=CHCH2CH=CH(CH2)7COOH, polyunsaturated omega-6 fatty acid, has cis and trans forms.<br>
In the cis configuration, the four hydrogen atoms adjacent to the double bonds occur on the same side of the carbon axis.<br>
In the trans configuration, the four hydrogen atoms adjacent to the double bonds occur on alternate sides of the main carbon axis, 2 on one side and 2 on the other.<br>
The more stable trans configuration may be produced from the cis configuration during hydrogenation of polyunsaturated vegetable oils to improve their texture.<br>
Trans fatty acids tend to raise the level of low density lipoproteins (bad LDLs) and lower the level of high density lipoproteins, (good HDLs)<br>
These actions may result in changes in cholesterol levels that may increase the risk of the heart disease atherosclerosis.<br>
Mono-unsaturated, unhydrogenated oils, e.g. olive oil, are preferable to the trans fatty acids in French fries, chips, and doughnuts.<br>
The first double bond is on carbon #6, counting from left to right so this is an omega-6 fatty acid, typical of the unsaturated fatty acids in plant oils and seeds.<br>
However, fish oils contain omega-3 fatty acids, i.e. the first double bond in on carbon #3.<br>
