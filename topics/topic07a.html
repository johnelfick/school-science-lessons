<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.4.1H">7.4.1</a> Silicon compounds, glass<br>
 Silicon is a metalloid, because it has physical properties of metals and chemical properties of non-metals.<br>
 Silicon is a semiconductor.<br>
 Silicon does not exist free in nature, but occurs mainly as silicon (IV) oxide (SiO2), in silica sand, sandstone, clay, quartz and opal.<br>
 Silicates occur in most rocks and glass.<br>
 Portland cement is a mixture of calcium and aluminium silicates.<br>
 In the silicone oils and greases, the silicon atoms form polymers containing a chain of silicon and oxygen atoms with carbon and hydrogen atoms attached to the chain.<br>
 Silicones repel water.<br>
 Silica glass, an amorphous solid, is more like a "super cooled liquid" than a crystal, because, unlike crystalline substances, it does not have a sharp melting point.<br>
 However, some chemists say that glass is a disordered solid not a supercooled liquid.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.4.2H">7.4.2</a> Prepare silica gel<br>
 Some gels can lose water by heating to leave a rigid gel.<br>
 Silica gel is an amorphous form of hydrated silica, very hygroscopic, and is used to protect delicate machinery from rusting.<br>
Experiments<br>
1. Prepare silica gel
Add sodium silicate to water.<br>
Add drops of phenolphthalein.<br>
Add 3 M hydrochloric acid until the red colour disappears.<br>
The solution sets as a gel.<br>
Heat the gel to remove moisture.<br>
The gel can absorb water again.<br>
2.  Prepare silicate gardens<br>
Mix one part of sodium silicate (IV), (Na2SiO3), with four parts of water to make water glass.<br>
Gently add crystals of salts to the solution without mixing to make chemical "flowers" grow:<br>
 * Chlorides: Co, Fe, Cu, Ni and Pb,<br>
 * Sulfates: Al, Fe, Cu, and Ni,<br>
 * Nitrates: Co, Fe, Cu and Ni.<br>
Put sand 1 cm deep in a 500 mL jar.<br>
Make a 1: 1 mixture of sodium silicate and water (water glass), and pour it onto the sand to almost fill the jar.<br>
Leave the jar to stand undisturbed for a day.<br>
Drop in crystals of metal salts, e.g. metal hydroxides, iron sulfate, copper (II) sulfate, alum, Epsom salts.<br>
Observe crystals forming "shoots".<br>
Some shoots are directed up by small bubbles.<br>
The metal hydroxide skin formed around the crystal is permeable only to water and not the salt.<br>
The water diffuses in to balance the concentrations each side of the skin until the skin bursts the skin then forms again further from the crystal.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.4.4H">7.4.4</a> Prepare silicon glass<br>
 1. Pick up sodium carbonate in a nichrome wire loop.<br>
 Dip the loop into powdered silica and heat over a burner to form a transparent bead of glass.<br>
 2. Prepare silicon glass in a furnace<br>
 Prepare glass in a crucible by heating a glass mixture in a furnace or over a Meker burner with a hot wide flame.<br>
 Glass mixture A: 17 g clean sand, 4.4 g sodium carbonate, 5.2 g disodium tetraborate (III)-10-water (borax).<br>
 Glass mixture B: 6 g clean sand, 2 g sodium carbonate, 1 g calcium carbonate.<br>
 3. Prepare coloured glass<br>
 Add a metal oxide to the glass mixture.<br>
 Heat the end of a glass rod to red heat.<br>
 Dip it into a powdered metallic oxide and heat until the oxide fuses into the glass.<br>
 4. Use salts to colour glass:<br>
 * For amethyst, use manganese (IV) oxide.<br>
 * For green, use black copper (II) oxide.<br>
 * For ruby, use red copper (I) oxide.<br>
 * For white, use tin oxide.<br>
 5. Mix a little silica with an equal quantity of calcium carbonate and about twice as much anhydrous sodium carbonate.<br>
 Grind them to a powder in a mortar with a pestle.<br>
 Make a loop in a platinum wire.<br>
 Heat the loop and place it in the mixture.<br>
 Reheat the wire with the adhering mixture until the mixture fuses, then cool it.<br>
 6. Describe the bead.<br>
 Hit it with a hammer to se if it is t brittle,<br>
 Does it dissolve in water?<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.4.5H">7.4.5</a> Prepare silly putty<br>
 Dilatant compound, "Silly Putty", silicone, (toy product)<br>
 Silly putty, silicone, bouncing putty (Dow Corning 3179 dilatant compound), "Tricky Putty", (toy product)<br>
 Super ball, (toy product), is made from polybutadiene with small amounts of sulfur to reinforce the material and serve as a vulcanizing agent.<br>
The ball is moulded under very high pressure and temperature and is said to have a 92% resiliency, about three times the resiliency of a tennis ball.<br>
 It can continue to bounce for about a minute after being dropped from a short height.<br>
 The silicone polymer in silly putty, polyborosiloxane, have covalent bonds within the molecules, but hydrogen bonds between the molecules.<br>
 The hydrogen bonds are easily broken.<br>
 A silicone is chains of (OH-Si-O-Si-O-Si-OH), with two methyl groups, CH 3 on each of the Si atoms.<br>
 However, in "Silly putty", boron atoms that can cross link weakly with oxygen atoms in other chains replace some of the silicon atoms.<br>
 Experiments<br>
 1. Mix 55% Elmer's glue solution and 16% sodium borate in a 4: 1 ratio.<br>
 Ingredients: 65% dimethyl siloxane, hydroxy terminated, polymers with boric acid, 17% silica, quartz crystalline, 9% thixotrol ST, 4% polydimethylsiloxane,<br>
1% decamethyl cyclopentasiloxane, 1% glycerine, 1% titanium dioxide.<br>
 2. Apply small amounts of stress are slowly to the putty only a few bonds are broken and the putty "flows" and stretches a great distance.<br>
 Apply larger amounts of stress quickly, many hydrogen bonds are broken, and the putty breaks or tears.<br>
 Roll it into a ball that you can bounce.<br>
 Press it onto a pencil drawing so that it lifts off the pencil marks so you can see the drawing on the surface of the silly putty.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.4.6H">7.4.6</a> Silicon tetrachloride with water<br>
 Silicon tetrachloride, a chlorosilane, is an epoxy resin hardener.<br>
 Highly toxic by all routes, with irritating fumes.<br>
 Stoppers of glass reagent bottles containing it may stick and the bottles may explode, so use very small containers.<br>
 It reacts vigorously with sodium and other reactive metals.<br>
 Silicon tetrachloride reacts vigorously with water to form insoluble silicon dioxide and an acidic hydrogen chloride solution.<br>
The solution gives off fumes of hydrogen chloride and dissociates to form hydrochloric acid solution.<br>
 SiCl 4 (s) + 2H2O (l) --> SiO2 (s) + 4HCl (aq)<br>
 HCl (aq) --> H + (aq) + Cl - (aq).<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.4.7H">7.4.7</a> Silicone rubber<br>
 Silicone rubbers, e.g. PVMQ. a low-temperature resistant rubber cross-linked with vinyl groups, and used for gaskets, because it is temperature resistant.<br>
 Polysiloxanes, [repeat unit: -Si(RR ' )O-, where R = organic group, e.g. methyl], are also used for aquarium seals and building seals.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.4.8H">7.4.8</a> Soda-lime glass<br>
 Main types of glass<br>
1. Soda-lime glass<br>
 Round glass jars may contain: SiO2, CaO, K2O, MgO, TiO2<br>
 Flat window glass may contain: SiO2, CaO, Al2O3, TiO2<br>
 2. Borosilicate glass, Pyrex<br>
Addition of borate allows the formation of a glass that melts at a lower temperate than silica, and expands less on heating than soda glass.<br>
Also, it is more plastic over a wider temperature range, e.g. Pyrex and glass wool.<br>
So borosilicate glass has a very low coefficient of thermal expansion and a softening temperature above 800 oC.<br>
The composition may be 70% silica, 10% boron oxide and some sodium, potassium and calcium oxides.<br>
The chemical composition of the Pyrex used in laboratory glassware may be different from the Pyrex used in kitchenware.<br>
Pyrex is sold as, Mixing bowls, Pyrex, glass 1 litre, Casserole dish, freezer and dishwasher safe, 2 litre.<br>
 3. Fused quartz glass may contain: SiO2, used in some camera lenses.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.4.9H">7.4.9</a> Water glass<br>
1. Water glass is a colloidal solution of sodium or potassium silicate in water that solidifies on exposure to the air.<br>
 It is used in chemical gardens, egg preserving, paper sizing, fire resistant paint and fresco painting.<br>
 Sodium carbonate is heated with sand to produce sodium silicate, the water soluble water glass used is an inorganic builder in detergents, and for fireproofing.<br>
 Na2CO3 (s) + SiO2 (s) --> Na2SiO3 + CO (g)<br>
 Na2CO3 + SiO2 --> Na2O∙SiO2 + CO2<br>
 sodium carbonate + silicon dioxide --> sodium silicate (water glass) + carbon dioxide<br>
Water glass is an aqueous solution of potassium silicate or sodium silicate, which solidifies in the air and seals the pores in the egg shell to preserve the eggs.<br>
Commercial water glass is sold both as thick syrup liquid and as a powder.
Experiment<br>
Dissolve 1 part of water glass in 10 parts of boiled water.<br>
Pour the solution over the eggs packed in a suitable container and store them in a cool place.<br>
Do not wash the eggs before preserving them, because this removes the natural mucilaginous coating on the outside of the shell.<br>
To prevent the shells of eggs preserved in water glass from cracking when boiled, puncture the blunt end of the egg with a pin before putting it into the water.<br>
 2. When sodium oxide Na2O 15%, silicon dioxide SiO2 70%, and calcium oxide CaO 10% are heated together up to 1000 oC, insoluble silica glass forms.<br>
 All the crystalline order of the added minerals has been lost.<br>
 In silica glass, (soda lime silica glass, crown glass), each silicon atom is surrounded by four oxygen atoms as a tetrahedron, each linked to other tetrahedra.<br>
 When ionic oxides are added in the glass making melt they get between the Si-O-Si bridges and weaken it.<br>
For example: | transition temperatures silica glass Tg = about 1200 oC | Pyrex Tg = 550 oC | window glass Tg = 550 oC |.<br>
 3. The glass in high quality wine glasses (lead crystal), contains lead, which gives the glass a ringing sound, higher refractive index and more brilliance.<br>
 Cobalt gives blue glass, chromium gives green glass, and copper gives red or blue-green glass.<br>
 Boron oxide, B2O3, gives shockproof borosilicate glass, "Pyrex", that is resistant to all chemicals except hydrofluoric acid, HF.<br>
 Flint glass, lead glass, has no colour unlike crown glass that has a slight green to yellow colour due to iron impurity.<br>
 4. The 2 distinct constituents of glass are as follows:<br>
 4.1 The network former, i.e. the non-metal as an oxide is usually silicon, but it can be boron, aluminium, or phosphorus.<br>
 4.2 The network modifiers, e.g. sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium.<br>
 Glass may crystallize over a period of many years and then become more brittle, but some glass has remained uncrystallized for 4000 years in Egypt.<br>
 Sodium sesquicarbonate Na2CO3.NaHCO3.H2O occurs as a mineral.<br>
 4.3 A famous urban legend: glass in panes of old cathedrals and very old buildings is thicker at the bottom, because the glass has "flowed" down over along periods.<br>
 The most likely explanation is that at a time when the thickness of panes of glass varied at that stage of technology, glaziers always inserted the thicker sides down.<br>
 5. Collect drinking glasses, including wine glasses, of roughly the same size.<br>
 Strike each glass and listen to the ring to identify the existence of modifiers in the glass.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.5.1H">7.5.1</a> Emulsions<br>
 An emulsion is liquid dispersed in another liquid, e.g. mayonnaise, cream, milk.<br>
 An emulsion is the suspension of one liquid as fine droplets in another with which it does not mix.<br>
 Emulsions are colloidal systems with both the dispersed phase and the continuous phase are liquids, e.g. oil in water.<br>
 The droplets of a liquid remain suspended in another liquid.<br>
 Emulsions may be cloudy or opaque.<br>
 Emulsions are like suspensions, because they settle on standing.<br>
 A solid emulsion is a liquid dispersed in another solid, e.g. butter.<br>
Emulsions: milk, mayonnaise, ice cream, kerosene in water, suntan lotion, hand cream, photography emulsions, butter (water in oil), cream (oil in water),</td>
Emulsions: margerine, milk, mayonnaise, ice cream, kerosene in water, suntan lotion, hand cream, butter (water in oil), cream (oil in water)<br>
 Emulsion: Continuous phase / outer phase, continuous "outside" liquid around second liquid having discontinuous droplets.<br>
 Emulsifying agents<br>
 Emulsifying agents are used to keep the phases dispersed so that the droplets remain suspended and the emulsion remains stabilized.<br>
 When you shake two immiscible liquids, droplets of one liquid are dispersed in the other.<br>
 In temporary emulsions, e.g. kerosene in water or oil in water, there is no attraction between the two liquids.<br>
 The two phases will disperse in each other if shaken together, but will separate on standing.<br>
 However, by adding an emulsifying agent, e.g. soap, the two liquids, kerosene and water, will remain dispersed within each other.<br>
 
 <hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.5.2H">7.5.2</a> Emulsions with a microscope<br>
 Put a blob of an emulsion on the end of a microscope slide.<br>
 Put a drop of paraffin oil on one side of the blob and put a drop of water on the other side.<br>
 Stir a little of the emulsion into each liquid.<br>
 Smooth mixing occurs only when the liquid forms the continuous phase.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.5.3H">7.5.3</a> Bile salts as an emulsifying agent<br>
 The liver secretes bile that contains bile salts, sodium salts of the hydroxy steroid bile acids, e.g. taurocholic acid and glycocholic acid.<br>
 Bile salts are emulsifying agents and reducers of surface tension.<br>
They allow fat particles to remain suspended long enough for enzymes to digest them before absorption into the bloodstream.<br>
 Bile salts are sold as sodium tauroglycocholate.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.5.4H">7.5.4</a> Prepare face cream emulsion<br>
<a href="../images/16.2.2ch.gif">See diagram 16.2.2</a> : Emulsifiers used in cosmetics<br>
 Heat disodium tetraborate (III) in water until dissolved.<br>
 Heat a mixture of medicinal paraffin (propan-2-yl tetradecanoate), beeswax and petroleum jelly on a hot plate.<br>
 Pour the hot disodium tetraborate (III) solution into the mixture of hot oils and stir.<br>
 When cool, add perfume and colour.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.5.5H">7.5.5</a> Lotions</a><br>
Lotions, cosmetic creams and ointments are mostly emulsions of oils dispersed in water.<br>
Also, hair wave lotion and water glass are used to preserve eggs.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.5.6H">7.5.6</a> Margarine<br>
Margarine is an emulsion of water, flavours, colours, and vitamins in a semi-solid fat, usually vegetable oils.<br>
However, vegetable oils are liquids at room temperature, so  hydrogenation is used to break double bonds, saturate the chains with hydrogen and increase the MP.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.5.7H">7.5.7</a> Prepare mayonnaise and salad dressing emulsions<br>
 Mayonnaise is a mixture of olive oil dispersed in vinegar and stabilized by egg yolk or mustard.<br>
 Beat 15 ml of edible oil with one egg yolk and water to produce a weak emulsion<br>
 Beat 120 ml of oil with one egg yolk and water to give a strong emulsion<br>
 Place egg yolks, lemon juice or vinegar and salt in a large glass bowl.<br>
 Use a balloon whisk to combine the mixture until it begins to thicken.<br>
 Pour drops of an edible oil into the egg yolk mixture and whisk until well combined.<br>
 Whisk the oil in gradually, because if it is added too quickly the oil may not emulsify and the mayonnaise could separate or curdle.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.5.8H">7.5.8</a> Milk<br>
Milk is a poor emulsion.<br>
The forces of cohesion between the emulsified cream droplets are greater than the forces of adhesion between the milk and the cream.<br>
So cream floats above the milk.<br>
In homogenized milk, the droplets have been broken into smaller particles and dispersed to form one phase.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.5.9H">7.5.9</a> Ouzo effect, microemulsions<br>
 When water is added to clear solutions of some alcoholic drinks, e.g. ouzo, pastis, sambuca, the drinks become a milky white microemulsio.<br>
 This milkiness is caused by the terpenes, e.g. Anethole, used for flavouring are soluble in alcohol, but not in water.<br>
 The added water creates a suspension of terpenes that have left the alcohol solution.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.5.10H">7.5.10</a> Soap as an emulsifying agent<br>
 Soap in water have molecules that have both lyophilic and lyophobic parts so is called an association colloid.<br>
 Soap molecules (sodium stearate), can cause droplets of fat to become negatively charged.<br>
 These droplets remain suspended in the water and can be become washed away during cleaning.<br>
 Soap is not soluble in saltwater.<br>
Experiment<br>
 Add drops of vegetable oil or paraffin oil to: 1. water, 2. soap solution, 3. gelatine solution.<br>
 Leave the solutions to stand and note the separation.<br>
 The oil separates first in 1, then in 2, and then in 3.<br>
 If a stable emulsion forms in 3. the liquids may not separate.<br>
 Association colloids, e.g. soap in water have a dispersed phase part lyophobic and part lyophilic.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.5.11H">7.5.11</a> Temporary emulsions and permanent emulsions<br>
 1. Add 5 drops of kerosene to 5 mL of water and shake the test-tube.<br>
 Leave to stand and observe the separation into two layers.<br>
 Add liquid detergent, shake, and leave to stand.<br>
 Observe the permanent emulsion.<br>
 2. Add 5 drops of oil to 5 mL of water and shake the test-tube.<br>
 Leave to stand and observe the separation into two layers.<br>
 Add liquid detergent, shake, and leave to stand.<br>
 Observe the permanent emulsion.<br>
 3. Mix 5 mL of oil and 5 mL vinegar.<br>
 Leave to stand and observe the separation into two layers.<br>
 Add mustard or egg yolk, shake, and leave to stand.<br>
 Observe the salad oil permanent emulsion.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.6.01H">7.6.01</a> Suspensions and precipitates<br>
 Suspensions are heterogeneous systems of particles containing many molecules in a liquid, e.g. clay particles in water.<br>
 Observe the suspension particles.<br>
 Suspension particles eventually settle on standing.<br>
 The smaller the size of the suspension particles the longer the time to settle.<br>
 Under a microscope the suspension particles show Brownian movement.<br>
 A suspension has large solid solute particles that can be seen, settle out on standing and do not pass through filters or permeable membranes.<br>
 Examples suspensions include. milk of magnesia, Mg(OH)2, calamine lotion and muddy water.<br>
 The two or more components of a suspension are easily visible.<br>
 Precipitates are solids that form in a solution.<br>
 Precipitates form when the particles of dissolved substances join, and fall down, to leave the solution.<br>
 A precipitate may appear as a cloudy suspension in solution or as coagulated lumps.<br>

 Clay soils needs deep digging with the addition of gypsum and compost.<br>
 Fill to 3/4 a measuring cylinder with mixture of clay soil and water.<br>
 Shake the mixture then leave it to settle.<br>
 Note which particles settle and in what order.<br>
 For particles that do not float the smaller the particles the longer they take to settle.<br>
 Filter the milky coloured liquid.<br>
 The filter paper stops some particles, but the filtrate is still cloudy, because clay particles can pass through the filter paper.<br>
 Some particles remain in suspension for a long time, because they are small and water molecules hit them on all sides, caused by Brownian movement.<br>

 1. Solubility<br>
The solubility of a solute in a solvent is the number of moles or grams of the solute that can dissolve in a volume.<br>
 It is usually 100 g of the solvent (1 dm3 of water), at room temperature, usually 20 oC.<br>
 The solubility of a substance is the weight of solute that can dissolve in a solvent at a particular temperature.<br>
 For example, the solubility of sodium chloride is 36 g /100 g of water at 20 oC.<br>
 The solubility of gases decreases as the temperature rises.<br>
 When a more concentrated solution is diluted with a solvent,<br>
 C 1 V 1 = C 2 V 2, where C 1 = original concentration, V 1 = original volume, C 2 = 
 final concentration, V 2 = final volume.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.7.1aH">7.7.1a</a> Solubility equilibrium, solubility product, Ksp<br>
 When the forward process continues as the same rate as the reverse process in a reversible chemical reaction, the system is at equilibrium and its properties will not change, e.g. colour.<br>
 A dissolving solid and its solution reach equilibrium when the rate of crystallization equals the rate of dissolving.<br>
 Silver chloride has a low solubility in water.<br>
 AgCl (s) <=> Ag + (aq) + Cl - (aq)<br>
 Let [Ag+] = concentration of silver ions and [Cl-] = concentration of chloride ions.<br>
 The solubility at fixed temperature is constant.<br>
 Therefore, constant = [Ag+] × [Cl-], called the solubility product, K sp for a saturated solution of silver chloride at room temperature.<br>
 It is the equilibrium constant for that solid solution system.<br>
 Some solubility products, Ksp:<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.7.2H">7.7.2</a> Solutions, Rates of solution<br>
 A solution is a homogeneous system (no boundaries), that consists of a solute dissolved in a solvent.<br>
 The particles are usually molecules or ions.<br>
 An alloy, e.g. steel, is an example of solutions of solids dissolved in solids.<br>
 A saturated solution is a solution in which no more solute can dissolve at that temperature.<br>
 In a solution, the solid particles are very small, cannot be seen, and do not settle.<br>
 A solution is uniform in appearance, and clear or coloured.<br>
 The solute may be regained from the solvent by evaporation and can pass through fine filters and permeable membranes.<br>
 Solutions may contain more than one solute<br>
 The presence of one dissolved substance does not prevent other substances dissolving in the solution.<br>
 As general rule, unless the concentrations are high, one solute does not affect the solubility of others.<br>
Rates of solution<br>
 Increase the rate at which some solid dissolves in water in three ways:<br>
 1. Grind the solid into smaller pieces.<br>
 Take two equal quantities of large crystals of copper (II) sulfate-5-water.<br>
 Grind one quantity into a fine powder.<br>
 Put both samples into equal quantities of water in separate test-tubes and shake.<br>
 Compare the rates at which the different samples dissolve.<br>
 2. Shake the solution while the solid is dissolving.<br>
 Put equal quantities of sugar into separate equal quantities of water in two test-tubes.<br>
 Shake one tube and leave the other to stand.<br>
 Compare the rates at which the samples dissolve.<br>
 3. Heat the solution.<br>
 Put equal quantities of potassium nitrate in equal quantities of water in two test-tubes.<br>
 Shake both test-tubes, holding one of them over a flame.<br>
 Compare the rates at which the samples dissolve.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.7.3H">7.7.3</a> Evaporation of sea water<br>
 1. When sea water in a rock pool evaporates, white crystals form along the edge of the pool.<br>
 If all the sea water evaporates, the final solid will contain about 0.5% carbonates, 3% gypsum, and 96.5% sodium chloride.<br>
 2. However, when the sea water starts to evaporate and crystals start to form, calcium is the only cation near saturation.<br>
 3. As water evaporates from the sea water, the order of precipitation is mainly:<br>
 * Calcium carbonate, calcite, and also calcium magnesium carbonate, dolomite,<br>
 * Calcium sulfate dihydrate, gypsum,<br>
 * Sodium chloride when the volume of the sea water is about 10% of the original,<br>
 * Potassium and magnesium salts.<br>
 4. If carbon dioxide is dissolved in the sea water, there is no extra precipitation of calcium carbonate.<br>
 The pH of sea water is 7.8 and carbon dioxide is present mainly as bicarbonate (HC03 -, about 90%).<br>
 Dissolving more carbon dioxide lowers the pH and the equilibrium shifts to converting more carbonate to bicarbonate.<br>
 5. On a ship, fresh water can be produced form seawater, by using heat from the engine to heat the water in a chamber which has a partial vacuum,<br>
i.e. pressure lower than atmospheric pressure.<br>
The evaporated sea water is left to cool to room temperature.<br>
This process is expensive, because ot the cost of running evaporation pumps.<br>

 7. Solubility of different salts and temperature<br>
 Most ionic substances increase in solubility with increases of temperature.<br>
 After completing the experiment, keep the recrystallized salts in special jars and record each solubility on the label of the jar.<br>
 Record as solubility in 100 g of water, to nearest gram and o C.<br>

 Colloids are a kind of mixture where one substance is dispersed throughout another substance.<br>
 So two phases exist, the dispersed internal phase and the continuous dispersion medium phase.<br>
 Colloids are glue-like amorphous substances, e.g. gelatine or starch, with particles bigger than most molecules,<br>
 i.e. 5 × 10 -9 to 5 × 10 -6 m (5 to 5000 nanometres, nm).<br>
 The particles are too large to pass through a membrane, but too small to be observed under a microscope.<br>
 Colloids have a dispersed phase of particles scattered through a continuous phase, the medium.<br>
 Colloids differ from crystalloids, e.g. inorganic salts that can pass through a membrane.<br>
 Colloids are a type of mixture with properties between that of true solutions and suspensions.<br>
 Colloids do not separate on standing, but can pass through filters.<br>
 Colloidal particles are uniformly distributed in solution, cannot be seen under the microscope, but are still too large to pass through membranes.<br>
 Colloids can scatter light and the common white colour of colloids is, because of the reflection by the particles of all colours of the spectrum.<br>

 Wounds may be covered with hydrocolloid dressings to improve healing.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.8.17H">7.8.17</a> Hydrophilic substances<br>
Hydrophilic / hydrophobic substances<br>
1. Hydrophilic substances are "water-loving" substances, polar molecule materials that mix with water, are attracted to water and may dissolve in water to form hydrogen bonds, e.g. glucose, sugars.<br>
They have an affinity for water and are readily absorbed or wetted by water.<br>
Hydrophilic colloids readily form hydrosols or remain as hydrosols.<br>
2. Hydrophobic substances are "water-hating" substances, non-polar molecule materials, often oily, do not mix with water or they repel water, e.g. oils, proteins, greases, clays.<br>
Hydrophobic colloids do not form or remain as hydrosols.<br>
Soap molecules have one end polar and the other end non-polar, so they can attach to oils yet dissolve in water.<br>
The aversion to water of a person suffering from the disease rabies is called "hydrophobia".<br>
3. The hydrophobic force prevents the dispersion of oil in water, so to make oil and water emulsions, e.g. French salad dressing.<br>
A salad dressing contain a vegetable oil, an acidifying agent, e.g. vinegar or lemon juice, egg yolk and starch.<br>
Emulsifiers contain one region that is hydrophobic. (oil loving). and the other half is hydrophilic, (water loving).<br>
The best emulsifying ingredients for salad dressings and vinaigrettes are egg yolks, mustard, mayonnaise, honey, and mashed avocado.<br>
The components have to be shaken with the addition of stabilizing agents.<br>
Salad dressings<br>
A droplet of oil put in water forms a circle and does not mix with water.<br>
Only continuous shaking of oil in water would keep them "mixed", but they will separate when the shaking stops.<br>
Vinegars contains water and acetic acid.<br>
Oil and water do not mix, so you would have to be continually shaking a mixture of oil and water to keep it at all “mixed”.<br>
The only way of making oil and vinegar mix together for salad dressings and vinaigrettes, and not separate, is to make an emulsion by using an emulsifying agent.<br>
One end of the molecules in emulsifying agents is hydrophobic, while the other end is hydrophilic.<br>
The emulsifying agents pulling the molecules of oil and vinegar together, to form a uniform mixture.<br>
Egg yolks contain lecithin and are one of the most commonly used emulsifiers for salad dressings.<br>
Some cooks avoid using raw eggs from the fear of salmonella, so use pasteurized eggs.<br>
(The use of raw eggs for restaurant cooking is illegal in some countries.)<br>
Mix the emulsifying agent with vinegar first, with continuous whisking, then slowly add the oil.<br>
Mayonnaise is a good emulsifier, it contains egg yolks.<br>
Dijon mustard is the most popular type of mustard used for dressings and vinaigrettes.<br>
The simplest vinaigrette is made with Dijon mustard, red wine vinegar, and olive oil.<br>
One of the easiest vinaigrettes to make with honey is to mix it with balsamic vinegar, olive oil, and seasonings.<br>
4. Non-polar molecules, do not have a strong separation of charge.<br>
The positive and negative charges in a non-polar molecule are more or less distributed evenly.<br>
Fats and oils are examples of non-polar molecules.<br>
Non-polar molecules mix well with other non-polar molecules, but they do not mix with polar molecules.<br>
So oil and grease mix well together, but neither mixes with water.<br>
Non-polar molecules are often said to be hydrophobic, or "water fearing".<br>
Lycopodium powder, made from the dried spores of club mosses, contain a lot of fat, which is hydrophobic.<br>
When you sprinkle lycopodium powder on the surface of water, then stick your finger through the powder into the water, the powder coats your finger and prevents the water from touching your skin, so when you pull out our finger, it feels dry.<br>

<a href="../images/13.8.2.0.gif">See diagram 13.8.2.0</a> : Aerosol can<br>
Aerosols (fogs), are colloidal dispersions of particles of liquids or solids suspended in another gas, e.g. fly spray, mist, fog, clouds, smoke.<br>
The term "aerosols" also refers to substances packed under pressure in a container so that the substances can be released as a fine spray.<br>
The containers with contents are sometimes called "aerosols", e.g. a domestic fly spray.<br>
An aerosol spray can is a pressurized container with an attached spray mechanism.<br>
It is used to produce small amounts of product in a finely divided form, e.g. anti-perspirants, insecticides, medicines (nasal sprays), paint.<br>
The pressure inside the aerosol can is much greater than atmosphere pressure.<br>
Propellant<br>
A propellant is dissolved in the product to push it out when the aerosol can is opened.<br>
The propellants are usually alkanes, e.g. butane.<br>
Chlorofluorocarbons, CFC gases, are no longer used as propellants, because they may increase the greenhouse effect.<br>
Definition from the "Draft Australian criteria for the classification of hazardous chemicals": Aerosols<br>
Aerosols (aerosol dispensers), means any non-refillable receptacles made of metal, glass or plastics,<br>
 containing a gas compressed, liquefied or dissolved under pressure, with or without a liquid, paste or powder,<br>
and fitted with a release device allowing the contents to be ejected as solid or liquid particles in suspension in a gas, as a foam, paste or powder,<br>
 or in a liquid state or in a gaseous state.<br>

 Sulfated polysaccharide hydrocolloid produced from red seaweed, Rhodophyceae, Chondrus crispis, Eucheuma spinosum, Ucheuma cottonii, Gigartina sp.<br>
 Vegetable gum, food additive E407, used for gelling and thickening, can form firm gels with potassium ions,<br>
 and can form elastic gels and thixotropic fluids with calcium ions<br>
 Cform viscous non-gelling solutions are free flowing jellies or firm gels.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.8.5H">7.8.5</a> Gels<br>
 1. Gels are colloids in which liquids are dispersed in solids to form a jelly.<br>
 They are semi-rigid systems, between the liquid state and the solid state, that consist of random networks of colloidal fibres or crystals, with liquid in the spaces.<br>
 Gels are colloidal systems that have set.<br>
 Some gels can lose one component by heating to leave a solid, e.g. silica gel.<br>
 Hydrogels have insoluble chains of polymers in a network that can contain very high concentrations of water.<br>
 They can be used for breast implants, water holding granules for dry soils, burn dressings, baby nappies (diapers), sanitary napkins, contact lenses and water sensors.<br>
 Environmentally sensitive hydrogels can be used to detect specific concentrations of substances or temperature or pH then release the substances they are carrying.<br>
 Hydrogels include acrylate polymers, polyvinyl alcohol, sodium polyacrylate and natural hydrogels, e.g. methyl cellulose and may have thixotropy,<br>
 i.e. become fluid when disturbed, but solidify at rest, e.g. hair gels.<br>
 2. Gels are colloids with a three dimensional structure of a network of linked molecules, e.g. gelatine, jelly, silica gel.<br>
 Gels easily change their shape under pressure, but may flow under high pressure.<br>
 Gels form when colloidal solutions are left standing to allow a 3 dimensional network to form.<br>
 Collagen is denatured by heat to form separate molecules called gelatine that form an amorphous network when cooled.<br>
 When gelatine is dissolved in water, it forms chemical bonds with the water and acts as a semi-solid or gel, jelly.<br>
 The gel can "dissolve" when heated and then form again when cooled again.<br>
 When the proteins in egg white are denatured by heating, they form a permanent gel that does not "dissolve" when heated.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.8.6H">7.8.6</a> Sols<br>
 1. Sols are colloidal solutions, suspensions of solid or liquid particles of colloidal dimensions in a liquid.<br>
 So sols are dispersions of small groups of molecules in a medium.<br>
 Sols remain dispersed, because Brownian movement prevents the groups of molecules precipitating under the influence of gravity.<br>
 2. Aerosols are more like solutions and are stable, e.g. starch in water, have large dispersed particles with an affinity with the medium.<br>
 Hydrophilic sols are the water loving sols.<br>
 Lyophilic sols are easily dispersed in certain mediums and may be redispersed after coagulation.<br>
 The particles of some protein solutions have a chemical shell of water molecules around them
 This prevents them flocculating unless a strong salt solution is added to precipitate the colloid.<br>
 4. Lyophobic sols (hydrophobic sols, solvent-hating sols), are difficult to disperse into an unstable solution and cannot be reformed after coagulation.<br>
 They can form precipitates, because they have a dispersed phase with no affinity with the medium, e.g. silver chloride precipitates in photography.<br>
 The particles keep apart, because of their electrical charge, but eventually they precipitate.<br>
 5. Xanthan gum, vegetable gum food additive, E415, comes from corn sugar (maize), fermentation, e.g. maize, by a strain of Xanthomonas campestris.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.8.7H">7.8.7</a> Prepare bean curd, (tofu, soya bean)<br>
 Weigh 50 g of moth free and mildew free soybeans and put them in a 500 mL beaker.<br>
 Add 300 mL water to soak for 24 hours to make the soybeans fully swell.<br>
 Replace the water if the atmospheric temperature is high.<br>
 Then pour out the water.<br>
 Grind the soaked soybeans in 200 mL water by using a household grinder.<br>
 To make soybean milk, transfer the soybean slurry to a filter fitted with two pieces of filter cloth, and filter by suction.<br>
 Wash the filter cake many times with 100 mL water to extract the soybean milk fully from the bean dregs.<br>
 The filtrate obtained is concentrated soybean milk.<br>
 Pour the concentrated soybean milk (or alternatively use industrial concentrated soybean milk in bags), into a clean 500 mL beaker and heat to about 80 o C.<br>
 Add saturated gypsum aqueous solution to the hot soybean milk.<br>
 Stir constantly until white wads appear.<br>
 Stop heating and let the soybean milk stand for five minutes.<br>
 Solid lumps start to separate out of the bean milk.<br>
 After standing for about 20 minutes, filter the solidified lumps from the bean milk.<br>
 Gather the lumps and shape them into a cube folded up in the filter cloth.<br>
 Place the cube on a clean plate and press it by putting a small beaker containing cold water on it.<br>
 About 30 minutes later, a cake of bean curd forms.<br>
 The bean curd will be whiter and more tender if concentrated soybean milk is used.<br>
 To preserve the freshly made bean curd from deterioration for a few days, soak it in 2-5% table salt aqueous solution and keep it in a cool, shady place.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.8.10H">7.8.10</a> Foams<br>
 Foams are solutions of gases in solids or liquids.<br>
 Foams, e.g. foam rubber, expanded polystyrene, have been stabilized with surfactants (surface acting agents), e.g. detergents.<br>
 A foam is gas dispersed in a liquid, e.g. foam on beer, whipped cream, fire extinguisher foam.<br>
 A solid foam is gas dispersed in a solid, e.g. marshmallow, foam rubber mattress, expanded plastics (foamed plastics), e.g. Styrofoam.<br>
 A foam is a sort of cellular solid with a gas matrix.<br>
 Solid foams are often highly flammable.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.8.16H">7.8.16</a> Tyndall effect, sunbeams<br>
 The Tyndall effect (John Tyndall, 1820-1893, UK), is caused by reflection of light by very small particles in suspension.<br>
 It can be seen from the dust in the air when sunlight comes in through a window to form "sunbeams",<br>
or when light comes down through holes in clouds or the visible headlight beams during foggy nights or on dusty roads.<br>
 A laser pointer can show the Tyndall effect in diluted milk or colloidal silver as the light beam passing through the liquid.<br>
 The Tyndall effect increases with concentration, but it is not used to measure the concentration of a sol, but only whether a colloid is present or not.<br>
 Shine light in one side of a box with a scattering solution, e.g. colloidal silver, smoke, and see the scattered light out in a perpendicular direction.<br>
 The Tyndall effect refers to the translucence of some colloids caused by scattering of light by colloid particles.<br>
 When a beam of light passes through some suspensions and colloids containing particles with diameters &lt; 1/20 the wavelength of light,<br>
 the scattered light appears mainly blue, e.g. tobacco smoke suspension.<br>
 Direct a beam of light through the solution.<br>
 If you can see the solute particles, the solution is colloidal, because of the scattering of light.<br>
Experiments<br>
 Fill 250 mL beaker with yellow potassium chromate solution (K 2 CrO 4 ).<br>
 This is a true solution so it will not scatter light.<br>
 Prepare the following test solutions in 250 mL beakers:<br>

 2. Starch solution,<br>
 3. 2 mL olive oil,<br>
 4. 10 mL water, 4 drops detergent, shake and put in a large test-tube,<br>
 5. Weak black tea,<br>
 6. Instant coffee solution,<br>
 7. Detergent in a beaker of water,<br>
 8. Toothpaste shaken in a beaker of water,<br>
 Put each beaker of test solution next the beaker of potassium chromate solution and pass light from a projector through both solutions.<br>
 Observe light passing through both solutions to detect which solutions are colloids.<br>
