<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.3.0H">7.3.0</a> Metals, non-metals, transition metals<br>
See: <a href="./commercial/Comlist.html#Chemistry">Chemistry</a> (Commercial)<br>
 1. Metals are elements that form positive ions.<br>
 Metals may also form complex ions with a non-metal, e.g. chromate ion, CrO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-.</sup>.<br>
 2. Non-metals are elements that form negative ions.<br>
 Non-metals may also combine with other non-metals, e.g. NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>.<br>
 The first 105 elements in the periodic table contain 84 metals and 21 non-metals (or metalloids).<br>
 Metalloids have both metal and non-metal, e.g. B, Si, As, Te and Ge, Sb, Bi.<br>
 3. Transition elements include:<br>
 First series: Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu (and perhaps Zn),<br>
 Second series: Mo and Ag, and<br>
 Third series: Pt, Au (and perhaps Hg).<br>
 Transition elements are hard, dense metals with high melting points and boiling points, form coloured ions and compounds and have more than one valence (oxidation number), e.g. copper (Cu<sup>1+</sup>and
 Cu<sup>2+</sup>), and chromium (Cr<sup>2+</sup> and Cr<sup>3+</sup>).<br>
 The ion Cr<sup>2+</sup>is a strong reducing agent and forms blue salts in solution.<br>
 Cr<sup>3+</sup>salts are green in solution.<br>
 CrO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> salts are yellow in solution. Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub><sup>2-</sup> is a strong oxidizing agent with orange salts in solution, e.g. K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>.<br>
 3. Transition metals form complex ions and often have catalytic activity, e.g. Fe in the complex haemoglobin molecule, and Fe in the manufacture of ammonia.<br>
 Observe common metals and non-metals, e.g. aluminium foil, calcium granules, carbon as charcoal, copper foil or wire, iodine crystals, lead foil or lead shot, magnesium ribbon, nickel sheets or plating, red phosphorus, potassium (in liquid paraffin), sodium (in liquid paraffin), sulfur powder or "flowers", tin foil or tin-plating, zinc foil or granulated zinc.<br>
 List the metallic or non-metallic properties: you can observe.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.3.1H">7.3.1</a> Properties of metals<br>
 1. Metals are usually opaque, hard solids with high density and have shiny, silvery lustre, when cut or scratched.<br>
 2. Metals have strong metallic bonds that make them malleable, ductile and easy to bend.<br>
 3. Metals have high melting points, boiling points and density.<br>
 4. You can hammer metals into new shapes, because they are malleable.<br>
 5. Metals can be drawn into a wire, because they are ductile.<br>
 6. Metals have freely-moving electrons and thus are good conductors of electricity and heat.<br>
 7. Metals may form oxides that turn moist litmus blue, e.g. calcium oxide dissolves in water to form the alkali calcium hydroxide.<br>
 8. Some metals form a surface layer of oxide that prevents more oxidation, e.g. Al, Cr, Mg and Zn.<br>
 9. Reactive metals have stable compounds.<br>
 10. Stable metals have compounds that easily decompose.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.3.2H">7.3.2</a> Properties of non-metals<br>
 1. Non-metals may be monatomic, e.g. Ne, He, polyatomic, e.g. F<sub>2</sub>, white phosphorus P, or network solids, e.g. diamond, red phosphorus.<br>
 2. Non-metals may be solids, liquids or gases.<br>
 3. Non-metals that are solids are usually dull and brittle, and have low density.<br>
 4. Non-metals are usually poor conductors of electricity and heat, and form oxides that turn moist litmus red.<br>
 For example, carbon dioxide dissolves in water to form the weak acid, carbonic acid (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>).<br>
 H<sub>2</sub>O (l) &lt;--&gt; H<sup>+</sup> (aq) + OH<sup>-</sup> (aq)<br>
 2H<sup>+</sup> (aq) + CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> (aq) &lt;--&gt; H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (aq) carbonic acid<br>
 CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O &lt;--&gt; H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> + HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup><br>
 HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O &lt;--&gt; H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> + CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup><br>
 6. Exceptions to the properties: of non-metals include:<br>
 Graphite carbon that conducts electricity,<br>
 Silicon that has the physical properties: of a metal.<br>

Silicon is a metalloid, because it has physical properties of metals and chemical properties of non-metals.<br>
 Silicon is a semiconductor.<br>
 Silicon does not exist free in nature, but occurs mainly as silicon (IV) oxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>), in silica sand, sandstone, clay, quartz and opal.<br>
 Silicates occur in most rocks and glass.<br>
 Portland cement is a mixture of calcium and aluminium silicates.<br>
 In the silicone oils and greases, the silicon atoms form polymers containing a chain of silicon and oxygen atoms with carbon and hydrogen atoms attached to the chain.<br>
 Silicones repel water.<br>
 Silica glass, an amorphous solid, is more like a "super cooled liquid" than a crystal, because, unlike crystalline substances, it does not have a sharp melting point.<br>
 However, some chemists say that glass is a disordered solid not a supercooled liquid.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Main types of glass<br>
<a name="SodalimeglassH">Soda-lime glass</a><br>
1. Soda-lime glass<br>
 Round glass jars may contain: SiO<sub>2</sub>, CaO, K<sub>2</sub>O, MgO, TiO<sub>2</sub><br>
 Flat window glass may contain: SiO<sub>2</sub>, CaO, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, TiO<sub>2</sub><br>
 2. Borosilicate glass, Pyrex: <a href="./topics/topicIndexB.html#7.9.10H">7.9.10</a><br>
 3. Fused quartz glass may contain: SiO<sub>2</sub>, used in some camera lenses.<br>
Experiments<br>
<a name="WaterglassH">Water glass</a><br>
1. Waterglass is a colloidal solution of sodium or potassium silicate in water that solidifies on exposure to the air.<br>
 It is used in chemical gardens, egg preserving, paper sizing, fire resistant paint and fresco painting.<br>
 Sodium carbonate is heated with sand to produce sodium silicate, the water soluble water glass used is an inorganic builder in detergents, and for fireproofing materials.<br>
 Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>(s) + SiO<sub>2</sub> (s) --> Na<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub>(g)<br>
 Na2CO3 + SiO2 -->Na2O∙SiO2 + CO2<br>
 sodium carbonate + silicon dioxide --> sodium silicate (water glass) + carbon dioxide<br>
 2. When sodium oxide Na<sub>2</sub>O 15%, silicon dioxide SiO<sub>2</sub>
 70%, and calcium oxide CaO 10% and other oxides are heated together with temperatures up to 1000<sup>o</sup>C, insoluble silica glass forms in which all the crystalline order of the added minerals has been lost.<br>
 In silica glass (soda lime silica glass, crown glass), each silicon atom is surrounded by four oxygen atoms as a tetrahedron and each of these is linked to other tetrahedra.<br>
 When ionic oxides are added in the glass making melt they get between the Si-O-Si bridges and weaken it, as shown in the transition glass temperatures: silica glass Tg = about 1200<sup>o</sup>C, Pyrex 
 Tg = 550<sup>o</sup>C, window glass Tg = 550<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 3. The glass in high quality wine glasses (lead crystal), contains lead, which gives the glass a ringing sound, higher refractive index and more brilliance.<br>
 Cobalt gives blue glass, chromium gives green glass, and copper gives red or blue-green glass.<br>
 Boron oxide, B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, gives shockproof borosilicate glass, "Pyrex", that is resistant to all chemicals except hydrofluoric acid, HF.<br>
 Flint glass, lead glass, has no colour unlike crown glass that has a slight green to yellow colour due to iron impurity.<br>
 4. The 2 distinct constituents of glass are as follows:<br>
 4.1 The network former, i.e. the non-metal as an oxide is usually silicon, but it can be boron, aluminium, or phosphorus.<br>
 4.2 The network modifiers, e.g. sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium.<br>
 Glass may crystallize over a period of many years and then become more brittle, but some glass has remained uncrystallized for 4000 years in Egypt.<br>
 Sodium sesquicarbonate Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>.NaHCO<sub>3</sub>.H<sub>2</sub>O
 occurs as a mineral.<br>
 4.3 A famous urban legend has the opinion that glass in panes of old cathedrals and even early American buildings is thicker at the bottom, because the glass has "flowed" down over along periods.<br>
 The most likely explanation is that at a time when the thickness of panes of glass varied at that stage of technology, glaziers always inserted the thicker sides down.<br>
 5. Collect drinking glasses, including wine glasses, of roughly the same size.<br>
 Strike each glass and listen to the ring to identify the existence of modifiers in the glass.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.2.4.0H">7.2.4.0</a> Prepare silicon glass<br>
 1. Pick up sodium carbonate in a nichrome wire loop.<br>
 Dip the loop into powdered silica and heat over a burner to form a transparent bead of glass.<br>
 2. Prepare silicon glass in a furnace<br>
 Prepare glass in a crucible by heating a glass mixture in a furnace or over a Meker burner with a hot wide flame.<br>
 Glass mixture A: 17 g clean sand, 4.4 g sodium carbonate, 5.2 g disodium tetraborate (III)-10-water (borax).<br>
 Glass mixture B: 6 g clean sand, 2 g sodium carbonate, 1 g calcium carbonate.<br>
 3. Prepare coloured glass<br>
 Add a metal oxide to the glass mixture.<br>
 Heat the end of a glass rod to red heat.<br>
 Dip it into a powdered metallic oxide and heat until the oxide fuses into the glass.<br>
 4. Use salts to colour glass:<br>
 * For amethyst, use manganese (IV) oxide.<br>
 * For green, use black copper (II) oxide.<br>
 * For ruby, use red copper (I) oxide.<br>
 * For white, use tin oxide.<br>
 5. Mix a little silica with an equal quantity of calcium carbonate and about twice as much anhydrous sodium carbonate.<br>
 Grind them to a powder in a mortar with a pestle.<br>
 Make a loop in a platinum wire.<br>
 Heat the loop and place it in the mixture.<br>
 Reheat the wire with the adhering mixture until the mixture fuses, then cool it.<br>
 6. Describe the bead.<br>
 Hit it with a hammer to se if it is t brittle,<br>
 Does it dissolve in water?<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.2.5.0H">7.2.5.0</a> Prepare silicate gardens<br>
 1. Mix one part of sodium silicate (IV) (Na<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub>) with four parts of water to make water glass.<br>
 Gently add crystals of salts to the solution without mixing to make chemical "flowers" grow:<br>
 * Chlorides: Co, Fe, Cu, Ni and Pb,<br>
 * Sulfates: Al, Fe, Cu, and Ni,<br>
 * Nitrates: Co, Fe, Cu and Ni.<br>
 2. Put sand 1 cm deep in a 500 mL jar.<br>
 Make a 1: 1 mixture of sodium silicate and water (water glass), and pour it onto the sand to almost fill the jar.<br>
 Leave the jar to stand undisturbed for a day.<br>
 Drop in crystals of metal salts, e.g. metal hydroxides, iron sulfate, copper (II) sulfate, alum, Epsom salts.<br>
 Observe crystals forming "shoots".<br>
 Some shoots are directed up by small bubbles.<br>
 The metal hydroxide skin formed around the crystal is permeable only to water and not the salt.<br>
 The water diffuses in to balance the concentrations each side of the skin until the skin bursts the skin then forms again further from the crystal.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.2.5.1H">7.2.5.1</a> Silicon tetrachloride with water<br>
 Silicon tetrachloride, a chlorosilane, is an epoxy resin hardener.<br>
 Highly toxic by all routes, with irritating fumes.<br>
 Stoppers of glass reagent bottles containing it may stick and the bottles may explode, so use very small containers.<br>
 It reacts vigorously with sodium and other reactive metals.<br>
 Silicon tetrachloride reacts vigorously with water to form insoluble silicon dioxide and an acidic hydrogen chloride solution that gives off fumes of hydrogen chloride and dissociates to form hydrochloric acid solution.<br>
 SiCl<sub>4</sub> (s) + 2H<sub>2</sub>O (l) --> SiO<sub>2</sub> (s) + 4HCl (aq)<br>

<a href="./appendices/appendixD.html#3.4.04H">See 3.4.04</a>: Super ball, (toy product)<br>
 The silicone polymer in silly putty, polyborosiloxane, have covalent bonds within the molecules, but hydrogen bonds between the molecules.<br>
 The hydrogen bonds are easily broken.<br>
 A silicone is chains of (OH-Si-O-Si-O-Si-OH), with two methyl groups, CH<sub>3</sub> on each of the Si atoms.<br>
 However, in "Silly putty", boron atoms that can cross link weakly with oxygen atoms in other chains replace some of the silicon atoms.<br>
 Experiments<br>
 1. Mix 55% Elmer's glue solution and 16% sodium borate in a 4: 1 ratio.<br>
 Ingredients: 65% dimethyl siloxane, hydroxy terminated, polymers with boric acid, 17% silica, quartz crystalline, 9% thixotrol ST, 4% polydimethylsiloxane, 1% decamethyl cyclopentasiloxane, 1% glycerine, 1% titanium dioxide.<br>
 2. Apply small amounts of stress are slowly to the putty only a few bonds are broken and the putty "flows" and stretches a great distance.<br>
 Apply larger amounts of stress quickly, many hydrogen bonds are broken, and the putty breaks or tears.<br>
 Roll it into a ball that you can bounce.<br>
 Press it onto a pencil drawing so that it lifts off the pencil marks so you can see the drawing on the surface of the silly putty.<br>

 Silicone rubbers, e.g. PVMQ. a low-temperature resistant rubber cross-linked with vinyl groups, and used for gaskets, because it is temperature resistant.<br>
 Polysiloxanes, [repeat unit: -Si(RR<sup>'</sup>)O-, where R = organic group, e.g. methyl], are also used for aquarium seals and building seals.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.4.3.2H">7.4.3.2</a> Temperature at which  an ice and salt mixture freezes<br>
At 0<sup>o</sup>C, the molecules in pure water form strong bonds to form ice.<br>

Sea water contains about 35 grams of salt per litre and freezes at -1.8<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
Experiment<br>
Mix crushed ice with salt.<br>
Note the temperature after five minutes.<br>
The temperature of the ice and salt mixture is below zero, e.g. about -21<sup>o</sup>C,  if 1: 3 ratio of sodium chloride to ice.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.6.01H">7.6.01</a> Suspensions and precipitates<br>
 Suspensions are heterogeneous systems of particles containing many molecules in a liquid, e.g. clay particles in water.<br>
 Observe the suspension particles.<br>
 Suspension particles eventually settle on standing.<br>
 The smaller the size of the suspension particles the longer the time to settle.<br>
 Under a microscope the suspension particles show Brownian movement.<br>
 A suspension has large solid solute particles that can be seen, settle out on standing and do not pass through filters or permeable membranes, e.g. milk of magnesia, Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>, calamine lotion and muddy water.<br>
 The two or more components of a suspension are easily visible.<br>
 Precipitates are solids that form in a solution.<br>
 Precipitates form when the particles of dissolved substances join, and fall down, to leave the solution.<br>
 A precipitate may appear as a cloudy suspension in solution or as coagulated lumps.<br>
 It may be white or coloured.<br>


<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.6.1H">7.6.1</a> Clay soils in water<br>
 Clay soils needs deep digging with the addition of gypsum and compost.<br>
 Fill to 3/4 a measuring cylinder with mixture of clay soil and water.<br>
 Shake the mixture then leave it to settle.<br>
 Note which particles settle and in what order.<br>
 For particles that do not float the smaller the particles the longer they take to settle.<br>
 Filter the milky coloured liquid.<br>
 The filter paper stops some particles, but the filtrate is still cloudy, because clay particles can pass through the filter paper.<br>
 Some particles remain in suspension for a long time, because they are small and water molecules hit them on all sides, caused by Brownian movement.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.6.2H">7.6.2</a> Salts with clay suspension<br>
 In many hot countries, salt crystallizes from pans built on clay beds near the mouths of rivers.<br>
 Divide the clay filtrate into two test-tubes.<br>
 Keep test-tube as a control.<br>
 To the other test-tube, add drops of sodium chloride solution.<br>
 The filtrate becomes clear.<br>
 The effect occurs when a clay suspension in a river meets the salts in sea water.<br>

 Another method is to attach the test-tube to the spoke of an upturned bicycle then turn the pedals with your hand.<br>
 During the whirling, the heavier particles move to the closed end of the tube and separate partly from the liquid.<br>
 2. Shake an emulsion in water then centrifuge it.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.6.6H">7.6.6</a> Solution<br>
 A solution is a homogeneous system (no boundaries), that consists of a solute dissolved in a solvent.<br>
 The particles are usually molecules or ions.<br>
 An alloy, e.g. steel, is an example of solutions of solids dissolved in solids.<br>
 A saturated solution is a solution in which no more solute can dissolve at that temperature.<br>
 In a solution, the solid particles are very small, cannot be seen, and do not settle.<br>
 A solution is uniform in appearance, clear or coloured, the solute may be regained from the solvent by evaporation and can pass through fine filters and permeable membranes.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.6.7H">7.6.7</a> Solubility<br>
 The solubility of a solute in a solvent is the number of moles or grams of the solute that can dissolve in a volume, usually 100 g of the solvent (1 dm<sup>3</sup> of water), at room temperature, usually 20<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 The solubility of a substance is the weight of solute that can dissolve in a solvent at a particular temperature.<br>
 For example, the solubility of sodium chloride is 36 g /100 g of water at 20<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 The solubility of gases decreases as the temperature rises.<br>
 When a more concentrated solution is diluted with a solvent,<br>
 C<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub> = C<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub>, where C<sub>1</sub> = original concentration, V<sub>1</sub> = original volume, C<sub>2</sub> =

 Note how many teaspoons of the substance can be added to the water until the solution becomes saturated and no more of the substance can dissolve.<br>
 You can probably dissolve 20 spoonfuls of sugar in a cup of coffee before the coffee solution becomes saturated and undrinkable.<br>

 The next day take the drink out of the refrigerator and quickly open both drinks without any shaking.<br>

 When the forward process continues as the same rate as the reverse process in a reversible chemical reaction, the system is at equilibrium and its properties will not change, e.g. colour.<br>
 A dissolving solid and its solution reach equilibrium when the rate of crystallization equals the rate of dissolving.<br>
 Silver chloride has a low solubility in water.<br>
 AgCl (s) &lt;--&gt; Ag<sup>+</sup> (aq) + Cl<sup>-</sup> (aq)<br>
 Let [Ag<sup>+</sup>] = concentration of silver ions and [Cl<sup>-</sup>] = concentration of chloride ions.<br>
 The solubility at fixed temperature is constant.<br>
 Therefore, constant = [Ag<sup>+</sup>] × [Cl<sup>-</sup>] called the solubility product, K<sub>sp</sub> for a saturated solution of silver chloride at room temperature.<br>
 It is the equilibrium constant for that solid solution system.<br>

 When sea water in a rock pool evaporates, white crystals form along the edge of the pool.<br>
 If all the sea water evaporates, the final solid will contain about 0.5% carbonates, 3% gypsum, and 96.5% sodium chloride.<br>
 However, when the sea water starts to evaporate and crystals start to form, calcium is the only cation near saturation.<br>
 As water evaporates from the sea water, the order of precipitation is mainly:<br>
 1. calcium carbonate, calcite, and also calcium magnesium carbonate, dolomite,<br>
 2. calcium sulfate dihydrate, gypsum,<br>
 3. sodium chloride when the volume of the sea water is about 10% of the original,<br>
 4. potassium and magnesium salts.<br>
 If you dissolve more carbon dioxide in the sea water, you would not precipitate more calcium carbonate.<br>
 The pH of sea water is 7.8 and carbon dioxide is present mainly as bicarbonate (HC03<sup>-</sup>, about 90%).<br>
 Dissolving more carbon dioxide lowers the pH and the equilibrium shifts to converting more carbonate to bicarbonate.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.8.1.0H">7.8.1.0</a> Colloids and crystalloids<br>
 Colloids, sols, emulsions, gels, aerosols, foams<br>
 Colloids are a kind of mixture where one substance is dispersed throughout another substance.<br>
 So two phases exist, the dispersed internal phase and the continuous dispersion medium phase.<br>
 Colloids are glue-like amorphous substances, e.g. gelatine or starch, with particles bigger than most molecules,<br>
 i.e. 5 × 10<sup>-9</sup> to 5 × 10<sup>-6</sup>m (5 to 5000 nanometres, nm).<br>
 The particles are too large to pass through a membrane, but too small to be observed under a microscope.<br>
 Colloids have a dispersed phase of particles scattered through a continuous phase, the medium.<br>
 Colloids differ from crystalloids, e.g. inorganic salts that can pass through a membrane.<br>
 Colloids are a type of mixture with properties between that of true solutions and suspensions.<br>
 Colloids do not separate on standing, but can pass through filters.<br>
 Colloidal particles are uniformly distributed in solution, cannot be seen under the microscope, but are still too large to pass through membranes.<br>
 Colloids can scatter light and the common white colour of colloids is, because of the reflection by the particles of all colours of the spectrum.<br>
 The Scottish scientist Thomas Graham was the first to study colloids in 1861.<br>

See: <a href="./commercial/Commercial3.html#Light">Lasers</a> Tyndall's experiment, (Commercial)zzz<br>
 The Tyndall effect (John Tyndall, 1820-1893, UK), is caused by reflection of light by very small particles in suspension.<br>
 It can be seen from the dust in the air when sunlight comes in through a window to form "sunbeams", or when light comes down through holes in clouds or the visible headlight beams during foggy nights or
 on dusty roads.<br>
 A laser pointer can show the Tyndall effect in diluted milk or colloidal silver as the light beam passing through the liquid.<br>
 The Tyndall effect increases with concentration, but it is not used to measure the concentration of a sol, but only whether a colloid is present or not.<br>
 Shine light in one side of a box with a scattering solution, e.g. colloidal silver, smoke, and see the scattered light out in a perpendicular direction.<br>
 The Tyndall effect refers to the translucence of some colloids caused by scattering of light by colloid particles.<br>
 When a beam of light passes through some suspensions and colloids containing particles with diameters &lt; 1/20 the wavelength of light, the scattered light appears mainly blue, e.g. tobacco smoke suspension.<br>
 Direct a beam of light through the solution.<br>
 If you can see the solute particles, the solution is colloidal, because of the scattering of light.<br>
Experiments<br>
 Fill 250 mL beaker with yellow potassium chromate solution (K<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub>).<br>
 This is a true solution so it will not scatter light.<br>

<a href="./images/13.8.2.0.gif">See diagram 13.8.2.0</a>: Aerosol can<br>
Aerosols (fogs), are colloidal dispersions of particles of liquids or solids suspended in another gas, e.g. fly spray, mist, fog, clouds, smoke.<br>
The term "aerosols" also refers to substances packed under pressure in a container so that the substances can be released as a fine spray.<br>
The containers with contents are sometimes called "aerosols", e.g. a domestic fly spray.<br>
An aerosol spray can is a pressurized container with an attached spray mechanism.<br>
It is used to produce small amounts of product in a finely divided form, e.g. anti-perspirants, insecticides, medicines (nasal sprays), paint.<br>
The pressure inside the aerosol can is much greater than atmosphere pressure.<br>
Propellant<br> 
A propellant is dissolved in the product to push it out when the aerosol can is opened.<br>
The propellants are usually alkanes, e.g. butane.<br>
Chlorofluorocarbons, CFC gases, are no longer used as propellants, because they may increase the greenhouse effect.<br>
Definition from the "Draft Australian criteria for the classification of hazardous chemicals": Aerosols<br> 
Aerosols (aerosol dispensers), means any non-refillable receptacles made of metal, glass or plastics and containing a gas compressed, liquefied or dissolved under pressure, with or without a liquid, paste or powder, and fitted with a release device allowing the contents to be ejected as solid or liquid particles in 
suspension in a gas, as a foam, paste or powder or in a liquid state or in a gaseous state.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.8.3.0H">7.8.3.0</a> Emulsions<br>
 An emulsion is liquid dispersed in another liquid, e.g. mayonnaise, cream, milk.<br>
 An emulsion is the suspension of one liquid as fine droplets in another with which it does not mix.<br>
 Emulsions are colloidal systems with both the dispersed phase and the continuous phase are liquids, e.g. oil in water.<br>
 The droplets of a liquid remain suspended in another liquid.<br>
 Emulsions may be cloudy or opaque.<br>
 Emulsions are like suspensions, because they settle on standing.<br>
 A solid emulsion is a liquid dispersed in another solid, e.g. butter.<br>
 Emulsion: Continuous phase / outer phase, continuous "outside" liquid around second liquid having discontinuous droplets.<br>
 Emulsifying agents<br>
 Emulsifying agents: <a href="./foodgardens/Foodgardens4.html#4.6.8H">4.6.8</a> (Agriculture)<br>
 Emulsifying agents are used to keep the phases dispersed so that the droplets remain suspended and the emulsion remains stabilized.<br>
 When you shake two immiscible liquids, droplets of one liquid are dispersed in the other.<br>
 In temporary emulsions, e.g. kerosene in water or oil in water, there is no attraction between the two liquids.<br>
 The two phases will disperse in each other if shaken together, but will separate on standing.<br>
 However, by adding an emulsifying agent, e.g. soap, the two liquids, kerosene and water, will remain dispersed within each other.<br>
<a name="MilkH">Milk</a><br> 
Milk is a poor emulsion.<br>
The forces of cohesion between the emulsified cream droplets are greater than the forces of adhesion between the milk and the cream, so the cream floats above the milk.<br>
In homogenized milk, the droplets have been broken into smaller particles and dispersed to form one phase.<br>

 Bile salts are emulsifying agents and reducers of surface tension so that fat particles remain suspended long enough for enzymes to digest them before absorption into the bloodstream.<br>
 Bile salts are sold as sodium tauroglycocholate.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.8.3.6H">7.8.3.6</a> Prepare bean curd, (tofu, soya bean)<br>
 Weigh 50 g of moth free and mildew free soybeans and put them in a 500 mL beaker.<br>
 Add 300 mL water to soak for 24 hours to make the soybeans fully swell.<br>
 Replace the water if the atmospheric temperature is high.<br>
 Then pour out the water.<br>
 Grind the soaked soybeans in 200 mL water by using a household grinder.<br>
 To make soybean milk, transfer the soybean slurry to a filter fitted with two pieces of filter cloth, and filter by suction.<br>
 Wash the filter cake many times with 100 mL water to extract the soybean milk fully from the bean dregs.<br>
 The filtrate obtained is concentrated soybean milk.<br>
 Pour the concentrated soybean milk (or alternatively use industrial concentrated soybean milk in bags), into a clean 500 mL beaker and heat to about 80<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 Add saturated gypsum aqueous solution to the hot soybean milk.<br>
 Stir constantly until white wads appear.<br>
 Stop heating and let the soybean milk stand for five minutes.<br>
 Solid lumps start to separate out of the bean milk.<br>
 After standing for about 20 minutes, filter the solidified lumps from the bean milk.<br>
 Gather the lumps and shape them into a cube folded up in the filter cloth.<br>
 Place the cube on a clean plate and press it by putting a small beaker containing cold water on it.<br>
 About 30 minutes later, a cake of bean curd forms.<br>
 The bean curd will be whiter and more tender if concentrated soybean milk is used.<br>
 To preserve the freshly made bean curd from deterioration for a few days, soak it in 2-5% table salt aqueous solution and keep it in a cool, shady place.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.8.4.0H">7.8.4.0</a> Foams<br>
 Foams are solutions of gases in solids or liquids.<br>
 Foams, e.g. foam rubber, expanded polystyrene, have been stabilized with surfactants (surface acting agents), e.g. detergents.<br>
 A foam is gas dispersed in a liquid, e.g. foam on beer, whipped cream, fire extinguisher foam.<br>
 A solid foam is gas dispersed in a solid, e.g. marshmallow, foam rubber mattress, upholstery, expanded plastics (foamed plastics), e.g. Styrofoam and other polymer rigid foam articles.<br>
 A foam is a sort of cellular solid with a gas matrix.<br>
 Solid foams are often highly flammable.<br>
Experiments<br>
 1. Put bubble bath solution into a container of water and beat strongly until some foam forms.<br>
 Here a gas is dispersed in a liquid.<br>
 2. Beat or whisk some cream (emulsion), until it becomes whipped cream foam.<br>
 3. Dissolve a packet of household jelly crystals in one cup of hot water.<br>
 Cool and when the jelly is partially set, beat until frothy.<br>
 Whip the mixture with one cup of chilled evaporated milk until the mixture is stiff.<br>
 Add 2 tablespoons of lemon juice.<br>
 Whip the mixture again.<br>
 Fold this into the jelly gradually.<br>
 Pour into pie crust and refrigerate for 3 hours.<br>
 You can eat this foam colloid!<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.8.5.0H">7.8.5.0</a> Gels<br>
 1. Gels are colloids in which liquids are dispersed in solids to form a jelly.<br>
 They are semi-rigid systems, between the liquid state and the solid state, that consist of random networks of colloidal fibres or crystals, with liquid in the spaces.<br>
 Gels are colloidal systems that have set.<br>
 Some gels can lose one component by heating to leave a solid, e.g. silica gel.<br>
 Hydrogels have insoluble chains of polymers in a network that can contain very high concentrations of water.<br>
 They can be used for breast implants, water holding granules for dry soils, burn dressings, baby nappies (diapers), sanitary napkins, contact lenses and water sensors.<br>
 Environmentally sensitive hydrogels can be used to detect specific concentrations of substances or temperature or pH then release the substances they are carrying.<br>
 Hydrogels include acrylate polymers, polyvinyl alcohol, sodium polyacrylate and natural hydrogels, e.g. methyl cellulose and may have thixotropy, i.e. become fluid when disturbed, but solidify at rest, e.g. 
 hair gels.<br>
 2. Gels are colloids with a three dimensional structure of a network of linked molecules, e.g. gelatine, jelly, silica gel.<br>
 Gels easily change their shape under pressure, but may flow under high pressure.<br>
 Gels form when colloidal solutions are left standing to allow a 3 dimensional network to form.<br>
 Collagen is denatured by heat to form separate molecules called gelatine that form an amorphous network when cooled.<br>
 When gelatine is dissolved in water, it forms chemical bonds with the water and acts as a semi-solid or gel, jelly.<br>
 The gel can "dissolve" when heated and then form again when cooled again.<br>
 When the proteins in egg white are denatured by heating, they form a permanent gel that does not "dissolve" when heated.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.8.7.0H">7.8.7.0</a> Sols<br>
 1. Sols are colloidal solutions, suspensions of solid or liquid particles of colloidal dimensions in a liquid.<br>
 So sols are dispersions of small groups of molecules in a medium.<br>
 Sols remain dispersed, because Brownian movement prevents the groups of molecules precipitating under the influence of gravity.<br>
 2. Aerosols are solutions of solid or liquid particles in a gas, e.g. smoke, fog.<br>
 3. Lyophilic sols (solvent-loving sols), are more like solutions and are stable, e.g. starch in water, have large dispersed particles with an affinity with the medium.<br>
 Hydrophilic sols are the water loving sols.<br>
 Lyophilic sols are easily dispersed in certain mediums and may be redispersed after coagulation.<br>
 The particles of some protein solutions have a chemical shell of water molecules around them that prevents them flocculating unless a strong salt solution is added to precipitate the colloid.<br>
 4. Lyophobic sols (hydrophobic sols, solvent hating sols, water hating sols), are difficult to disperse into an unstable solution and cannot be reformed after coagulation.<br>
 They can form precipitates, because they have a dispersed phase with no affinity with the medium, e.g. silver chloride precipitates in photography.<br>
 The particles keep apart, because of their electrical charge, but eventually they precipitate.<br>
 5. Xanthan gum, vegetable gum food additive, E415, from corn sugar (maize), fermentation, e.g. maize, by <i>Xanthomonas campestris</i>, forms stable viscous sols.<br>
