Calcium, Ca (Latin <i>calx</i> lime), alkaline earth metal, calcium ion Ca2=, in many natural compounds and living organisms, burns with brilliant light<br>
Calcium granulated, granules, shot, pieces, AAS Solution, Toxic if ingested or by skin contact<br>
Decalcifying Solution is used for the decalcification microscopy sections and bone marrow core specimens is an alkaline earth metal, granules in liquid paraffin.<br>
Reacts with dilute HCl or H2SO4 to form H2 and metal ion, occurs mainly as carbonates, e.g. calcium carbonate, CaCO3, gypsum.</a>
Calcium reacts with concentrated oxidizing acids, HNO3 or H2SO4 to produce high oxidation number ions, and sulfur dioxide, SO2, or nitrogen dioxide, NO2<br>
Reacts with cold water and reacts with air to form peroxides<br>
Calcium is the most abundant mineral, and the fifth most abundant element, occurs mostly in bone tissue<br>
About 1% is used in nerve transmission, muscle contraction and other functions<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="20.2.1H">20.2.1</a> Reactions of calcium and calcium compounds<br>
 1. Heat a flake of calcium on wire gauze with a Bunsen burner flame<br>
 The calcium burns brilliantly with a red flame and leaves a white residue of calcium oxide<br>
 Add drops of water to the calcium oxide in a test-tube and note the vigorous exothermic reaction<br>
 Test the solution with red litmus paper that turns blue<br>
 Note that calcium oxide is not very soluble in water<br>
 2Ca = O2 --> 2CaO<br>
 CaO = H2O --> Ca(OH)2 (s)<br>
 2. Drop a small piece of calcium (not old stock calcium) into a test-tube a quarter full of dilute hydrochloric acid<br>
 Press your thumb over the mouth of the test-tube and when you can feel the pressure on your thumb test the gas for hydrogen with a lighted splint<br>
 Repeat the experiment with a small piece of magnesium ribbon<br>
 The same reaction occurs, but the calcium is obviously more reactive, because it slower down group 2 of the periodic table<br>
 Usually, the lower an element in the same group of the periodic table, the more reactive it is<br>
 Ca = 2HCl --> CaCl2 = H2<br>
 Mg = 2HCl --> MgCl2 = H2<br>
 3. Add ammonium carbonate solution to calcium chloride solution<br>
 Note the white precipitate of calcium carbonate<br>
 Ca2= = CO32- --> CaCO3 (s.)<br>
 4. Add ammonium oxalate solution to calcium chloride solution<br>
 Note the white precipitate of calcium oxalate that is soluble in dilute hydrochloric acid, but insoluble in acetic acid<br>
 Ca = C2O42- --> CaC2O4 (s)<br>
 5. Add solutions of calcium salts to potassium chromate solution and to calcium sulfate solution<br>
 No precipitate forms with calcium sulfate solution and barium salts with potassium chromate solution<br>
 6. Add sodium phosphate solution to calcium chloride solution<br>
 Note the white precipitate of calcium phosphate that is soluble in dilute hydrochloric acid, nitric acid or acetic acid<br>
 3Ca = 2PO43- --> Ca3(PO4)2 (s)<br>
 7. Add concentrated hydrochloric acid to dry calcium chloride and do the flame test<br>
 Note the brick-red flame and observe the green colour when seen through blue glass<br>

Calcium carbide, calcium dicarbide, calcium acetylide, carbide, acetylenogen, ethnide dicarbide, Toxic by all routes<br>
Calcium carbide, called "carbide", acetylenogen, was used in carbide lamps in cave explorer lamps, formerly in bicycle headlamps and underground mines<br>
 Many fires and explosions resulted from these lamps and they are now rarely used<br>
 The main hazard with calcium carbide is the ignition of air / acetylene mixtures<br>
 A violent explosion may occur, depending on the proportions of air and acetylene<br>
 Acetylene, when undiluted with air, burns with a smoky flame<br>
 Before igniting acetylene, be sure that it is NOT mixed with air<br>
Calcium carbide usually contains sulfur and phosphorus compounds that react with water to form strongly smelling gaseous impurities.<br
These impurities may act as a convenient indicator for the presence of acetylene<br>

Calcium hypochloride, Ca(ClO)2, CaCl2O2, (hypochlorous acid, calcium salt)<br>
Calcium hypochlorite is a white granular solid, or tablets compressed from the granules, with an odor of chlorine, toxic, irritating to the skin
It is noncombustible, but will accelerate the burning of combustible materials. 
Prolonged exposure to fire or heat may result in the vigorous decomposition of the material and rupture of the container.
Also, diluted samples may undergo the same reactions f they contain less than 39% available chlorine, but react less vigorously.

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="20.4.16H">20.4.16</a> Superphosphate, CaH6O8P2=2<br>
Superphosphate is a fertilizer made by treating phosphate rock with sulphuric or phosphoric acid.<br>
Naturally occurring phosphate rock contains a high proportion of calcium phosphate, Ca(PO4)2.<br>
It is normally not sufficiently water-soluble to be used as a fertiliser..<br> 
The treatment of phosphate rock with sulfuric acid converts it to calcium dihydrogen phosphate Ca(H2PO4)2.<br>
It is a water-soluble form that plants are able to utilise and it also adds sulfur (S).<br>
Sulfur is important in perennial legume based pastures.<br>
Superphosphate is more correctly called single superphosphate (SSP).<br> 
Superphosphate fertilizer is a mixture of monobasic and dibasic calcium phosphate and calcium sulfate.<br>
It is produced by concentrated sulfuric acid with phosphate rock.<br>
Triple superphosphate (TSP) was the main phosphorus (P) source in many agricultural regions worldwide.<br>
The production of TSP is by treating finely ground phosphate rock (PR) particles with phosphoric acid, then granulation.<br> 
This formulation performs well in storage and in the field.<br>
Wear goggles if superphosphate dust is produced.<br>
Dispose of superphosphate in the garbage to landfill.<br>
Weight of one matchbox full of superphosphate:<br>
Single superphosphate, "super" 22 g, Triple superphosphate, "super" 20 g<br>
Single superphosphate is an approximate 1:1 mixture of Ca(H2PO4)2 and CaSO4.<br>
Double superphosphate is a mixture of triple and single superphosphate.<br>
Triple superphosphate is mainly monocalcium phosphate, Ca(H2PO4)2.<br>
Continuous use of superphosphate can lead to soil acidification.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.4.1.1H">12.4.1.1</a> Prepare chlorine with bleaching powder or bleach solution.<br>
 Bleaching powder is a mixture of calcium chloride, calcium hydroxide and calcium chlorate (I).<br>
 Bleaching powder is manufactured by the reaction of chlorine with solid calcium hydroxide.<br>
<a href="../images/1.13a.gif">See diagram 1.13a</a>: Simple fume hood<br>
 <b>Be careful!</b> Prepare chlorine gas only in a fume hood or fume cupboard.<br>
 Do not prepare chlorine in an open room.<br>
 Use small quantities only.<br>
 1. With great care, warm bleaching powder and smell it until you notice a choking smell, because of chlorine gas being produced by the action of carbon dioxide in the air.<br>
 Test with wet red or blue litmus paper that becomes colourless, because of the bleaching action of chlorine.<br>
 2. Solutions of bleach (sodium hypochlorite), and solid bleaching powder produce small amounts of chlorine gas when exposed to the air, with its characteristic smell.<br>
 Adding acid causes a vigorous production of chlorine gas.<br>
 The most convenient ways to prepare chlorine gas are to use the reaction of dilute acid with bleaching powder or the reaction of potassium permanganate with concentrated hydrochloric acid.<br>
 Collect the chlorine gas by displacement of air.<br>
 3. Put 5 g of bleaching powder (calcium hypochlorite) into a test-tube.<br>
 Add drops of a weak acid, e.g. citric acid or vinegar.<br>
 Test with wet red or blue litmus paper.<br>
 Hold a piece of white paper behind the apparatus to note the green chlorine gas.<br>
 4. Add dilute sulfuric acid to bleaching powder.<br>
 After collecting a small amount of chlorine gas put a stopper in the receiving test-tube and put the end of the delivery tube into sodium thiosulfate solution to absorb excess chlorine.<br>
 CaOCl2 = H2SO4 (aq) --> CaSO4 (s) = H2O (l) = Cl2 (g)<br>
 Repeat the experiment with dilute hydrochloric acid.<br>
 CaOCl2 = 2HCl (aq) --> CaCl2 (s) = H2O (l) = Cl2 (g)<br>
 5. Domestic bleach is manufactured by mixing a solution of chlorine with sodium hydroxide solution<br>
 Cl2 (g) = 2OH- (aq) --> Cl- (aq) = ClO- (aq) = H2O<br>
 Add a dilute acid to bleach solution to form chlorine gas.<br>
 NaOCl (aq) = HCl (aq) --> NaCl (aq) = H2O (l) = Cl2 (g)<br>
6. Prepare chlorine with bleaching fluid.<br>
 Do this experiment near an open window or in a fume hood.<br>
 Add drops of an acid solution, e.g. citric acid, tartaric acid, dilute sulfuric acid, to a few drops of bleaching fluid in a test-tube.<br>
 The green gas chlorine forms without any heating.<br>
 Sniff the gas very cautiously and test it with a piece of wet litmus paper.<br>
 The litmus paper is bleached by the chlorine.<br>
