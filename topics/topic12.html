<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.2.04H">12.2.04</a> Types of chemical reactions<br>
 Chemical reactions involve energy changes.<br>
 All chemical reactions involve energy transformations.<br>
 The spontaneous directions of chemical reactions are towards lower energy and greater randomness.<br>
 In a chemical reaction, a chemical change occurs where elements or compounds (reactants) form new substances (products).<br>
 Specific criteria can be used to classify chemical reactions.<br>
 Neutralization reactions are reactions producing an aqueous solution with equal concentrations of hydroxyl and hydrogen ions.<br>
 Redox reactions are reactions where one species is oxidized and another species is reduced.<br>
 Reversible reactions occur together with their converse to form an equilibrium mixture of reactants and products.<br>
 The main types of chemical reactions are as follows:<br>
 1. A + B --> AB<br>
 A + B --> AB synthesis<br>
 A + O --> AO oxidation, combustion<br>
 AB + 2O --> AO + BO<br>
 2. AB --> A + B<br>
 AB --> A + B decomposition, thermal decomposition, reduction.<br>
 3. A + BC --> AC + B<br>
 A + BC --> AC + B single replacement, precipitation<br>
 copper + silver nitrate --> silver + copper nitrate<br>
 chlorine + sodium iodide --> sodium chloride + iodine<br>
 2A + BC --> BA + CA oxidation.<br>
4. AB + CD --> AD + CB<br>
 AB + CD --> AD + CB double replacement (displacement, metathesis), neutralization<br>
 copper + silver nitrate --> silver + copper nitrate<br>
 chlorine + sodium iodide --> sodium chloride + iodine<br>
 HCL + NaOH --> H2O + NaCL<br>
 lead nitrate + potassium iodide --> lead iodide + potassium nitrate<br>
 precipitation<br>
 AB (aq) + CD (aq) --> AD (aq) + CB (s)<br>
 Combustion reaction<br>
 CxHy + O2 --> CO2 + H2O<br>
 methane + Oxygen --> CO2 + H2O<br>
 Hydrolysis reaction<br>
 X + H2O --> HX + OH.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.2.1H">12.2.1</a> Acid-base reactions<br>
 Acid-base reactions involve transfer of protons from donors to acceptors.<br>
 An acid dissociates in water to produce positive hydrogen ions, H+, that is solvated to produce hydronium ions (hydroxonium ions,<br>
 oxonium ions) H3O+, by transferring a proton (H+) to a water molecule.<br>
 HCl (g) + H2O (l) --> H3O+ (aq) + Cl- (aq)<br>
 A base dissociates in water to produce negative hydroxide ions, OH-.<br>
 NaOH --> Na+ (aq) + OH- (aq)<br>
 Acids react with bases to from salts and water.<br>
 The products are neither acidic nor basic so this reaction is called neutralization.<br>
 HCl + NaOH --> NaCl + H2O<br>
 hydrochloric acid + sodium hydroxide --> sodium chloride + water<br>
 The ionic equation that shows all the substances:<br>
 H3O+ (aq) + Cl- (aq) + Na+ (aq) + OH- (aq) --> 2H2O + Na+ (aq) + Cl- (aq)<br>
 The net ionic equation<br>
 H3O+ (aq) + OH- (aq) --> 2H2O.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.2.2H">12.2.2</a> Decomposition reactions<br>
Decomposition reactions<br>
A compound breaks down into simpler compounds or into elements, usually caused by heat, the opposite of a synthesis reaction.<br>
All compounds decompose on heating to a high enough temperature to form elements or simple molecules.<br>
In a decomposition reaction a compound is broken into smaller chemical species.<br>
A decomposition reaction may be thought of as the breakdown of a single phase, a molecule or a reaction intermediate into two or more phases.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.2.3H">12.2.3</a> Displacement reactions, (substitution reactions)<br>
 The reactants are an element and a compound.<br>
 In the reaction displacement of Cu2+ by zinc<br>
 The element replaces part of the compound with the same valence and same sign.<br
 Zn (s) + CuSO4 (aq) --> ZnSO4 (aq) + Cu (s)<br>
 zinc + copper sulfate --> zinc sulfate + copper<br>
 The copper precipitates as the element and the zinc metal goes into solution as zinc ions.<br>

<a href="#12.2.4.02H">12.2.4.02</a> Coloured precipitates, double decomposition reactions<br>
Double replacement reactions, double exchange reactions, metathesis, double decomposition reactions, precipitation reactions, neutralization reactions<br>
 Metathesis occurs when radicals are exchanged.<br>
 A reaction between ions is shown by precipitation of an insoluble salt as a solid.<br>
 Use (aq) to show a solution and use (s) to show a precipitate, solid.<br>
 AgNO3 (aq) + HCl (aq)--> HNO3 (aq) + AgCl (s)<br>
 Metathesis is a chemical reaction between two substances that produces two other substances with either ionic or covalent bonds.<br>
 AB + CD --> AC + BD<br>
 The above reaction may also be called a double decomposition reaction (metathesis), because the positive and negative parts of two compounds swap partners,<br>
 i.e. exchange radicals.<br>
 It can occur if one of the products (substances formed) is insoluble or is a gas.<br>
 However, some people think a double decomposition reaction is similar, except one of the substances does not dissolve in the solvent<br>
 AB (aq) + CD (s) --> AD (aq) + CB (s)<br>
 Precipitation reactions result in the appearance of a solid from reactants in aqueous solution.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.3.1H">12.3.1</a> Properties of acids<br>
An acid is a good electrolyte, reacts with active metals, turns blue litmus red and has a sour taste, (Latin, acidus, sour tasting).<br>
 Acids contain hydrogen replaceable by metals.<br>
 Acids neutralize alkalis and alkalis neutralize acids.<br>
 Acids are sour corrosive, mainly liquids, that can dissolve metals.<br>
 Acids with water produce hydrogen ions, H+.<br>
 An acid is a proton donor (H+) (Bronsted-Lowry definition).<br>
 Acids can donate protons or accept pairs of electrons.<br>
 The "acid test" was originally the nitric acid test for gold, because only gold would not dissolve in it.<br>
 To acidify is to add acid to usually a solution.<br>
 Acidic substance have pH &lt; 7.<br>
 An acid salt is formed by an acid where incomplete exchange of replaceable hydrogen occurs.<br>
 An acid dye is a dye that is a metallic salt of an acid and can be applied in an acid medium.<br>
 Dilute acids contain hydrogen ions in aqueous solution.<br>
 You can represent the hydrogen ion, which is really a proton, in different ways to show how it is related to the water molecules in the solution.<br>
 You can show it as the hydrated hydrogen ion, [proton, H+ (aq)] or as the hydronium ion [oxonium ion, H3O+(aq)]<br>
 For convenience, use H+ (aq).<br>
 Concentrated sulfuric acid exists mainly as H2SO4 molecules.<br>
 Hydrochloric acid and nitric acid dissociate into ions even in concentrated solution.<br>
 Weak acids, e.g. ethanoic acid (acetic acid, CH3COOH, carbonic acid and sulfurous acid dissociate very little in aqueous solution.<br>
 However, their salts, e.g. potassium acetate CH3COOK are completely dissociated into ions.<br>
 Using the Bronsted-Lowry definition of acids and bases:<br>
 an acid donates a proton (H+) to another substance and a base accepts a proton from another substance.<br>
 When sulfuric acid dissociates in water it donates a proton (H+) to the water molecule.<br>
 So in this reaction the water molecule acts as a base.<br>
 H2SO4 + H2O --> HSO4- + H3O+<br>
When ammonia dissolves in water, ammonia accepts a proton and so it is the base.<br>
 So in this reaction the water molecule acts as an acid.<br>
 NH3 + H2O --> NH4+ + OH-.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.3.2H">12.3.2</a> Acid dissociation constant, Ka<br>
Acid dissociation constant, Ka or Acidity constant or Acid-ionization constant or " Dissociation constant"<br>
 The acid dissociation constant, Ka of the acid HB:<br>
 HB (aq) --> H+ (aq) + B- (aq)<br>
 Ka = [H+][B-] / [HB]<br>
 Ka is a measure of the degree to which an acid or base will dissociate in water.<br>
 Stronger acids have a larger Ka and a smaller pKa than weaker acids.<br>
 The greater the value of Ka, the more the formation of H+ is favoured, and the lower the pH of the solution.<br>
 1. The acid dissociation constant, Ka, measures the strength of an acid in solution.<br>
 2. An acid, HA, dissociates into A-, conjugate base, and H+, hydrogen ion (proton).<br>
 The equilibrium equation when concentrations do not change is: HA --> A- + H+.<br>
 3. Dissociation refers to the break up of a molecule into smaller molecules, atoms or ions.<br>
 In a buffer solution of the salt of a weak acid with a weak acid, the dissociation of the weak acid is negligible, but a salt may be dissociated completely into ions.<br>
 4. The dissociation constant, Ka, is the equilibrium constant of reversible dissociation including the ionization reactions of acids and bases in water.<br>
 The dissociation constant Ka = [A-] [ H+] / [HA] in mol / litre.<br>
 5. However, dissociation is usually expressed as a logarithmic constant, pKa, where pKa = -log10 (1/Ka)<br>
 It is the quotient of the equilibrium concentrations, in mol/L for ionization reactions at 25oC.<br>
 For pKa, the larger the value the weaker the acid, so strong acids have pKa &lt; 2, and weak acids have pKa &gt;2, &lt; 12.<br>
 6. Confusion occurs, because both Ka and pKa are both called "acid dissociation constant".<br>

 Amphoteric substances can act as an acid or a base.<br>

The product of hydrogen ion concentration, [H+] and hydroxide ion concentration, [OH-] = the constant, Kw.<br>
Kw = [H+] × [OH-] = 1.00 × 10-14<br>
So [H+] = 10-7 and [OH-] = 10-7<br>
The hydrogen ion concentration is very small in pure water, so the concentration is describes in terms of its negative log.<br>
pH is the negative log of the hydrogen ion concentration, pH = -log[H+], so hydrogen ion concentration, [H+] = 10-pH.<br>
So acidic solutions have a high [H+] and low pH values.<br>
Basic solutions have low [H+] and high pH values.<br>
A solution that is neither acidic nor basic, a neutral solution, has [H+] = [OH-], so pH = 7.<br>

 In the reaction of dilute hydrochloric acid on magnesium ribbon, each magnesium atom loses two electrons to two hydrogen atoms.<br>
 Mg (s) + HCl (aq) --> MgCl2 (aq) + H2 (g)<br>
 Mg (s) + 2H3O+ (aq) + 2Cl- (aq) --> H2 (g) + Mg2+ (aq) + 2Cl- (aq) + 2H2O.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.2.6.2H">12.2.6.2</a> Oxygen with sulfur dioxide<br>
 In reactions where no ions form, use the idea of oxidation number (oxidation state) to show the "apparent charge" on an atom.<br>
 In the reaction between gases:<br>
 2SO2 (g) + O2 (g) --> 2SO3 (g)<br>
 Give the oxygen atom a net charge of -2, but give O2 a net charge of zero, because the oxygen atom is in the elemental form.<br>
 Then the sulfur atom in SO2 has an oxidation number +4 and the sulfur atom in SO3 has an oxidation number +6.<br>
 The sulfur atoms have been oxidized, because the oxidation number increased and the oxygen gas atoms in O2 reduced, because the oxidation number decreased.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.2.6.3H">12.2.6.3</a> Ammonia with copper oxide<br>
 Similarly, in the following equation:<br>
 NH3 + CuO --> Cu + H2O + N2<br>
 The oxidation number of hydrogen atom in NH3 is +1 and in H2 is zero, because the hydrogen atom is in the elemental form.<br>
 The oxidation number of the nitrogen atom has increased from -3 in NH3 to 0 in N2, because N in N2 is in the elemental form.<br>
 The oxidation number of the copper has decreased from +2 in CuO to zero in Cu, because the Cu atom is in elemental form.<br>
 The nitrogen atom has been oxidized and the copper atom has been reduced.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.2.6.4H">12.2.6.4</a> Chlorine with water<br>
 The disproportionation process occurs when a chemical species is oxidized and reduced simultaneously.<br>
 When chlorine has dissolves in water a disproportionation occurs:<br>
 The chlorine becomes both oxidized, when HClO is formed, and reduced, when HCl is formed.<br>
 Chlorine dissolving in water:<br>
 Cl2 (g) + H2O (l) --> HClO (aq) + Cl- (aq) + H+ (aq)<br>
 So the chlorine is both oxidized and reduced.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.2.6.5H">12.2.6.5</a> Copper (I) oxide with hot dilute sulfuric acid<br>
 Copper (I) ions in solution form a precipitate of copper and copper (II) ions, because disproportionation occurs.<br>
 So for 2Cu+ (aq), one ion is reduced to copper,<br>
 Cu+ (aq) --> Cu (s)<br>
 the other ion is oxidized.<br>
 Cu+ (aq) --> Cu2+ (aq)<br>
 In the reaction of copper (I) oxide with hot dilute sulfuric acid, a solution of copper (I) sulfate and water does not form.<br>
 Instead a brown precipitate of copper and a blue solution of copper (II) sulfate forms, because of disproportionation.<br>
 2Cu+ (aq) --> Cu2+ (aq) + Cu (s).<br>

<a href="../images/3.2.83ch.gif">See diagram 3.2.83:</a> Temperature rise of the reacting solution.<br>
 1. Put 25 mL of 0.2 M copper (II) sulfate solution in a 100 mL plastic bottle fitted with a one-hole stopper and thermometer.<br>
 Replace the stopper, invert the bottle and shake it gently.<br>
 Record the temperature of this solution.<br>
 Turn the bottle the right way up, remove the stopper and add 0.5 g of zinc dust.<br>
 The quantity of zinc powder is in excess to ensure that all the copper (II) sulfate is used up in the reaction, so some zinc will remain when the reaction stops.<br>
 Replace the stopper, invert the bottle, and shake gently.<br>
 Record the highest temperature reached.<br>
 Calculate the rise of temperature.<br>
 This rise of temperature in not affected by the volume of 0.2 M copper (II) sulfate used for the experiment.<br>
 For a 1 M solution, multiply the rise in temperature by 5 (5 × 0.2M = 1.0 M).<br>
 The reactants lost energy to the solution.<br>
 The temperature change is usually between 9oC and 10oC.<br>
 Zn (s) + Cu2+ (aq) --> Zn2+ (aq) + Cu (s)<br>
 2. Repeat the experiment with 0.5 g of iron powder or iron filings.<br>
 This amount is again in excess so that all the copper (II) sulfate will be used up in the reaction.<br>
 The temperature change is usually between 6oC and 7oC.<br>
 The zinc metal became zinc ions and copper ions became copper metal, because of transfer of electrons from zinc metal to the copper ion.<br>
 To get electrical energy, these electrons must flow in an external conductor, e.g. a wire, from the zinc to the copper.<br>
 The potential or voltage will reflect the greater activity of zinc over copper.<br>
 The current flowing will depend on the extent and rate of the reaction.<br>
 3. Fix two lead foil strips in a beaker and add 200 mL of 1 mol per litre sulfuric acid.<br>
 Connect the lead electrodes to a power pack set at 2 V and switch it on for two minutes.<br>
 The lead strip connected to the positive terminal becomes covered with brown lead dioxide.<br>
 Disconnect the power pack and connect the lead strips to a torch battery.<br>
 The battery glows, but the brown leads dioxide on the positive terminal does not disappear.<br>
 Repeat the experiment with increasing charging times.<br>
 The time the battery glows increases with charging time up to 30 seconds then hardly changes.<br>
 Repeat the experiment with different charging voltages.<br>
 Different charging voltage makes hardly any difference in the time the battery glows.<br>
 However, at high charging voltages hydrogen is produced at the negative electrode and oxygen at the positive electrode.<br>
 Charging<br>
 At the positive electrode: Pb (s) + 2H2O (l) --> PbO2 (s) + 4H+ (aq) + 4e-<br>
 At the negative electrode: 2H+ (aq) + 2e- --> H2(g)<br>
 Also, lead reacts with the sulfuric acid to produce lead sulfate<br>
 At the positive electrode: PbSO4 (s) + 2H2O (l) --> PbO2 (s) + 4H+ (aq) + SO42- + 2e-<br>
 At the negative electrode: PbSO4 (s) + 2e- --> Pb (s) + SO42- (aq)<br>
 So sulfuric acid is produced during charging and is consumed during discharging.<br>
 As sulfuric acid has about twice the density of water, the density of the electrolyte shows the state of charge of the battery.<br>
 4. When the battery is fully charged, the specific gravity = 1.280, electrode A is lead and electrode, B is lead dioxide.<br>
 When the battery discharges, electrode A changes from lead to lead sulfate, electrode B changes from lead dioxide to lead sulfate, concentration of H2SO4 decreases.<br>
 When the battery is being charged, these processes are reversed.<br>
 The concentration of sulfuric acid suggests the state of charge of the battery so this concentration can be measured with a battery hydrometer.<br>
 Electrode A: Pb + SO42- --> PbSO4 + 2e-<br>
 Electrode B: PbO2 + 4H3O+ + SO42- + 2e- --> PbSO4 + 6H2O<br>
 In a motor car battery, the electrodes have a coat of lead (II) oxide (PbO) and lead powder (Pb).<br>
 In the electrolyte, electric current converts the PbO to Pb on the negative plate, and the PbO to lead (IV) oxide (lead peroxide) PbO2 on the positive plate.<br>
 Discharging --><br> 
 PbO2 + 2H2SO4 + Pb &lt; = &gt; 2PbSO4 + 2H2O<br>
 &lt;-- Charging<br>
 If you pass electricity through the battery after it is fully charged, "gassing" occurs, i.e. water is decomposed into hydrogen and oxygen gas.<br>
 Never smoke or allow a naked flame near a charging battery.<br>

<a href="../images/33.3.2a.gif">See diagram 33.3.2a</a>: Copper and zinc foil in a voltmeter, a simple cell.<br>
 1. Put concentrated copper (II) sulfate solution in a beaker.<br>
 Connect copper foil to the positive terminal, red wire, of a voltmeter and a zinc foil to the negative terminal, black wire.<br>
 Simultaneously dip the two metals briefly into the copper sulfate solution.<br>
 Record the readings on the voltmeter.<br>
 The voltage falls to zero after a short time, because black copper deposited on the zinc and caused the reaction to stop.<br>
 When copper deposits on the zinc electrode, it prevents more zinc from entering the solution.<br>
 This causes the voltage to fall to zero after a short time and the cell becomes "dead".<br>
 Separate the electrolytes to prevent the voltage fall by using 1. a Daniell Cell that has a porous pot, or 2. a salt bridge.<br>
 2. Pour concentrated copper (II) sulfate solution into a beaker.<br>
 Connect a copper rod to the positive terminal of a voltmeter and a zinc rod to the negative terminal.<br>
 Dip the two metals briefly into the copper (II) sulfate solution.<br>
 Zinc dissolves and hydrogen bubbles form on the surface of the copper.<br>
 The voltmeter reads 1.1 V, so electrons are moving from the zinc to the copper.<br>
