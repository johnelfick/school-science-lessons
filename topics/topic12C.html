Chlorine is a more powerful oxidizing agent than either bromine or iodine, so it can take electrons from both bromide ions and iodide ions.<br>
Bromine is a more powerful oxidizing agent than iodine, so it can remove electrons from iodide ions to give iodine.<br>
Oxidizing ability falls as you go down the Group, chlorine then bromine then iodine.<br>
Halogens get less reactive as the group is descended.<br>
The halogen molecule is the electron acceptor (the oxidizing agent) and is reduced by electron gain to form a halide ion.<br>
The halide ion is the electron donor (the reducing agent) and is oxidized by electron loss to form a halogen molecule.<br>

Put in water and carefully cut the rubber tubing to release the bromine.<br>
4. Prepare bromine water by adding a small volume of bromine to a large volume of water.<br>
The bromine dissolves to a limited extent, colouring the water yellow-orange.<br>
Use the relatively harmless bromine water to demonstrate reactions of bromine with various organic and inorganic materials.<br>
Reaction is shown by loss of colour from the solution.<br>
5. Mix 5 g of potassium bromide and 5 g of manganese dioxide in a 250 mL conical flask.<br>
Add 5 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid and seal with a cork fitted with a distillation tube.<br>
Heat with a Bunsen burner to distil the bromine into a 200 mL conical flask containing 50 mL of water.<br>

The litmus paper turns red and becomes bleached.<br>
3. Add drops of bromine water to 3 cm of sulfurous acid.<br>
Test the solution for sulfate by adding dilute hydrochloric acid, followed by barium chloride.<br>
SO3<sup>2-</sup> + Br2 + H2O --> SO4<sup>2-</sup>+ 2Br<sup>-</sup> + 2H<sup>+</sup>.<br>
4. Add drops of sodium hydroxide solution to 3 cm of bromine water until the colour disappears.<br>
The remaining solution contains the hypobromite ion, BrO<sup>-</sup>.<br>
2OH<sup>-</sup> + Br2 --> BrO<sup>-</sup> + Br<sup>-</sup> + H2O<br>
The hypobromite solution can precipitate manganese dioxide from manganese sulfate solution and precipitate lead dioxide from lead nitrate solution.<br>
5. Add 2 cc of red phosphorus to 3 cm of bromine water.<br>
Shake the mixture and leave to stand.<br>
Note that the colour of the bromine water disappears.<br>
The bromine and phosphorus combine and the resulting bromide of phosphorus decomposes to give phosphorous or phosphoric acids.<br>

2. Concentrated 880 ammonia: white ammonium bromide fumes form.<br>
NH3 + HBr --> NH4Br<br>
3. Litmus solution: Litmus turns red.<br>
4. Chlorine water: Yellow coloration, because of bromine.<br>
2Br<sup>-</sup> + Cl2 --> Br2 + 2Cl<sup>-</sup><br>
5. A drop of water: This may be removed and tested by dipping the rod into drops of silver nitrate solution in a test-tube.<br>
The positive reaction shows the high solubility of the gas in water.<br>
6. Concentrated nitric acid: The hydrogen bromide is rapidly oxidized to bromine.<br>
2HNO3 + 2HBr --> 2H2O + 2NO2 + Br2<br>
7. Attach a stopper with a delivery tube bent at right angles and heat strongly.<br>
Hold a piece of white paper behind the test-tube.<br>
Strong heat decomposes the hydrogen bromide into bromine and hydrogen gas.<br>
If the bromine is not easily visible, put in the bromine vapour a filter paper dipped in an alcoholic solution of fluorescein and let dry.<br>
The filter paper turns red, because of the formation of eosin.<br>

The term "bromination" may simply mean to combine a substance with bromine or a bromine compound.<br>
However, it may have a more complicated meaning in chemistry.<br>
In a fume cupboard, a solution of acetone in water + hydrochloric acid reacts with saturated bromine water to form bromoacetone and hydrogen bromide.<br>
The reaction goes through several stages.<br>
Bromoacetone is a poisonous tear gas and was used as such in the First World War.<br>
CH3COCH3 + Br2 --> CH3COCH2Br + HBr<br>
acetone + bromine --> bromoacetone + hydrogen bromide.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.19.9.8H"></a><h3>12.19.9.8 Reactions of 2-bromopropane with hydroxide ions, nucleophilic reactions</h3>
Heat 2-bromopropane in a reflux condenser with concentrated solution of sodium hydroxide in ethanol.<br>
1. Elimination reaction<br>
The hydroxide ion acts as a base to remove hydrogen as a hydrogen ion from the first carbon atom.<br>
This reaction expels the bromine as a bromide ion to form propene, leaving sodium ions, bromide ions and water.<br>
CH3CHBrCH3 + NaOH --> CH2=CHCH3 + NaBr + H2O<br>
2-bromopropane + sodium hydroxide --> propene + sodium bromide + water.<br>
2. Nucleophilic substitution reaction<br>
The nucleophilic -OH group replaces the bromine to form the alcohol propan-2-ol, leaving sodium ions and bromide ions.<br>
CH3CHBrCH3 + NaOH --> CH3CHOHCH3 + NaBr<br>
2-bromopropane + sodium hydroxide --> propan-2-ol + sodium bromide<br>
This example of nucleophilic substitution reaction is the hydrolysis of an alkyl bromide, R-Br, under alkaline conditions, where the attacking nucleophile is the OH<sup>-</sup>, leaving the group Br<sup>-</sup>.<br>
R-Br + OH<sup>-</sup> --> R-OH + Br<sup>-</sup><br>
The nucleophile OH<sup>-</sup> donates an electron pair to an electrophile, RBr.<br>
Nucleophiles are electron rich so they find electron deficient sites in an organic molecule, e.g. H2O, NH3, OH-, Cl-, Br-, CN<sup>-</sup>.<br>
The organic chemistry term nucleophile (nucleophilic reagent) forms a bond to its reaction partner (the electrophile) by donating an electron pair to it to form a chemical bond in the reaction.<br>

Be careful! Chlorine and bromine are harmful when inhaled or when they contact the skin.<br>
Fluorine, F, is a yellow gas.<br>
Chlorine, Cl, is a green gas.<br>
Bromine, Br, is a red-brown liquid.<br>
Iodine, I, is a grey-black crystal.<br>
All halogens are slightly soluble in water to form weak acidic solutions that are bleaches.<br>
Chlorine is the most soluble and the strongest bleach.<br>
Test each solution with universal indicator.<br>
Universal indicator turns red then is bleached.<br>
1. Compare the colours and states of the halogen elements at room temperature.<br>
At room temperatures fluorine is a pale yellow gas, chlorine is a green-yellow gas, bromine is a red-brown liquid that gives a brown vapour and iodine is a grey-black solid.<br>
2. Compare the colours, states and solubility in water of sodium fluoride, chloride, bromide and iodide.<br>
They are all soluble, white, crystalline solids.<br>
3. Compare the activity of fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine by investigating, which will displace another from their compounds.<br>
Prepare, sodium fluoride solution, sodium chloride solution, sodium bromide solution and sodium iodide solution.<br>
Add chlorine solution to each solution.<br>
Chlorine has no visible effect on sodium fluoride solution or sodium chloride solution.<br>
Chlorine turns sodium bromide solution brown-yellow.<br>
Chlorine turns sodium iodide solution deep brown.<br>
So chlorine displaces bromine from sodium bromide and chlorine displaces iodine from sodium iodide.<br>
However, chlorine does not displace fluorine from sodium fluoride.<br>
So chlorine is more active than bromine and iodine, but chlorine is less active than fluorine.<br>
4. Compare the colours and solubility of silver fluoride, chloride, bromide and iodide by adding silver nitrate solution to sodium fluoride solution, sodium chloride solution, sodium bromide solution<br> and sodium iodide solution.<br>
Silver fluoride is soluble.<br>
Silver chloride, silver bromide and silver iodide are insoluble.<br>
Silver chloride is white.<br>
Silver bromide is very pale yellow.<br>
Silver iodide is a deep yellow.<br>
