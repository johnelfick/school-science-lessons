Oleic acid has been found to increase good cholesterol and lower bad cholesterol<br>
Proponents of olive oil claim that in countries where oleic acid is the principle fat in the diet the people have the lowest incidence of heart disease and stroke.<br>
They have the longest life span, because olive oil is high in mono-unsaturated fats and low in both polyunsaturated and saturated fats.<br>
However, people living in different countries where the components of fats in their diets are almost identical may have different rates of the incidence of cancer.<br>
Olives are a remarkable source of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory phytonutrients.<br>
Most prominent are two simple phenols (tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol) and several terpenes (especially oleuropein, erythrodiol, uvaol),<br>

Osmium</a>, Os, (Greek <i>osmē</i> smell), refers to strong irritating smell of poisonous osmium tetroxide.<br>
Osmium is a silver-blue, very rare, very hard element, and possible the densest element, if not Iridium.<br>
It was discovered in 1803 by Smithson Tennant, England.<br>
Osmium tetroxide, OsO4, osmic acid, osmium oxide, osmium (VIII) oxide, solid, pungent unpleasant odour.<br>
It is extremely toxic.<br>
Not permitted in schools.<br>
Osmium was used in gramophone needles and fountain pen nibs, e.g. Osmiroid, because of extreme hardness and resistance to corrosion.<br>
Osmium, MP 3,054 oC, was formerly used in electric light filaments, e.g. "Osram", but was replaced by tungsten, MP, 3,407 oC.<br>
It is used in jewellery plating.<br>
Osmium tetroxide vapour forms black deposits with oil, so is used in finger printing.<br>

Oxygen, O (French <i>oxygène</i>), acidifying, oxygen was thought to be in all acids.<br>
Oxygen gas, O2, is a non-metal colourless and odourless gas at room temperature and pressure, 20.95% of the air, 47% of the earth's crust.<br>
It can be identified by lighting a glowing splint, it supports combustion and it is necessary for respiration.<br>
It is prepared in the laboratory by decomposition of hydrogen peroxide with MnO2 catalyst, but manufactured by distillation of liquid air.<br>
It is the most abundant element, 50% of mass of rocks in earth's crust.<br>
It reacts with metals to form basic oxides, and reacts with non-metals to form acidic oxides.<br>
Oxygen gas is stored compressed in cylinders for oxy-acetylene welding.<br>
Liquid oxygen, refrigerated oxygen, may explode with flammable or combustible substances, and may cause frostbite (cold burns), so use ventilated gloves!.<br>
Atomic number: 8, Relative atomic mass: 15.9994, RD 1.15 (90 K), MP = -218 oC, BP. = -183 oC<br>
Specific heat capacity: 916 J kg-1 K-1<br>
Oxygen concentrators:<br>
These devices avoid the need for resupply of oxygen using heavy gas cylinders.<br>
1. Pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen concentrators<br>
These devices force air at high pressure through zeolite minerals, which absorb nitrogen as a "nitrogen scrubber", leaving the rest of the atmospheric gases.<br>
They are used for small-scale oxygen generation in the homes of patients.<br>
2. Cryogenic separation oxygen concentrators are used for higher volume gas separation.<br>

 1. In 1773, Antoine Lavoisier (1743-1794, France), reported that when copper transformed into verdigris, the substance gained in weight.<br>
 This observation lead to the conclusion that "something" was being taken from the air.<br>
 In 1777, after further experiments, he named the "something" as the gas oxygen, (oxy gen, "generator of acid".<br>
 2. Verdigris is mostly basic copper carbonate, CuCO3CH(OH)2, the green colour of old coins from copper exposed to moist air.<br>
 Verdigris, [Cu(CH3CO2)2(H2O)], Cu(CH3CO2)2(CuO)(H2O)6, is harmful if ingested.<br>
 In moist sea air, copper chlorides may form.<br>
 The verdigris on bronze is called aerugo.<br>
 3. The green to green-blue pigment copper acetate used in old oil paintings is also called verdigris.<br>
 4. Acetic acid with copper oxide forms green-blue crystals of copper acetate, "crystallized verdigris".<br>
 It is used as a pesticide, pigment and for manufacture of <a href="../topics/topicIndexCaCh.html#CopperarseniteH">Paris green</a>.<br>
 5. Sodium sesquicarbonate can also be used as a water softener and to remove copper chloride verdigris from old copper vessels.<br>
 Experiment<br>
 By treating copper with acetic acid in the presence of air, a green-blue pigment forms called verdigris, i.e. impure copper acetate.<br>
 Put a piece of copper coin in a watch glass or saucer and pour drops of vinegar on to the surface of the copper.<br>
 Leave the copper undisturbed for hours, until the liquid has evaporated.<br>
 Blue-green particles of basic copper acetate are left on the surface of the coin.<br>
 Scrape these off on to a piece of white paper and wash the coin.<br>
 If the coin is an old, black copper oxide previously on the surface is removed, but black copper sulfide remains.<br>
 Basic copper acetate is used as a paint pigment, mordant and fungicide.<br>

Oxygen does not change the colour of moist litmus.<br>
1. The safest method to prepare oxygen is by decomposition of hydrogen peroxide solution.<br>
Hydrogen peroxide may be sold in two strengths 10 volumes (3% w/w) and 20 volumes (6% w/w).<br>
Pour some 20 volumes (vols) hydrogen peroxide into a test-tube containing manganese (IV) oxide granules as a catalyst and water.<br>

Store test-tubes of oxygen in a test-tube rack and remove the stoppers just before inserting the burning element.<br>
Be careful! This experiment may not be safe, because the decomposition reaction occurs quickly and water vapour shoots out of the container.<br>
Improve safety by using 44 micronmetre, particle size MnO2 instead of the smaller 10 micrometre particle size.<br>

6Fe + 4O2 --> 2Fe3O4<br>
3. Charcoal test for oxygen<br>
Fix charcoal into the loop in the lower end of the Nichrome wire or use a combustion spoon.<br>
Heat the charcoal in a Bunsen burner flame until it has a red glow, then quickly insert it into a test-tube of oxygen.<br>
The charcoal glows much more.<br>
C+ O2 --> CO2 (g)<br>
4. Magnesium ribbon test for oxygen<br>
<b> Be careful!</b> Do NOT look at the bright flame.<br>
Wrap a 3 cm piece of magnesium ribbon around the loop at the end of a wire.<br>
Ignite it in a Bunsen burner and put it quickly in the oxygen.<br>
Magnesium burns with a very bright flame.<br>
2Mg + O2 --> MgO (s)<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.5.0H">3.50</a> Prepare ozone gas<br>
<a href="../images/3.50ch.gif">See diagram 3.50</a>: Prepare ozone<br>
Ozone, O3, Highly toxic, pale blue gas, with a distinct pungent odour, like weak chlorine<br>
It is a powerful oxidizing agent that irritates the lungs.<br>
Ozone is formed in the atmosphere by the action of ultraviolet light with oxygen to form the ozone layer.<br>
You may smell ozone in underground train tunnels if electric sparks had occurred between the power rail and the electrical pickup shoe.<br>
Ozone may be smelt around photocopiers, e.g. Rank Xerox, and laser printers, if they are not well ventilated.<br>
However, manufacturers of these products claim that ozone can be smelt in concentrations as little as one part in 500, 000, while the threshold limit value for short term exposure is 0.3 parts per million.<br>
Small concentrations of ozone are used as an air freshener / sanitizer in public facilities and rest rooms to destroy atmospheric germs and odours.<br>
Ozone was discovered by Christian Schönbein (1799-1868) who noticed an unusual smell around electrical experiments.<br>
So he named the gas using the Greek word: to smell, ozein.<br>
Previously it was thought that the seaside smelt of ozone, but this smell probably comes from rotting seaweed.<br>
Oaks and willows are said to emit ozone to deter vegetation near them.<br>
The ozone layer is in the stratosphere, 20 to 40 km above the Earth absorbs some of the ultraviolet light that causes skin cancer.<br>
Ozone is produced with oxides of nitrogen by reactions of car exhaust gases with unburned fuel and sunlight to produce photochemical smog.<br>
After a thunderstorm, the refreshing smell is ozone and nitrogen oxides.<br>
1. Prepare ozone in the laboratory using a high voltage induction coil, spark coil (an ozonizer).<br>
However, the experiment is dangerous!<br>
Do not attempt it in a school laboratory.<br>
3O2 (g) --> 2O3 (g)<br>
2. Use electrolysis of 4 M sulfuric acid with carbon anodes.<br>
Pass 12 volts through the circuit and note the smell of ozone at the anode.<br>
3. In the upper stratosphere, ozone forms when ultraviolet (UV) light splits an oxygen gas molecule, O2, into two atoms of oxygen, O.<br>
O2 + UV --> O + O<br>
The oxygen atoms can react with other oxygen molecules to produce ozone that sinks down to the lower stratosphere, between 20 and 40 km above the Earth.<br>
O + O2 --> O3.<br>
Also, the oxygen atoms can react with ozone to produce oxygen molecules again.<br>
O + O3 --> O2 + O2<br>
When ozone absorbs UV light, the ozone breaks into an oxygen molecule and an oxygen atom again<br>
O3 + UV --> O2 + O<br>
