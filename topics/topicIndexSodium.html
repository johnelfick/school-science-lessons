Sodium, Na, metal (natrium), pellets (in liquid paraffin), cube, AAS solution, toxic if ingested, harmful, Corrosive, FLAM, COR 1428<br>
Sodium, Na (Latin, <i>Sodanum barilla</i>, plant burned to extract sodium), is a silver-white, alkali metal, very reactive with sodium chloride in sea water.<br>
Sodium, is a soft metal, which readily tarnishes in air. .<br>
Direct union of the elements occurs, sodium and chlorine.<br>
Sodium, Na (in liquid paraffin) (natrium), very reactive, soft and shiny alkali metal, silvery colour, 2.5% of the earth's crust in many different minerals.<br>
It does not occur in the free state and soon becomes dull in air.<br>
It is available as sodium metal in liquid paraffin, extracted by electrolysis of fused sodium hydroxide, rock salt (halite) and evaporated sea water.<br>
It is used in sodium vapour discharge lamps.<br>
Sodium reacts with dilute hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid to form hydrogen and metal ion.<br>
Sodium reacts with concentrated oxidizing acids, nitric acid or sulfuric acid to produce high oxidation number ions, and sulfur dioxide or nitrogen dioxide.<br>
Sodium reacts with cold water and reacts with air to form peroxides.<br>
Sodium has greater concentration in extra cellular fluids than in intracellular fluids.<br>
The level of sodium ion in blood is 310 to 333 mg per 100 mL of serum.<br>
Sodium metal reacts violently with water to form highly corrosive sodium hydroxide and hydrogen gas.<br>
The surface of the reacting sodium may become sufficiently hot to ignite the hydrogen and explode the air / hydrogen mixture.<br>
Sodiu reacts explosively with acids, bromides, iodine, sulfur, polyhalogenated hydrocarbons, e.g. chloroform.<br>
The surface of sodium metal is coated with a mixture of the oxide and hydroxide, both of which hygroscopic.<br>
This causes the surface of sodium metal to absorb moisture from the air, resulting in further reaction to form hydrogen and sodium hydroxide.<br>
Sodium metal, unprotected in a container, may absorb sufficient moisture to form an air / hydrogen mixture and then becomes hot enough to ignite the mixture.<br>
The ignition may cause an explosion, so store sodium under paraffin oil or kerosene.<br>
Store sodium on a low shelf to reduce the chance of dropping the container.<br>
Cut sodium on a clean dry surface with a clean dry blade, e.g. an all metal scalpel or small knife, not a scalpel with detachable blade.<br>
Do not lose small pieces of cut sodium.<br>
Dispose of sodium waste by reacting it with ethanol or methylated spirit in a beaker in a fume cupboard.<br>
The reaction of sodium with an alcohol is less violent than with water, so it is relatively slow and easy to control, but there is still a risk of fire.<br>
The use of flammable solvents near sodium is always a risk.<br>

Soda lime is prepared by dissolving calcium oxide with sodium hydroxide solution, then drying the products.<br>
Its reaction is milder than sodium hydroxide, so is used to avoid violent reactions.<br>
Also, CaO is used with sodium hydroxide to keep it dry because sodium hydroxide is hygroscopic.<br>
Tests for CO2, (if off-white: active, if violet: exhausted).<br>
For anaesthetics, the pH indicator ethyl violet is added to tell whether the soda lime can still absorb carbon dioxide.<br>

2. The following experiments use a test-tube to observe the reaction of sodium with water, but some teachers use a beaker 
full of water instead to avoid problems of confining the reaction in a test-tube.<br>
Cover the beaker with wire gauze immediately after adding the sodium.<br>
Do not try to hold the sodium in place on the surface of the water to collect the hydrogen produced because the gas may ignite or explode.<br>
A safe way of demonstrating the reactions of sodium and water is to drop a very small piece of sodium into a swimming pool, and stand back!.<br>
3. Pour a 2 cm layer of kerosene on to the surface of water in a test-tube.<br>
Drop a 3 mm diameter side cube of sodium into the kerosene.<br>
Adjust the layer of kerosene to be shallow enough to allow the top of the sodium to protrude above the surface.<br>
This reaction of sodium with the water is much slower than if the sodium had been dropped directly on to the water.<br>
You can watch the reaction through a magnifying glass held at the side, but never look down into a test-tube.<br>
Sodium metal is lighter than water, but heavier than kerosene.<br>
<b>Be careful!</b> Sodium sinks in the kerosene and floats in the water.<br>
A small area of the sodium suddenly reacts causing a stream of hydrogen bubbles to appear.<br>
The stream of bubbles at one side causes movement.<br>
The irregular shape of the sodium changes to a sphere.<br>
The sodium melts because the reaction gives off heat.<br>
Note any variations in light refraction and reflection below the sodium that suggests something dissolving in the water.<br>
Slight smoke where the hot sodium is above the kerosene level suggests a slight reaction with air.<br>
Test the gas bubbles for oxygen gas or hydrogen gas.<br>
4. <b>Be careful!</b> Use a piece of sodium the size of a wheat grain or rice grain.<br>
Do not point the open end of a test-tube containing sodium at anybody.<br>
The experiment can be done on an overhead projector.<br>
Put water into a Petri dish and add a few drops of phenolphthalein.<br>
Put the Petri dish on an overhead projector.<br>
Use forceps to take a small lump of metallic sodium stored under kerosene and wipe with a piece of filter paper.<br>
Cut a piece of sodium the size of a red bean from the lump and then put it in the Petri dish.<br>
Observe from the screen that the sodium grain floats on the water, melts into a small sphere, moving very rapidly in all directions, becoming smaller and smaller.<br>
At last, the sodium sphere wholly disappears and the solution in the dish also changes its colour from colourless to red.<br>
5. <b>Be careful!</b> Observe the reaction through the side of the test-tube.<br>
Do not look down into the test-tube!.<br>
Put a piece of sodium in 2 cm of water in a test-tube.<br>
Do not point the open end of the test-tube at anybody!.<br>
Test for hydrogen gas with a lighted splint.<br>
Test the contents with litmus paper or phenolphthalein.<br>
The reaction forms sodium hydroxide.<br>
6. <b>Be careful!</b> Observe the reaction through the side of the test-tube.<br>
Do not look down the test-tube!.<br>
Pour a 3 mm layer of kerosene (paraffin oil) on to the surface of water in a test-tube.<br>
Drop a small piece of sodium into the test-tube.<br>
The sodium sinks in the kerosene and floats in the water.<br>
The layer of kerosene should be shallow enough to let the top of the sodium protrude above the surface.<br>
The reaction of sodium with water is much slower than if the sodium had been dropped directly on to the water.<br>
A small area of the sodium suddenly reacts, which causes a stream of bubbles to appear.<br>
The irregular shape of the sodium changes to that of a sphere.<br>
The sodium melts because the reaction forms heat.<br>
Something dissolving in the water below the sodium can be seen.<br>
Some smoke where the hot sodium is above the kerosene level suggests a reaction with air.<br>
Test the gas bubbles for hydrogen gas.<br>
7. Support a short length of glass tubing vertically with one end 2 cm below the surface of water.<br>
Test the water with moist litmus paper.<br>
Add litmus paper to the water.<br>
The upper part of the tube must be quite dry.<br>
Drop a piece of sodium down the tube.<br>
Note the reaction.<br>
Test for hydrogen gas with a lighted splint.<br>
Test the water with litmus paper.<br>
The water becomes alkaline.<br>
2Na (s) + 2H2O (l) --> H2 (g) + 2NaOH (aq)<br>
8. Remove a small lump of sodium from storage under oil.<br>
Observe the layer of oxide / hydroxide on the surface of the sodium.<br>
Cut a pea-size piece from the surface of the sodium.<br>
Observe the shiny sodium metal surface that rapidly darkens because of eaction with air and moisture.<br>
9. Demonstrate the reaction of sodium with water in a fume cupboard or outside if students are protected by a safety shield, 
or wearing safety glasses.<br>
Use a large beaker filled with water to within 1 cm of the top, so that there is no space for air / hydrogen mixture to accumulate.<br>
Add a piece of sodium no greater in size than a rice grain, 3 mm diameter.<br>
Use a wire gauze on top of the beaker to prevent the ejection of sodium.<br>
The sodium fizzes around the surface of the water for a few seconds, reacting violently.<br>
Add an acid / base indicator to the water, e.g. universal indicator or phenolphthalein, to demonstrate the alkalinity of the reaction products.<br>
Demonstrate the disposal of waste sodium by reaction with ethanol or methylated spirit in a beaker in the fume cupboard as described above.<br>
The sodium and may catch fire with the following reaction:.<br>
Na + H2O--> Na+ + OH- + 1/2H2 (g)<br>
10. Place sodium on wet absorbent paper and observe the ignition of the hydrogen gas.<br>
This experiment can be used to test for the presence of alcohols.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="12.1.11H">12.1.11</a> Sodium hypochlorite, use in swimming pools<br>
Sodium hypochlorite is the liquid chlorine for use in swimming pools.<br>
 It usually provides 12% to 15% available chlorine and has a pH of 13.<br>
It is generally cheap, but difficult and dangerous to handle.<br>
It also loses its potency rapidly and is usually only used in large swimming pools.<br>
Sodium hypochlorite is stable in alkaline aqueous solutions.<br>
It is sold as 5% solution "laundry bleach", e.g. "Chlorox", and as 12-15% available chlorine<br>
 solution, often called "liquid bleach", from pool supply stores.<br>
 Sodium hypochlorite, pH of 13 is relatively low in available chlorine concentration, so more is required to maintain the disinfectant residual in swimming pools.<br>
 Because of the bulk of its liquid form and its poor storage stability, it must be purchased frequently throughout the swimming pool season.<br>
 Although it does not add hardness to the swimming pool, its high pH can contribute to scaling tendencies in hard water areas.<br>
 It is generally cheap, but difficult and dangerous to handle.<br>
 It also loses its potency rapidly and is usually only used in large swimming pools.<br>
 NaOCl + H2O --> Na+ + OCl-  + H2O<br>
 sodium hypochlorite + water --> sodium ion + hypochlorite ion + water<br>
 When dissolved, equilibrium is established between the strong oxidant HClO and the weaker ClO- ion.<br>
 HOCl + H2O --> OCl- + H3O+ (Ka = 3 × 10-8)<br>
 hypochlorous acid + water --> hypochlorite ion + hydronium ion<br>
 HOCl is much more effective in oxidizing the cell contents of bacteria, because the negative charge on OCR- may prevent passage through bacterial walls.<br>
 At about pH 6 almost all free chlorine is converted to HOCl.<br>
 At pH &lt; 2, chlorine gas forms to corrode metals and pool tile grouting.<br>
 CaSO4 (s) --> Ca2+ (aq) + SO42- (aq)<br>
 calcium sulfate (in Portland cement) --> calcium ion + sulfate ion<br>
 SO42- (aq) + H+ (aq) --> HSO4- (aq)<br>
 sulfate ion + hydrogen ion --> hydrogen sulfate ion<br>
 However, this can be minimized by adding calcium ions as calcium chloride, CaCl2, to pool water to shift the equilibrium to the left, back to solid calcium sulfate.<br>
 Both forms have a high pH, so may require frequent additions of acid to maintain swimming pool water in pH range for chlorine sanitizing, and swimmer comfort.<br>
 The hypochlorite ions also establish equilibrium with hydrogen ions, depending on the pH.<br>
 The same relative amounts of HOCl and OCl- exist at equilibrium at a given pH if either chlorine gas or hypochlorites are used.<br>
 Chlorine decreases the initial pH, and hypochlorites increase the initial pH.<br>
 Neither product provides protection against the destructive effects of sunlight on a chlorine residual, so frequent chemical additions and adjustments are necessary.<br>

 Sodium carbonate (washing soda), crystals coloured by dyes may be sold as a cheap form of bath salts.<br>
