<hr width="100%" size="2"><sup></sup><a name="15.1.1H">15.1.1 </a> Corrosion<br>
Corrosion is a general term for the environmental attack of materials including iron based materials.<br>
So the corrosion product of aluminium is not called rust, but by its chemical name.<br>
The corrosion product of iron is called rust, or iron oxides to give rust its chemical name.<br>
Corrosion refers to the unwanted oxidation of metals.<br>
Corrosion is an electrochemical reaction between a material and its environment that results in the deterioration or destruction of the material.<br>
Metallic corrosion requires at least one metal and an electrolyte, water, soil, concrete or a moist atmosphere.<br>
Metallic corrosion is the release energy stored during refining as electric current.<br>
Galvanic corrosion occurs with at least two electrically-connected metals where one metal corrodes (anode) instead of another (cathode).<br>
A simple cell consists of a zinc anode plate and a copper cathode plate immersed in an electrolyte solution.<br>
When the plates are electrically connected, the zinc plate dissolves (corrodes) to form positively charged zinc ions in the solution and electrons migrate from the anode to the copper cathode across the metallic bridge.<br>
Simultaneously, oxygen dissolved in the solution is also consumed at the cathode.<br>
Ions migrate through the solution and combine with other ions to complete the corrosion reaction.<br>
If a voltmeter were placed in the circuit between the anode and the cathode, the difference in energy levels would be measured as a DC voltage.<br>
Galvanic anodes, as distinct from impressed current anodes, do not require an external power source so are a cheap and simple method of protecting against corrosion.<br>
Galvanic electrodes are cast from high purity primary magnesium, aluminium and zinc ingot, with additional "activating" elements strictly controlled according to international standards.<br>
A metal in an electrolyte (water, sea water, soils, concrete) generates an electrical current depending on the type of electrolyte.<br>
Aluminium and zinc anode alloys are used in sea water, very conductive (low resistance) electrolyte.<br>
Magnesium alloy anodes are used in fresh water that is much less conductive (high resistivity).<br>
Any metal will usually corrode ten times faster in sea water than fresh water, because the resistivity of salt water is 0.25 ohm metres, while fresh water is typically 50 ohm metres.<br>
The aim of cathodic protection is to shift the natural voltage of a metal in a negative direction to a point at which corrosion is significantly reduced.<br>
Steel has a natural potential of -5OO mV in sea water (with respect to a standard silver / silver chloride reference electrode, e.g. "Rust Seeker".<br>
If the potential can be shifted to about -800 mV, corrosion of the steel is significantly reduced.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="15.1.2H">15.1.2</a> Galvanized iron, galvanized steel<br>
Zinc is used as a protective coating of iron for galvanized iron sheets and galvanized screws and bolts.<br>
If the coating is scratched, in the zinc iron / rain water cell the zinc corrodes to protect the iron.<br>
Also, blocks of zinc are attached to iron ships, bridges and wharfs, called sacrificial anodes.<br>
In this sacrificial corrosion, the zinc corrodes away to protect the less active iron.<br>
Nowadays, "Zincalume" steel outperforms galvanized steel.<br>
This zinc / aluminium alloy-coated steel is composed of 55% aluminium, 43.5% zinc and 1.5% silicon, which provides a superior coating for steel.<br>
The aluminium in the coating provides barrier protection to the steel and the zinc component provides sacrificial cut edge protection.<br>
This double protection mechanism is responsible for Zincalume steel's superior corrosion performance.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="15.1.3H">15.1.3</a> Tin plate<br>
Iron is coated with tin to make tin plate for tin cans, beverage cans, and jam tins.<br>
However, if the tin is scratched, the iron corrodes more rapidly than if it were not covered by tin.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="15.1.4H">15.1.4</a> Clean tarnished silver<br>
Silver is not readily oxidized, but the surface of silver can react with sulfur in the air to form black silver sulfide.<br>
For example, silver spoons used for eating eggs that contain sulfur proteins change from shiny and bright to black and matt.<br>
Polish off the silver sulfide or dissolve it using a household "silver dip" that contains ammonia or thiourea, but in each case some silver is lost.<br>
Save the silver by using the following oxidation reduction reaction that reverses the corrosion process.<br>
However, some jewellery designers deliberately create a black patina on sunken surfaces as a background contrast to bright silver surfaces.<br>
The jewellers soak the jewellery in potassium sulfide, liver of sulfur, and later buff polish the silver surfaces.<br>
Never try to clean silver with household bleach, because a hard coat of oxide forms that is very difficult to remove using the methods below.<br>
1. To clean the silver, put a sheet of aluminium in the bottom of a beaker.<br>
Put the silver to be cleaned on the aluminium and add baking soda solution (sodium hydrogen carbonate).<br>
Warm the solution.<br>
The sulfur transfers to the aluminium to form aluminium sulfide and the silver becomes shiny again.<br>
2. Clean tarnished silver with aluminium foil.<br>
Add 10 g of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3, baking soda) to hot water in a plastic container.<br>
Wrap the tarnished silver in aluminium foil and immerse it in the solution for hours until the silver sheen is restored.<br>
The sodium bicarbonate dissolves any aluminium oxide on the aluminium surface.<br>
3Ag2S (s) + 2Al (s) --> 2Al<sup>3+</sup> (aq) + 3S2<sup>-</sup> (aq) + 6Ag (s)<br>
Rub the tarnished silver with "Brasso" or toothpaste, not the gel-type toothpaste, or buff polish the surfaces.<br>
Soak the tarnished silver in dilute ammonia solution, cloudy ammonia.<br>
Soak the tarnished silver in borax and soap solution in hot water.<br>
Make pans containing hot baking soda solution to clean tarnished silverware, wrap steel wool to prevent rusting, reflect heat up through ironing board cover.<br>
3. Line a metal cake pan with aluminium foil and fill with enough water to cover the silverware.<br>
Add 30 mL baking soda per litre of water.<br>
Heat the water above 65<sup>o</sup>C, but not boiling.<br>
Place the tarnished silverware in the pan so it touches the aluminium foil.<br>
The hydrogen produced by boiling baking soda combines with the sulfur in the tarnish to removing stains.<br>
4. The bright, shiny surface of silver gradually darkens and less shiny, because silver reacts with substances containing sulfur in the air to form black silver sulfide.<br>
The tarnish on silver can be removed by polishing, but this method removes some of the silver.<br>
The method of dipping tarnished silver into a special liquid then rubbing also removes some silver.<br>
The best method is the following electrochemical reaction:<br>
Line the bottom of a pan with aluminium foil and put the tarnished silver object on the aluminium.<br>
Heat water to boiling and add 125 mL of baking soda in 2 L of water.<br>
Leave the mixture to froth then put it into the pan to cover the tarnished silver.<br>
The tarnished silver and aluminium must remain in contact during the reaction.<br>
If the tarnish does not disappear immediately, reheat the baking soda and water mixture and repeat the treatment.<br>
Aluminium has greater affinity for sulfur than silver, so sulfur atoms are transferred from silver to aluminium, to free the silver metal and form aluminium sulfide.<br>
3Ag2S + 2Al --> 6Ag + Al2S3<br>
silver sulfide + aluminium --> silver + aluminium sulfide<br>
The aluminium sulfide formed may stick to the aluminium foil or form pale yellow flakes in the bottom of the pan.<br>
 

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="15.1.5H">15.1.5</a> Corrosion of alloys, restore bronze coins<br>
Brown "copper coins" are usually alloys of zinc and tin in copper.<br>
"Silver" coins are alloys of nickel in copper.<br>
Some "gold" coins are alloys of aluminium and nickel in copper.<br>
Corrosion is common in alloys if the metals are not evenly mixed.<br>
Old coins and statues made of copper alloys and other copper materials exposed to moist air are often covered with blue-green verdigris that is basic copper (II) carbonate, CuCO3.Cu(OH)2.H2O.<br>
New "copper" coins are shiny, but they soon lose their shine and become a dark copper colour, because of a layer of black copper (II) oxide.<br>
Old copper coins may be very black between the raised areas for the numbers.<br>
Experiments<br>
1. Put drops of vinegar on a copper coin.<br>
Leave the coin until the liquid is evaporated.<br>
Green blue crystals are left on the coin surface.<br>
Scrape off the crystals and wash the coin.<br>
The coin now looks shiny, because black copper (II) oxide is removed.<br>
Use dilute hydrochloric acid to make "new" shiny coins.<br>
2. Dissolve 5 g table salt in 50 mL of vinegar in a plastic beaker.<br>
Suspend half a dull "copper" coin in the solution.<br>
The dipped half become shiny, because the coating of copper oxide has been removed.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="15.1.6H">15.1.6</a> Corrosion of aluminium<br>
Put a piece of aluminium foil in water.<br>
Put a copper coin on the foil and leave it for some days.<br>
A simple aluminium /copper cell forms and a small electric current can be detected with an ammeter.<br>
The aluminium foil has holes where the coin lies on it.<br>
The water appears cloudy, because of the fine particles of aluminium released during corrosion.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="15.1.7H">15.1.7</a> Galvanic Series<br>
The rate of corrosion is affected by formation of electric cells.<br>
All metals have an energy level that can be measured as its natural voltage within a particular electrolyte, e.g. sea water.<br>
The galvanic series table in sea water from anodic actively corrode to cathodic noble passive (more resistant to corrosion) is as follows:<br>
Mg anode alloys, Al anode alloys, Zn anode alloys, Al alloys, Cast iron, C steel (mild steel), Cu alloys (brass / bronze), Cupronickels, Cu, Ni, stainless steel (active), Ag, Ti, stainless steel (passive), Pt, Au, C (graphite).<br>
Metals at the top of the galvanic series have a large voltage difference when connected to metals at the bottom so the rate of corrosion and loss of magnesium, aluminium and zinc on comparative surface areas would be rapid.<br>
Experiment<br>
Thoroughly clean short narrow strips of the metals copper, magnesium, tin, zinc, and five pieces of pure iron wire.<br>
Twist a piece of iron wire tightly around each of the other metals.<br>
Into five clean beakers place about equal volumes of tap water.<br>
Place the single piece of iron wire in the water in one beaker and place one of the twisted pairs of metal strips in each of the other beakers.<br>
Record your observations after one hour, one day, one week.<br>
1. Cu + Fe, 2. Mg + Fe, 3. Sn + Fe, 4. Zn + Fe, 5. Fe.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="15.1.8H">15.1.8</a> Oxidation can affect air pressure<br>
Wash a small piece of steel wool in methylated spirit to remove any grease.<br>
When it is dry, put it in a test-tube with a one-hole stopper fitted with a 40 cm length of glass tubing.<br>
Clamp the test-tube with the end of the glass tubing under water.<br>
Note the level of the water in the tubing at the start of the experiment and after one hour and two hours.<br>
Water rises up the tubing as oxygen is used to form rust.<br>


<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="15.2.1H">15.2.1</a> Electrolytes</a> <br>
Electrolytes may be acids, bases or salts dissolved in water.<br>
Electrolytes are liquids containing ions that may be decomposed by electrolysis, e.g. the solution in a car battery.<br>
An electrolyte is a solution contains ions that are electrically conductive through the movement of those ions, but not electrically conductive by moving  electrons.<br>
Electrolytes form ions when dissolves in water.<br>
Living cells, blood and other tissues contain electrolytes.<br>
O.R.S. (oral rehydration salts), taken to treat diarrhoea and traveller's gastro-enteritis in children and adults, contains  balanced mix of glucose and electrolytes.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="15.2.2H">15.2.2</a> Electrolytic cells<br>
Electrolytic cells use electrons from an external source.<br>
The anode is the positive terminal of an electrolytic cell through which electrons leave and conventional current enters.<br>
The cathode is the negative electrode of an electrolytic cell through which electrons enter and conventional current leaves.<br>
If reverse voltage is applied to a Daniell cell, electrons enter the zinc cathode and zinc is deposited on it from solution.<br>
Also, electrons leave the copper anode and copper goes into solution.<br>
Zn<sup>2+</sup> (aq) + 2e<sup>-</sup> --> Zn (s)<br>
Cu (s) --> Cu<sup>2+</sup> (aq) + 2e<sup>-</sup><br>
Cu (s) + Zn<sup>2+</sup> (aq) --> Zn (s) + Cu<sup>2+</sup> (aq)<br>
The electrolytic cell is used to break up chemical compounds by electrolysis, e.g. the decomposition of water, using a Hofmann voltameter.<br>
(August Wilheim von Hofmann, 1818-1892, Germany)<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="15.2.3H">15.2.3</a> Conductivity of solutions of different electrolytes<br>
An electrolyte can conduct an electric current in the fused state, or in solution, and it is decomposed while conducting the current.<br>
Electrolytes dissolve in water to produce solutions that conduct electric current.<br>
As the concentration of the electrolyte in solution increases, the conductivity of the solution increases.<br>
A strong electrolyte breaks up almost entirely when it dissolves to produce an aqueous solution.<br>
Water is a very weak electrolyte and a poor conductor of electricity so some electrolyte must be dissolved in it to increase its conductivity.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="15.2.4H">15.2.4</a> Electrolytes in the blood and urine<br>
In medical use electrolyte refers to the ions.<br>
So serum electrolyte refers to sodium, potassium or chloride ions that function in cardiac rhythm, skeletal muscle contraction and nerve transmission.<br>
The level of bicarbonate ion is important for the acid-base balance in the blood.<br>
The urine electrolytes, sodium and potassium, indicate electrolyte balance and how hormones affect the function of the kidney.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="15.2.5H">15.2.5</a> Strong electrolytes<br>
Strong electrolytes completely ionize (dissociate), in solution.<br>
1. Add drops of sodium hydroxide solution to each of three separate solutions of copper (II) sulfate, copper (II) chloride, copper (II) nitrate.<br>
Observe the blue precipitate in each case.<br>
These solutions contain only the copper (II) ion in common, so assume that this ion was responsible for the formation of the precipitate.<br>
2. Add drops of barium chloride solution to separate solutions of copper (II) sulfate, sulfuric acid and sodium sulfate<br>
In each case you can attribute the result the presence of the sulfate ion.<br>
3. Add drops of ferric chloride solution to separate solutions of sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide.<br>
These experiments with solutions of strong electrolytes suggest that the properties of such solutions are the sum of the properties of the ions present.<br>
The properties of copper (II) sulfate solution are made up of the properties of the copper (II) ion and the sulfate ion.<br>
The copper (II) ion, Cu<sup>2+</sup>, causes the blue-green colour of the solution, and forms precipitates when other substances are added.<br>
The sulfate ion contributes no colour, but forms precipitates with many other ions, such as Ba<sup>2+</sup>, when these are added to copper (II) sulfate solution.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="15.2.6H">15.2.6</a> Weak electrolytes, ammonia solution<br>
Weak electroytes do not completely ionize, dissociate, in solution.<br>
Smell very carefully a bottle containing some dilute ammonia solution.<br>
The smell of ammonia suggests the presence of ammonia molecules that must have come from the solution.<br>
Add a few drops of iron (III) chloride to a little ammonia solution.<br>
From the results of a previous experiment with iron (III) chloride, the brown precipitate obtained confirms the presence of the hydroxide ion in ammonia solution.<br>
Thus ammonia solution has properties due not only to the ions that are present, but also, because of ammonia molecules.<br>
The properties of solutions of weak electrolytes are made up from the properties of the unionized molecules and the properties of the ions produced from them.<br>
In such solutions, the ions and molecules are in equilibrium with each other.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="15.2.11H">15.2.11</a> Tests for alcohol, breath tests<br>
1. Breath test for alcohol using potassium dichromate<br>
The breath after drinking alcoholic beverages contains ethanol vapour, which can be oxidized by orange potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7), that is reduced to green chromium (III) ions (Cr<sup>3+</sup>).<br>
Add 1 mL of 0.05% potassium dichromate solution and one drop of concentrated sulfuric acid to a small test-tube.<br>
Pour 10 mL pure ethanol (absolute alcohol) into a small distilling flask and heat the flask slowly.<br>
Pass the ethanol vapour through the potassium dichromate solution.<br>
The colour of the solution changes from orange to green.<br>
Cr2O7<sup>2-</sup> (aq) + 8H<sup>+</sup> (aq) + 3C2H5OH (l) --> 2Cr<sup>3+</sup> (aq) + 3CH3CHO (l) + H2O (l)<br>
K2Cr2O7 + 4H2SO4 + 3C2H5OH --> K2SO4 + Cr2(SO4)3 + 3CH3CHO + H2O<br>
K2Cr2O7 + 4H2SO4 + 7CH3CHO --> K2SO4 + Cr2(SO4)3 + 7CH3COOH.<br>
1. Breath test for alcohol using breath analyser ("breathalyser")<br>
Test a breath analyser used by police or hospital staff.<br>
In some countries, the breath testing apparatus used by police to detect motorists who have consumed too much alcohol is called a "breathalyser".<br>
Borrow a breath testing apparatus from the police.<br>
Ethanol vapour in the breath reduces orange potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7) to green chromium ions (Cr<sup>3+</sup>).<br>
The legal limit in some countries is 80 mg of ethanol per 100 mL of blood.<br>



 <hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="15.3.1H">15.3.1</a> Oxidants (oxidizing agents)<br>
Oxidation is loss of electrons.<br>
An oxidant causes the oxidation of another substance as it is reduced.<br>
A "good" oxidant is easily reduced.<br>
An oxidizing agent helps the oxidation of another chemical.<br>
An oxidizing agent is a substance that causes oxidation.<br>
An oxidizing agent is easily reduced, i.e. it gains electrons easily.<br>
The oxidizing agent gains the electrons and the substance being oxidized loses electrons.<br>
During oxidation, the oxidizing agent is reduced.<br>
When ferric chloride solution is added to stannous chloride solution, ferric chloride is reduced and stannous chloride is oxidized.<br>
Sn<sup>2+</sup> + 2Fe<sup>3+</sup> --> Sn<sup>4+</sup> + 2Fe<sup>2+</sup><br>
Sn<sup>2+</sup> - 2e<sup>-</sup> --> Sn<sup>4+</sup> (oxidation)<br>
2Fe<sup>3+</sup> + 2e<sup>-</sup> --> 2Fe<sup>3+</sup> (reduction)<br>
Oxidants may react violently, with reductants and with common organic materials, e.g. paper, cotton.<br>
Mix oxidants with reductants under carefully controlled conditions.<br>
Store oxidants separately from reductants.<br>
Do not heat or grind in a mortar heat-sensitive and friction-sensitive oxidants, e.g. nitrates and peroxides.<br>
Perchloric acid, potassium and potassium chlorate can explode when mixed with organic material.<br>
Permanganates, nitrates, iodates, and periodates can form explosive mixtures with combustible materials, e.g. alcohols, aluminium dust, zinc dust and sulfur.<br>
Nitric acid forms explosive mixtures with many organic compounds.<br>
Do not mix nitric acid with ethanol, alcohols of low molecular weight, and oxygenated compounds, e.g. ketones and aldehydes.<br>
Many oxidants are toxic heavy metal compounds, e.g. lead oxide and potassium dichromate.<br>
  
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="15.3.2H">15.3.2</a> Redox reactions, oxidation number<br>
Oxidation and reduction reactions (redox reactions) must occur together.<br>
In a redox reaction, the same number of electrons is gained in the reduction as is lost in the oxidation.<br>
In the following reaction, O2 is an oxidizing agent and the H2 is a reducing agent:<br>
2H2 (g) + O2 (g) --> 2H2O (l)<br>
Oxidation number, oxidation state, is the "apparent charge" on an atom, molecule or ion.<br>
The oxidation number of an element is zero, of hydrogen is +1, of H2 is zero, of hydride (e.g. NaH) is -1, of oxygen is -2, of O2 is zero, and in H2O2 is -1.<br>
Oxidation number increases when something is oxidized and decreases when something is reduced.<br>
The sum of the oxidation numbers of atoms in a molecule or ion is equal to the total charge on the molecule or ion.<br>
In the following equation:<br>
2NH3 + 3CuO --> 3Cu + 3H2O + N2<br>
2NH3 --> N2, so oxidation number increases by 6.<br>
3CuO --> 3Cu, so oxidation number decreases by 6.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="15.3.3H">15.3.3</a> Reductants (reducing agents)<br>
Reduction is gain of electrons.<br>

A "good" reductant is easily oxidized.<br>
A reducing agent helps the reduction of another chemical.<br>
A reducing agent is easily oxidized, i.e. it loses electrons easily.<br>
Examples of reducing agents include the following: Zn metal that is easily oxidized to zinc ion, Zn<sup>2+</sup>.<br>
Hydrogen sulfide that reacts with chlorine to form sulfur.<br>
Carbon reduces lead (II) oxide to lead.<br>
Carbon monoxide reduces Fe (III) oxide to iron in a blast furnace.<br>
Reductants react, often violently, with oxidants and should only be used under carefully controlled conditions.<br>
They should always be- stored dry and separated from oxidants.<br>
Alkali metals (sodium and potassium) and their amalgams react violently with water, often with the evolution and ignition of hydrogen.<br>
Metal hydrides are also very reactive with moisture and can ignite or explode on contact with water.<br>
Contact with skin or eyes is therefore very dangerous and must be avoided.<br>
Metal powders are extremely reactive with oxidizing agents, are toxic if inhaled and may cause skin sensitization.<br>

A metal tested, B copper sulfate in filter paper, C copper foil.<br>
1. Electrode potentials of metals are calculated from comparisons with the hydrogen cell under standardized conditions.<br>
However, you can use a copper and copper (II) sulfate solution as a standard.<br>
Lay filter paper soaked with copper (II) sulfate solution on clean copper foil.<br>
Use a short length of wire and crocodile clips to connect the copper foil to the positive terminal of the 1 to 5 V voltmeter.<br>
Similarly connect the specimen metal to the negative terminal of the voltmeter.<br>
Clean the surface of the specimen metal and press it firmly on absorbent paper.<br>
Record the voltage for this metal.<br>
2. Test the following metals: magnesium, tin, lead, iron, zinc aluminium, and silver.<br>
After testing a metal, clean the copper again with a fine emery cloth and replace the absorbent paper, then test another metal.<br>
The metal surfaces must be clean and the absorbent paper must contain enough copper (II) sulfate solution for a steady reading on the voltmeter.<br>
If the voltage starts at a high value and then falls as a deposit forms on the metal, record the highest value.<br>
3. Test aluminium after dipping it in concentrated hydrochloric acid then press it on absorbent paper to remove the layer of aluminium oxide.<br>
The voltage reading will start at a low value then increase as remaining aluminium oxide dissolves.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="15.5.5H">15.5.5</a> Need for oxygen for rusting<br>
1. Compare the heights of water in the two measuring cylinders in the previous experiment.<br>
The water level is higher in the cylinder containing the rusted steel wool.<br>
The height of water rises until the original volume of air in the cylinder decrease by one fifth.<br>
This proportion represents how much oxygen is in the air.<br>
The lost oxygen is combined with the iron of the steel wool to form rust.<br>
2. Moisten inside a test-tube with water.<br>
Put iron filings in the bottom of the test-tube and insert a piece of cotton wool to keep them in place.<br>
Invert the test-tube in a beaker one third full of water.<br>
The water levels inside and outside the test-tube should be the same.<br>
Mark the original water level on the outside surface of the test-tube.<br>
After two days, the iron rusts and the water level rise inside the tube until it is steady.<br>
About one fifth of the original air in the test-tube is used up.<br>
This suggests that when iron filings rust, oxygen is used.<br>
3. Repeat the experiment with magnesium ribbon replacing iron wire.<br>
The water height inside the graduated cylinder will go down to give an increase in the air volume.<br>
This result comes from the hydrogen gas formed in the reaction of magnesium with water.<br>

 Mark the levels on the test-tube with a grease pencil and leave for a few days.<br>
 The iron will rust and the water level will rise inside the test-tube,  finally becoming steady.<br>
 Add water to the container until the levels inside and outside the test-tube are the same and mark the new level.<br>
 About one fifth of the air volume has been used up, suggesting that oxygen has been used up in the rusting of iron.<br>

<a href="../images/3.3.1ch.gif">See diagram 3.3.1</a>: Rusting iron wire<br>
Rusting is the corrosion of iron and iron-based alloys, eg. steel.<br>
The corrosion product of iron is termed rust, or iron oxides to give rust its chemical name.<br>
Rusting of iron is a multi-step process where metallic iron changes to Fe(OH)3.xH2O.<br>
Rusting needs air and water and increases if the water contains salts.<br>
Prevent rusting by painting outside surfaces or by oiling machinery surfaces or by absorbing moisture with silica gel to protect delicate machinery, e.g. cameras.<br>
Experiments<br>
1. When iron rusts, it changes from Fe to Fe2O3.xH2O.<br>
Weigh some dry iron filings.<br>
Leave in moist air for two days.<br>
Note any increase in weight as rust forms.<br>
2. Fill a 30 mL wide necked bottle with a big ball of polished thin iron wire (about 0.6 g).<br>
Add water to soak the iron wire and then pour the water out.<br>
Close the mouth of the bottle with a rubber stopper fitted with a 40 cm straight glass tube.<br>
Invert the bottle and clamp it on an iron stand with the end of the glass tube under the water in a beaker.<br>
Mark the original water level on the outside of the glass tube.<br>
Note the water height every hour.<br>
The water level rises slowly in the first five hours and then goes up at a faster speed of about 0.5-0.6 cm an hour.<br>
After one day, rising of the water level slows again.<br>
3. Polish 0.4 g (about 130 cm long) of thin iron wire (or thin wire gauze) and curl it into a small ball.<br>
Push the ball into the bottom of a 10 mL graduated cylinder.<br>
Add water to immerse the iron wire and cover the mouth of the cylinder with a slice of glass.<br>
Holding the glass slice, invert the cylinder and adjust the water height to a certain mark (say, "9.0 mL") by carefully moving the glass slice.<br>
 Stand the inverted graduated cylinder over a dish containing water and remove the glass slice.<br>
 After two days, much reddish brown rust forms on the surface of the iron wire and the water level rises to show a one fifth decrease, (about 1.8 mL if the original water level is adjusted to "9.0") in the air volume inside the cylinder.<br>
4. Mass of iron and its temperature increases during rusting<br>
<a href="../images/3.2.41ch.gif">See diagram 3.2.41</a>: Counterbalanced iron<br>
Balance a piece of iron or steel wool on a knife edge with a brass weight.<br>
Leave in moist air for a few days and note the effect of rusting on the weight of the iron.<br>
During rusting, iron changes to iron (III) oxide hydrate, hydrated ferric oxide.<br>
4Fe + xH2O + 3O2 --> 2Fe2O3.xH2O.<br>
5. Weigh a piece of steel wool, add water and allow it to rust.<br>
Dry it carefully and weigh the steel wool again.<br>
The rusted steel wool is heavier than the unrusted steel wool.<br>
6. Invert a measuring cylinder and place it below the surface of the water.<br>
Use a bent rubber tube to withdraw air from the cylinder until the volume of air is exactly 100 mL when the water level inside and outside the cylinder are the same.<br>
Push some steel wool up to the closed end of the cylinder.<br>
Leave the apparatus for a few days and note how much gas is left in the cylinder.<br>
Push a lighted taper into the gas and note what happens.<br>
Remove the steel wool and examine it.<br>
When iron rusts, an increase in weight occurs.<br>
The iron combines with oxygen from the air.<br>
The remaining gas extinguishes a lighted taper placed in it.<br>
7. Almost fill a thermos flask with loosely packed, damp, steel wool.<br>
Place a one-hole stopper fitted with a thermometer into the mouth of the flask.<br>
The bulb of the thermometer bulb must be touching the steel wool.<br>
Record the initial temperature of the apparatus and note the daily temperatures for five days.<br>
The rusting of steel wool is an exothermic reaction.<br>

<a href="../images/3.3.1ch.gif">See diagram 3.3.3</a>: Rusting steel wool<br>
1. Rusting forms red hydrated, Fe2O3.<br>
Wrap a thermometer bulb in wet steel wool results and note the temperature rise.<br>
Fe2O3 is a red pigment.<br>
4Fe (s) + 3 O2 (g) --> 2 Fe2O3 (s).<br>
2. Use two measuring cylinders.<br>
Push steel wool into the bottom of one measuring cylinder and leave the other as a control.<br>
Pour 50 mL water into each measuring cylinder.<br>
Hold a piece of cardboard over the mouth of each measuring cylinder and invert it over a shallow dish containing water.<br>
Remove the cardboard.<br>
Adjust the height of the water in each inverted measuring cylinder by blowing in air with a bent pipette so the height of water in two measuring cylinders is the same.<br>
Leave the experiment for several days.<br>
3. Repeat the experiment with salty water.<br>
The rusting occurs more quickly, not because the sodium chloride takes part in the reaction, but because it gives the water more conduction.<br>
Similarly, the presence of sulfur dioxide in the air in cities and industrial sites increases the rate of rusting.<br>
Fe + 1/2O2 + H2 (from water) -->Fe(OH)2 [iron (II) hydroxide]<br>
4Fe(OH)2 + O2 --> 2Fe2O3.3H2O + H2O [iron (III) oxide]<br>
The Fe(OH)2 in solution is oxidized to Fe2O3.<br>
4. Fit a small wide mouth bottle with a rubber stopper and a glass tube about 3 m long.<br>
Fit the bottle with a rubber stopper and a glass tube about 3 m long.<br>
Use a bundle of steel wool that is big enough to fill the bottle.<br>
Remove any oil from the steel wool by washing it in petrol then leaving it to dry.<br>
Put the steel wool in the bottle and insert the stopper fitted with a glass tube.<br>
Invert the bottle and support it with the end of the tube under water.<br>
Record the water level in the tube each hour.<br>
5. Moisten some steel wool with iron chloride solution to accelerate rusting.<br>
Wrap the bulb of a thermometer in the steel wool.<br>
Hang in a draught free place.<br>
Note the temperature changes as rust forms.<br>
6. Roll some steel wool into a ball and weigh it.<br>
Use tongs to hold the ball of steel wool over a sheet of paper.<br>
Heat the steel wool over a burner until red-hot.<br>
Remove the burner and blow gently on the red hot steel wool until it stops burning.<br>
Weigh the burned steel wool and any fragments that have fallen on to the sheet of paper.<br>
The weight is greater, because the iron oxide that forms is heavier than the steel wool.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="15.5.9H">15.5.9</a> Rusting paper clips<br>
Observe a paper clip used to clip together an old pile of paper.<br>
Note any rust marks.<br>
Rusting starts where the paper clip is closest to the paper.<br>
This occurs because there is the least exposure to oxygen gas to allow the chromium layer to produce protective oxides.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="15.5.10H">15.5.10</a> Stainless steel<br>
Stainless steel contains 12-5% Cr to produce the stainless chromium oxide film on the surface to prevent corrosion.<br>
So stainless steel must be kept clean to maximum availability of oxygen to the chromium atoms.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="15.6.0H">15.6.0</a> Cathodic protection<br>
Electrochemical prevention of rusting<br>
Cathodic protection (CP) is a method of corrosion control that can be applied to buried and submerged metallic structures.<br>
It is normally used in conjunction with coatings and can be considered as a secondary corrosion control technique.<br>
The primary corrosion control method on any given structure is a coating, which can be between 50 and 99 % efficient, depending upon age and installation.<br>
A properly designed and maintained cathodic protection system will take up the remainder resulting in a 100 % efficient corrosion protection system.<br>
Cathodic protection reduces the rate of corrosion of a metallic surface by making the metal the cathode.<br>
This can be achieved by attaching galvanic (sacrificial) anodes or impressed current anodes.<br>
A more electronegative metal, e.g. zinc, is attached as a "sacrificial anode" that goes into solution instead of the iron.<br>
Also, you can apply direct current to make the iron into a cathode.<br>
Cathodic protection can protect iron ships and bridges from corrosion.<br>
Other metals, including aluminium alloys, stainless steels, brasses and bronzes all require some level of protection against corrosion.<br>
Wooden sailing ships were protected from fouling organisms by the release of copper ions from copper sheathing of the ship's bottom.<br>
However, copper sheathing on an iron bottom ship produced an electrochemical cell in the sea water that corroded the iron.<br>
This could be prevented by attaching blocks of zinc the bottom to give cathodic protection to the copper.<br>
Experiments<br>
1. A "tin can" is made by covering sheets of iron with tin plate to exclude oxygen.<br>
If the "tin can" is scratched and it is wet, the iron corrodes very rapidly, because an electrochemical cell is set up.<br>
Wrap a piece of aluminium foil around the lower part of a nail.<br>
Put the nail and metal in a test-tube.<br>
Add tap water to cover the lower part of the nail.<br>
Use these metals: control (no metal) magnesium ribbon, zinc foil, copper wire, tin foil.<br>
Put the test-tubes in a test-tube rack put stoppers on the test-tubes and leave them undisturbed for several days.<br>
If a very small amount of sodium chloride is added to each test-tube, rusting can occur within an hour.<br>
Rusting first starts in the test-tubes containing copper or tin, then it starts in the control.<br>
Iron is more active than copper or tin, so forms the positive ion Fe<sup>2+</sup> to react with negative ions in solution to form precipitates of rust on the nail.<br>
No rusting occurs in the test-tubes containing magnesium ribbon or zinc, but they form ions that react with negative ions to form white precipitates.<br>
2. Use a magnesium pencil sharpener with the iron blade still attached by a screw.<br>
Add two drops of universal indicator to a dilute solution of sodium chloride in a beaker.<br>
The neutral solution should be green.<br>
Add the magnesium pencil sharpener.<br>
Hydrogen gas forms at the steel blade.<br>
The solution becomes a basic purple.<br>
A white precipitate of magnesium hydroxide forms.<br>
 During the next few days, the magnesium becomes corroded (sacrificed), leaving the steel blade protected from rusting.<br>
At the magnesium anode oxidation occurs.<br>
Mg --> Mg<sup>2+</sup> + 2e<sup>-</sup><br>
At the steel blade cathode reduction occurs.<br>
2H2O + 2e<sup>-</sup> --> H2 + 2OH<sup>-</sup>.<br>
