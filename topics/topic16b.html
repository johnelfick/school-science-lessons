<hr width="100%" size="2">16.0.0 Amines<br>
Amines have the functional group C2H5NH2<br>
Amines are produced by the decay of organic matter, ammonia-derivative organic compounds of nitrogen where one or more hydrogen atoms has been replaced by a hydrocarbon radical, an alkyl or aryl group.<br>
Amines are organic derivative of ammonia, NH3, where one, two or three hydrogen atoms are replaced by alkyl groups as a primary amine, secondary amine or tertiary amine, e.g. trimethylamine CH3NCH3CH3.<br>
Amines usually act as weak bases that form ammonium salts that are more soluble in water than the original amine, e.g. cough medicine, may contain the cough suppressants dextramethorphan hydrobromide or the decongestant, expectorant, pseudoephidrine hydrochloride and ephedrine.<br>
<a name="16.0.1H">
Amines, RNH2 (amino, -NH2), amine, e.g. methylamine, CH3NH2<br>
Amines, aliphatic amines (RNH2-, R = alkyl group).<br>
Primary amine, methylamine, CH3N2.<br>
Secondary amine, dimethylamine, (CH3)2NH.<br>
Tertiary amine, trimethylamine, N(CH3)3.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2">16.0.1 Tests for trimethylamine, fish smell<br>
 Proteins in raw fish are denatured by citric acid, lemon juice.<br>
 Freshly caught fish have no odour.<br>
 However, the end products of enzyme reactions accumulate when the fish is to give the characteristic fish smell.<br>
 If fish is not fresh, it give off trimethylamine, N(CH3)3, the source of fish smell.<br>
 The cooked fish is less tasty and the cooking smell is offensive.<br>
<a name="TrimethylamineH">Trimethylamine</a><br>
 Trimethylamine, CH3NCH3CH3, (TMA), volatile tertiary aliphatic amine, from food containing it or from precursors, e.g. (TMNO)<br>
<a href="appendixA.html#TrimethylamineH">Trimethylamine</a>, C3H9N<br>
 trimethylthamine-N-oxide, and L-Carnitine, C7H15NO3, an amino acid derivative.<br>
 In humans, ingested TMA may convert to TMNO by N-oxidation, but this process and its importance is not well understood, in 4-11-2016.<br>
 TMA is produced by bacteria in the human intestines, but it is broken down by oxidation in the liver.<br>
 The reaction requires a certain enzyme, but if people do not have the enzyme, due to a genetic fault, they may smell "fishy"!<br>
 They suffer from a metabolic disorder called Trimethylaminuria (TMAU).<br>
 They can be relieved of this embarrassing problem by avoiding foods rich in the amino alcohol choline.<br>
 Trimethylamine is found in beetroot and herrings, so some people say that beetroot has a "herring smell".<br>
Experiment<br>
 Stopping fish smell when cooking fish<br>
 To stop fish smell, soak fish in soy bean paste or milk so that proteins in them absorb the smell.<br>
 Use ginger or green onion during cooking.<br>
 Lemon juice, vinegar, wine, and rice wine can neutralize fish fat, which contains trimethylamine.<br>
 Soak freshwater fish in vinegar water before cooking.<br>
 At the end of rigour mortis, bacterial action may decompose the fish protein and add to the offensive smell.<br>
 Fish should be eaten fresh and cooked for only a short time to denature tissue between the fibres and heat the fish to an acceptable temperature for eating.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2">16.1.0 Amino acids<br>
 1. Amino acids have two functional groups, a carboxylic acid group, (-COOH), and a primary amine, (-NH2).<br>
 α-amino acids have the formula NH2CRHCOOH<br>
 NH2CRHCOOH + NH2CRHCOOH --> NH2CRHCONHCRHCOOH + H2O<br>
 amino acid + amino acid--> dipeptide + water<br>
 Amino acids are water-soluble organic compounds and are the primary products of nitrogen anabolism in plants.<br>
 Amino acids use peptide bonds to join and form short chain peptides and long chain polypeptides, e.g. proteins.<br>
 Only 20 of the hundreds of plant amino acids are known.<br>
The primary protein amino acids, are used by all organisms in the formation of peptides and proteins.<br>
 However, animals cannot synthesize all the 20 amino acids.<br>
 2. Amino acids<br>
 From "Peptide Guide", by Oleg Larin (D. Mendeleev University of Chemical Technology of Russia).<br>
 Most amino acids have the structure R-CH(NH2)COOH, with R = hydrogen or an organic group, aliphatic, aromatic or heterocyclic.<br>
 The α-amino acids in peptides and proteins (except proline), have:<br>
 * a carboxylic acid group -COOH, and an amino group -NH2, H3N+-), with these groups attached to the same carbon atom, the α-carbon atom,<br>
 * and an R-group (an organic group or H), that distinguishes one amino acid from another.<br>
 Amino acids have two functional groups, 1. a carboxylic acid and 2. a primary amine.<br>
 In strong acids, the H2N group accepts a proton to form a positive ion.<br>
 In strong alkalis, the -O-H group loses a proton to form a negative ion.<br>
 The carboxylic acid group tends to lose a proton to act as an acid.<br>
 -C=O(OH) &lt;=&gt; -C=O-O- + H+<br>
 The amine group tends to accept a proton to act as a base.<br>
 H-NH- + H+ &lt;=&gt; H-N+-H2-<br>
 So amino acids act as zwitterions, i.e. have both a positive and negative charge, but an overall neutral charge<br>
 HN+H2RCHC=OO-.<br>
 3. The 7 types of amino acids<br>
<a href="../images/16.3.6.0.1ch.gif">See diagram 16.3.6.0.1</a> Amino acids, Types 1 to 4<br>
Type 1. Amino acids with aliphatic R-groups, e.g. alanine, glycine, isoleucine, leucine, valine<br>
Type 2. Non-aromatic amino acids with hydroxyl R-groups, e.g. serine, threonine<br>
Type 3. Amino acids with sulfur-containing R-groups, e.g. cysteine, methionine<br>
Type 4. Acidic amino acids and their amides, e.g. aspartic acid, 2-aminopentanedioic acid, asparagine, glutamic acid, glutamine.<br>
 <a href="../images/16.3.6.0.2ch.gif">See diagram 16.3.6.0.2</a> Amino acids, Types 5, 6 and 7, Imino acid proline<br>
Type 5. Basic amino acids arginine, lysine, histidine<br>
Type 6. Amino acids with aromatic rings phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan.<br>
Type 7. Imino acids proline, C5H9NO2.<br>
4. <a name="16.3.6.1.1H">Amino acid nomenclature</a><br>
 1. The table below contains the trivial name of the L or D or DL-amino acid, e.g. Alanine, the IUPAC 3-letter code, e.g. Ala, the systematic name, e.g. 2-Aminopropanoic acid, and the formula, e.g. CH3-CH(NH2)-COOH.<br>
 The ten essential amino acids, marked with *, must be in the diet, because they cannot be synthesized.<br>
 Also, plant proteins may not contain sufficient lysine and tryptophan in the diets of strict vegetarians.<br>
 Carboxylic acids (fatty acids), R-(COOH)n, contain the group -CO.OH, i.e. -COOH, carbonyl group attached to a hydroxyl group, are weak acids.<br>
 An anion formed from carboxylic acid is called a carboxylate.<br>
 Methanoic acid (formic acid), HCOOH<br>
 Ethanoic acid (acetic acid), CH3COOH<br>
 Propanoic acid (propionic acid), CH3CH2COOH<br>
 Butanoic acid (butyric acid), C3H7COOH<br>
 Pentanoic acid (valeric acid), CH3(CH2)COOH<br>
 Butanedioic acid (succinic acid) CH2)2(COOH)2<br>
 The symbol Asx denotes Asp or Asn.<br>
5. Numbering of carbon atoms in amino acids<br>
In acyclic amino acids, the carbon atom of the carboxyl group next to the carbon atom carrying the amino group is numbered 1.<br>
The carbon atoms in proline are numbered as in pyrrolidine, the nitrogen atom being numbered 1, and proceeding towards the carboxyl group.<br>
The carbon atoms in the aromatic rings of phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan are numbered as in systematic nomenclature, with 1, (or 3 for tryptophan), designating the carbon atom bearing the aliphatic chain.<br>
6. <a name="16.3.6.1.2H">The 20 important naturally-occurring amino acids</a><br>

<hr width="100%" size="2">16.2.1 Glycaemic index (GI)<br>
 The glycaemic index is a ranking of carbohydrates based on their immediate effect on blood glucose (blood sugar), levels.<br>
 It compares foods gram for gram of carbohydrate.<br>
 Carbohydrates that breakdown quickly during digestion have the highest glycaemic indexes.<br>
 The blood glucose response is fast and high.<br>
 Carbohydrates that breakdown slowly, releasing glucose gradually into the blood stream, have low glycaemic indexes.<br>
 The theory behind low-glycaemic index diets is that rapidly digested, high-glycaemic index carbohydrates cause fluctuations in blood glucose (sugar) and insulin levels, contributing to hunger and preventing the breakdown of fat.<br>
 Glycaemia refers to the rise in blood sugar.<br>
 GI is a ranking of carbohydrates in food depending on their immediate effects on blood sugar levels.<br>
 Carbohydrates that breakdown rapidly during digestion and release glucose quickly into the blood have a high GI.<br>
 Carbohydrates with a low GI are called "smart carbs".<br>
 Low GI diets help people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, pregnancy diabetes, overweight, excess abdominal fat, too high blood glucose levels, high levels of triglycerides and low levels of HDL cholesterol, ("good cholesterol").<br>
 GI values: High GI = 70+, Medium GI = 59-69, Low GI = &lt;55.<br>
 Glycaemic load of a serving = (carbohydrate content in grams (g), X GI of the food) / 100,<br>
 So 1 glycaemic load unit has the effect of consuming one gram of glucose.<br>

Experiment<br>
 Heat a mixture of starch and water by pouring boiling water on it while stirring.<br>
 The colour turns from chalk white to nearly water white, because the starch grains have burst and let the starch out.<br>
 This is similar to making the starch more soluble and more digestible.<br>

Glycoprotein, Mucous glycoprotein, C28H47N5O18, conjugated protein-carbohydrate compounds, e.g. mucins, mucoid, and amyloid glycoproteins.
If the sugars are bound to proteins they are called glycoprotein or if bound to fats they are called glycolipids.<br>
Glycoproteins are the proteins covalently attached to carbohydrates, e.g. glucose, galactose, lactose.<br>
Glycolipids are carbohydrate-attached lipids.<br>
Their role is to provide energy and also serve as markers for cellular recognition.<br>
Collectively they are called glycoconjugates of which 11 % of the human body is composed.<br>
Glycoproteins are the most common conjugated proteins.<br>
Glycoproteins are proteins with covalently attached sugar units, i.e. complex polypeptides + polysaccharides chains.<br>
They are protective agents and lubricants and are often found in cell walls.<br>
<a name="16.2.3H">
There are two main types:<br>
1. O-linked glycans have N-acetylgalactosamine attached to the O-terminus of a threonine or serine residue.<br>
2. N-linked glycans have N-acetylglucosamine bonded to the amide nitrogen of an asparagine molecule.<br>
N-acetylglucosamine is a glucose molecule bonded to an amine group bonded to a hydroxyl group.<br>
Glycoproteins on erythrocytes control interaction of blood group substances with antibodies.<br>
They are involved in cell recognition in T-cells, HIV Aids, blood cell antigens, antibodies and pollen recognition.<br>
Laminins are cross-shaped glycoproteins in extracellular matrix of animals and plants.<br>

 Lactic acid, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, C3H6O3<br>
 It occurs as an hygroscopic clear liquid or crystals.<br>
 It forms in cells at end stage of glucose metabolism in absence of oxygen.<br>
 It accumulates after strenuous exercise to cause cramp, "stitch", in the diaphragm solar plexus.<br>
 It is manufactured by bacterial fermentation of sugars, or by heating glucose with certain concentrations of caustic potash solution.<br>
 Lactic acid bacteria convert sugars into lactic acid, so are used in pickling, but also it can cause food spoilage, e.g. souring of milk by (Lactobacillus acidophilus).<br>
(Streptococcus mutans) causes tooth decay and it needs both glucose and fructose from the breakdown of sucrose in food and soft drinks to produce plaque and lactic acid.<br>
(Lactobacillus) (over 120 species) converts lactose to lactic acid, in decaying plant substances, is benign in vagina and intestines.<br>
It is used as a leavening agent to make fermentation products.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2">16.2.6 Lectins<br>
1. Lectins are a kind of defensive plant protein in seeds which protect them against common pests, sometimes described as "built-in insecticides".<br>
Lectins are sugar binding proteins, obtained mainly from the seeds of legumes, which bind specifically to certain sugars or saccharide residues causing agglutination of particular cells.<br>
Seed lectins are toxic to humans only when the seed is eaten raw, but may be denatured by cooking for about 20 minutes.<br>
Lectins occur in most types of beans, e.g soybeans, grains, dairy products, potato, tomato, eggplant and pepper<br>
Dairy lectins have been implicated in juvenile onset type I diabetes.<br>
Wheat lectins have been implicated in juvenile nephropathy.<br>
Lectins from soy, peanut, wheat germ, milk, nightshades, have caused damage to gut lining, joints, kidney, pancreas and brain.<br>
Lectins found in peanut oil have been implicated in atherosclerosis.<br>
The reaction between the agglutinin and the cell membrane causes alteration of the cell function thus producing the toxic effect.<br>
Lectins in plants bind glycoproteins on the surface of cells<br>
Lectins in animals also bind of soluble extracellular and intercellular glycoproteins.<br>
Lectins in the immune system may recognize carbohydrates found exclusively on pathogens.<br>
Lectins are used in resaerch to to clump red blood cells according to blood group and to stimulate mitosis.<br>
Lectins include the following:<br>

It is now sold by chemical suppliers.<br>
4. <a name="HemagglutininsH"></a>Hemagglutinins<br>
 Hemagglutinins (haemagglutinins), cause agglutination of red blood cells.<br>
 Lectin hemagglutinins, phytohemagglutinins (PHA), occur in many types of bean, but the highest concentration is in red kidney beans, <a href="../biology/UNBiolN3P.html#PhaseolusspH">Phaseolus vulgaris</a>, which may cause intestinal problems, diarrhoea and vomiting.<br>
The disorder is unpleasant, but not toxic.<br>
These beans must be first soaked and cooked in boiling water for at least 10 minutes.<br>
Cooking in less than boiling water may increase the toxicity of the beans!<br>
5. <a name="RicinH"></a> Ricin<br>
Ricin is a poisonous glycoprotein in the seeds of Ricinus communis (Castor bean).<br>
It is one of the most toxic substances known, and there is no antidote for ricin.<br>
However, ricin is water-soluble, so it should not be present in castor oil expressed from the castor bean.<br>
If castor bean seed seeds are chewed or swallowed, ricin may prevent protein synthesis, although some ricin is inactivated in the stomach.<br>
Castor bean seed contains type 2 types of disulfide-linked chains of ribose-inactivating protein, RIP.<br>
Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA)
It occurs in two forms designated RCA60 and RCA120 according to their mol. wt. of approx. 60, 000 and 120, 000 respectively:<br>
* RCA120, also referred to as RCAI is an agglutinin and has an affinity for terminal beta-D-galactosyl residues.<br>
Ricin toxic A chain, N-glycoside hydrolase, Ricinus communis agglutinin, RCAI, contain amino acids causes red blood cells to agglutinate and burst by haemolysis.<br>
* RCA60, also referred to as RCAII or Ricin D is extremely toxic, inhibits protein synthesis and has an affinity for N-acetyl-D-galactosamine.<br>
Ricin toxic B chain, lectin, many amino acids, RCAII, Ricinus communis agglutinin II is an extremely toxic glycoprotein consisting of two disulfide-linked chains.<br>
The B chain can bind to cell surfaces via galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine residues of membrane glycoconjugates and facilitates the transport of lectin to the cell.<br
The A chain has an enzyme activity, which can catalytically block protein synthesis and is so toxic that only a single molecule of A chain is required to kill a cell.<br>
The A chain is incapable of entering the cell and is thus not toxic.<br>
Ricin could be used in chemical warfare and in 1978, Bulgarian Georgi Markov died when injected with ricin from a poisoned umbrella tip.<br>
Ricin may cause death of certain cancer cells, because RCAI-specific cell surface glycoproteins may cause metastasis in breast cancers.<br>
The ricin toxins are mostly stable to proteolytic enzymes and so are not destroyed when taken orally.

It has not set well, because the fresh pineapple contains enzymes that digest protein in the jelly.<br>
The enzymes in the tinned pineapple have become inactive, because of heating and processing.<br>
 Fresh pineapple contains a powerful proteolytic enzyme called bromelase, but in tinned pineapple it is inactivated.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2">16.6.0 Proteins<br>
 Protein is a "macronutrient, ", i.e. the body needs large amounts of it.<br>
 Unlike fat and carbohydrates, the body does not store protein, so has no reservoir to draw on when it is needed.<br>
 The basic structure of protein is a chain of amino acids.<br>
 Of the 20 amino acids the human body needs to make proteins, the body itself produces only 12 amino acids.<br>
 Proteins, peptides, and amino acids are used to make:<br>
* Structural proteins for the body and its organs and tissues<br>
* Enzymes for catalysts in biochemical reactions<br>
* Hormones, e.g. insulin to regulate the blood sugar level<br>
* Antibodies to protect from viruses and bacteria<br>
* Intermediates in complex reactions, e.g. ornithine [H2NCH2CH2CH2CH(NH2)COOH].<br>
Structural forms of proteins<br>
* Primary proteins with a straight chain of amino acids<br>
* Secondary proteins with a helical coil of amino acids stabilized by hydrogen bonds<br>
* Tertiary proteins with folding and looping of a coiled polypeptide stabilized by hydrogen bonds<br>
* Quaternary proteins with four joined tertiary proteins, e.g. haemoglobin.<br>
1. Fibrous proteins and globular proteins<br>
Fibrous proteins are usually insoluble in water and form long coiled strands, e.g. keratin, collagen, actin, myosin, fibrin.<br>
 * Collagen is an insoluble fibrous protein in connective tissue, e.g. tendons, skin, bone.<br>
 * Keratin, C47H77N13O15, contains the cysteine molecule formed by oxidation between sulfhydryl groups, -SH, 
of two cysteine molecules to form disulfide bonds, -S-S-, for strong proteins as in hair.<br>
<a href="../images/Anthraquinone2.png">See diagram</a>: Keratin.<br>
 2. Globular proteins are usually water-soluble, e.g. enzymes, antibodies, haemoglobin, casein, albumin, insulin.<br>
 3. Proteins lose their structure and coagulate when heated above 50oC, or are acted on by acids or alkalis, e.g. egg white.<br>
 Such proteins lose their biological function, i.e. become denatured.<br>
 Peptides and polypeptides are polymers of the 20 α-amino acids are listed below.<br>
 Other amino acids with special functions occur in the mammal body free or in combined states, i.e. not associated with peptides or proteins.<br>
 Some α-amino acids listed below have functions other than forming peptides and proteins, e.g. tyrosine is used to form thyroid hormones.<br>
 Proteins are amphoteric<br>
 Amino acids are amphoteric in that they contain both acidic and basic groups in their molecules.<br>
 Proteins dissolve in alkalis and in concentrated solutions of acids.<br>
 In alkaline solutions proteins are negatively charged.<br>
 In strongly acid solutions proteins are positively charged.<br>
 They are uncharged at the isoelectric point and are precipitated.<br>
 At pH higher than the isoelectric point, a protein acts as an acid.<br>
 At pH lower than the isoelectric point the protein acts as a base.<br>
When acting as an acid a protein forms a fast colour with a basic dye, e.g. methylene blue.<br>
When acting as a base, a protein reacts with an acid dye, e.g. eosin.<br>
Experiment<br>
To show the amphoteric nature of a protein, prepare four test-tubes, two containing eosin, and two containing methylene blue.<br>
1. Add a white feather or white wool to each test-tube.<br>
Add 3 drops of acetic acid to one eosin solution and 3 drops of concentrated ammonia solution (ammonium hydroxide), to the other eosin solution.<br>
 Leave to stand for five minutes.<br>

<a href="../images/16.3.6.0.3ch.gif">16.3.6.0.3</a> Peptide bond<br>
1. Peptides are formed when two amino acids are joined by a peptide bond<br>
Compounds formed by the linkage of amino acids in amide linkages are called peptides, NH2-CH-R<br>
Two amino acids can form a dipeptide, three amino acids can form a tripeptide, about 50 amino acids can form a polypeptide, and more than 50 amino acids can from a protein molecule.<br>
However, when a protein or polypeptide is boiled in 6 M hydrochloric acid for a long period, all the peptide linkages are hydrolysed and all the original amino acids can be recovered as separate molecules.<br>
<a name="16.5.2H">
2. Polypeptides are polyamides formed from the same or different amino acid monomers.<br>
A protein is a large polypeptide.<br>
The dipeptide unit still has -NH2 and -COOH groups, so it can continue to react to form polypeptides by condensation polymerization.<br>
However, polypeptides are usually composed of many different amino acids.<br>

Tests for calcium - Test 1.<br>
To 0.2 mL of a neutral solution containing a quantity of the substance to be examined equivalent to about 0.2 mg of calcium (Ca2+) per mL, add 0.5 mL of a 0.2% w / v solution of glyoxal-bis-(2-hydroxyanil) in 96% v / v ethanol.<br>
Add to this mixture 0.2 mL of a 10.6% w / v solution of anhydrous sodium carbonate.<br>
Shake this mixture with 2 mL of chloroform and add 2 mL of distilled water.<br>
Shake the mixture again to allow the denser chloroform layer to separate from the aqueous layer.<br>
A chloroform layer coloured red confirms the presence of calcium ions.<br>

Burning, leaves of the tobacco plant give off smoke in which more than one thousand chemical substances have been identified.<br>
These substances include tobacco tar, nicotine, carbon oxide and aldehydes considered harmful to human health.<br>
Tobacco tar contains many kinds of carcinogens, e.g. benzopyrene.<br>
Nicotine is similar to hydrocyanic acid in toxicity.<br>
Excessive carbon oxide will weaken oxygen-carrying capacity of blood, and lead to an oxygen deficit in body tissues.<br>
Experiment<br>
 Put 10 mL of 95% alcohol in a sidearm test-tube.<br>
 Fit a test-tube with a one hole stopper carrying a glass delivery tube.<br>
 Keep one end under the alcohol and close to the bottom of the test-tube.<br>
 Insert the other end of the delivery tube in a lighted cigarette.<br>
 Draw smoke down through the delivery tube into the alcohol solution by using an air extractor attached to the side arm of the test-tube.<br>
 Some substances, e.g. nicotine and benzidine, dissolve in the alcohol to make the colour of the solution change from colourless to yellow, and finally to brown, along with an increase in the number of lighted cigarettes.<br>

Note their odours.<br>
Drop small pieces of red and blue litmus paper into each liquid.<br>
Add to each about 5 mL of dilute hydrochloric acid.<br>
If you see no visible signs of reaction, warm each mixture gently by standing the tube in hot water for 5 minutes.<br>
Cautiously smell any gas that may be coming from the test-tubes.<br>

If you see no visible signs of reaction, warm each mixture gently by standing the tube in hot water for 5 minutes.<br>
Cautiously smell any gas that may be coming from the test-tubes.<br>
Avoid smelling for more than one second any gases liberated, since one of them can cause general anaesthesia when inhaled in sufficient quantity.<br>
There is no apparent reaction when hydrochloric acid is mixed with either of the two alcohols.<br>
But after heating the mixture with concentrated sulfuric acid, a reaction occurs, shown by the production of a gas with a sweetish "ethereal" smell.<br>

(Johan Kjeldahl, 1849-1900, Denmark)<br>
16.5.7 Tests for nitrogen content in food, Kjeldahl method<br>
 1. Be careful! Do this experiment in a fume cupboard.<br>
 Add 10 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid to 0.5 g of urea in a long necked flask (Kjeldahl Flask).<br>
 Add potassium hydrogen sulfate to raise the boiling point of the acid and complete the decomposition of the protein.<br>
 Boil in a fume cupboard for 10 minutes.<br>
 Leave to cool then add 100 mL water.<br>
 Add strong sodium hydroxide solution (30%), and anti-bumping granules.<br>
 Distil the mixture.<br>
 Test for ammonia in the distillate.<br>
 For volumetric titration, pass all the ammonia through 1 M acid solution.<br>
 The ammonia neutralizes some acid.<br>
 Titrate the acid left over with an alkali to find how much acid used by the ammonia.<br>
2. Repeat the experiment with 5 g egg albumen (eggwhite).<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2">16.5.8 Tests for pectin in jelly and jam<br>
1. To test whether fruit juice has enough pectin for jelly, stir together 5 mL (1 tsp) of fruit juice with 15 mL (1 tbsp) of methylated spirits.<br>
 If the juice forms one big clot, which can be picked up with a fork without breaking, it has sufficient pectin.<br>
 If the juice is low in pectin, several small clots will form.<br>
 This is a poisonous mixture, so do not taste it and discard it immediately after the test.<br>
 If fruit juice contains too much pectin, it flows slowly, so add sugar.<br>
 If the pectin is low, add apples, crabapple, chokecherry, which are high in pectin, to assure gelation.<br>
 Boil the juice to concentrate the pectin.<br>
 However, heating vigorously can break down the pectin with a loss of gelling power and flavour.<br>
<a name="16.5.9H">
2. Test for pectin every minute.<br>
 Once the clot forms, add only 175 mL (3/4 cup) sugar for every 250 mL (1 cup) juice.<br>
 Measure fruit juice pH.<br>
 Best gelation occurs if pH is between 3.1 and 3.4.<br>
 If pH is too high, the jelly is watery and will not set.<br>
3. To make pectin, combine 1 kg of sliced unpeeled crabapples and 750 mL of water.<br>
 Simmer 30 to 40 minutes, adding water as needed.<br>
 Drain and press through moistened cheesecloth.<br>
 To clear, heat the juice and pour through a moistened jelly bag.<br>
 If a good pectin clot is obtained, bring the juice to a boil and freeze the pectin for later use.<br>
 If a clot does not form, simmer gently to reduce the water content of the juice.<br>
Usually, 1000 mL (4 cups) of homemade pectin replaces 85 mL of liquid pectin.<br>

 Be careful! Children must not taste the test solutions!<br>
 Young children may be distressed by the sight of the water flea (Daphnia pulex) struggling under the influence of these substances.<br>
 However, such a sight can send a powerful deterrent message about substance abuse.<br>
 Collect (Daphnia) in spring from ponds or purchase from goldfish supply shops.<br>
1. Prepare the following test solutions in test-tubes:<br>
* Use 10 mL coffee from a coffee cup containing 1 teaspoon of coffee powder, or the usual way you make coffee (active ingredient caffeine).<br>
* Use 10 mL cooking sherry, 17% alcohol / volume active ingredient.<br>
2. Stir the following substances into 10 mL water at 37oC<br>
* Use 300 mg aspirin tablet, active ingredient acetylsalicylic acid,<br>
* Use 1 g pipe tobacco or the contents of discarded cigarette butts, active ingredient nicotine,<br>
* Use 1 Benadryl allergy caplet, active ingredient diphenhydramine.<br>
3. Use an eye dropper to transfer a (Daphnia) to 5 test-tubes containing 10 mL pond water.<br>
 Transfer 1, 2, 3, 4 drops of test solution into test-tubes 1, 2, 3, 4.<br>
 Put no test solution in the control test-tube.<br>
4. Use a microscope to observe movement, heart rate and gill movement of (Daphnia) in the control test-tube.<br>
5. Use test-tubes 1 to 4 to record the least number of drops of test solution to kill the (Daphnia).<br>
Tobacco causes quick death at the lowest doses.<br>
Alcohol first slows the heartbeat rate, then is lethal at higher doses.<br>
Aspirin and allergy capsules are lethal at the highest doses.<br>
Coffee causes "racing" of the heart, heart palpitations, but is not lethal.<br>
6. Repeat the experiment with the following:<br>
* Decaffeinated coffee,<br>
* Red wine 12.5% alcohol / volume,<br>
* 100 mg low dose "baby" aspirin,<br>
* "Lite" low nicotine cigarettes.<br>
* "Red Bull" sports drink contains caffeine.<br>

1. To make whisky, barley is soaked in water then allowed to germinate until roots and shoots form.<br>
During this germination enzymes are produced that can convert starch to fermentable sugars.<br>
The germinated grain (green malt), is then dried over a smoky peat fire to stop further germination.<br>
The malt is ground to form grist that is mixed with hot water then put in a large container, a mash tun, for further germination to form a weak alcoholic solution, to be distilled into casks to form whisky.<br>
The taste of whisky comes mainly from the smoke of the peat fire.<br>
2. "Dried yeast" (active granules), baker's yeast, living yeast, contain "bakers' yeast", an emulsifier, e.g. emulsifier 491, potato flour and a vegetable gum, e.g. 414.<br>
3. In sauerkraut manufacture, lactic acid bacteria convert sugar in cabbage into 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, (lactic acid).<br>
4. Fermented fish sauce, garum, made usually from anchovies, tuna, eel and mackerel, was popular during the Roman empire and is still made in Vietnam and other Asian countries.<br>
5. Beer is made from a malted grain, barley, wheat or rye.<br>
 Malt is made by allowing a grain to germinate, then dried.<br>
 During germination enzymes, e.g. alfa-amylase and beta-amylase, converts starch in the grain to sugar.<br>
 The malt is crushed then the grist is mixed with heated water, mashing.<br>
 The mashing allows enzymes to break down starch into sugars, e.g. maltose, activates beta-glucanase to breaks down beta-glucans and activate proteinases to break down proteins.<br>
 The colour of beer comes from the use of roasted malt and unmalted grains.<br>
 During the mashing process, enzymes present in the grain convert starches to sugars.<br>
 The "head" on beer contains proteins.<br>
 Later, the mash temperature is raised to deactivate enzymes.<br>
 After the mashing, the liquid, now called wort, is strained from the grains.<br>
 The wort is boiled with hops to end enzymatic processes, precipitate proteins, isomerize hop resins, concentrate and sterilize the wort.<br>
 The hops add flavour, aroma and bitterness to the beer.<br>
 The wort is filtered then yeast is added to convert the sugars from the malt into alcohol, carbon dioxide by fermentation or glycolysis.<br>
 Later the beer is cooled, yeast removed, the beer is left to "lager" or rest.<br>

 <a name="AlesH">Ales</a><br>
Ales are top-fermented beers are brewed at a higher temperature when the ale yeast form a foam on the surface of the fermenting beer.<br>
 Ales are more fruity and aromatic with a richer, creamier feel in the mouth.<br>
 Ales range in colour from very pale to black opaque.<br>
 Lagers are brewed at a lower temperature when the yeast sinks to the bottom.<br>
 Lagers are left at a cold temperature to produce a cleaner style of beer with fewer aromatics.<br>
 Nowadays most beers are lagers, e.g. Pilsner, originally made in Pilsen, Czech Republic.<br>
 Beers brewed around Brussels, Belgium, lambic beers, are fermented by wild yeast strains from near the Zenne river.<br>
The bitter taste comes from the alpha acids, e.g. cis- and trans-isohumulone, in the resin glands of hops flowers used during the boiling of the wort.<br>
 Early "hoppng" increases bitterness.<br>
 Late "hopping" increases aromatic tastes.<br>
 Traditional ale is made from malted barley, hops, yeast and water.<br>
