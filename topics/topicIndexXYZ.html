Senior chemistry.<br>
Chemical systems may be open or closed.<br>   
Physical changes are usually reversible, whereas only some chemical reactions are reversible.<br>   
Observable changes in chemical reactions and physical changes can be described and explained at an atomic and molecular level.<br>   
Equilibrium equations can be symbolized by using ⇋ in balanced chemical equations.<br> 
Eventually, physical changes & reversible chemical reactions reach a state of dynamic equilibrium in a closed system.<br>   
The reversibility of chemical reactions can be explained by considering Ea of the forward and reverse reactions.<br>   
Use the relative changes in the concentration of reactants and product against time, to identify the position of equilibrium.<br>   
Factors affecting equilibrium 
The effect of temperature change on chemical systems at equilibrium can be explained by considering the enthalpy change for the forward and reverse reactions.<br>   
Le Châtelier’s principle can be used to predict the effect changes of temperature, concentration of chemicals, pressure and the addition of a catalyst have on the position of equilibrium and on the value of the equilibrium constant.<br>   
Equilibrium constants
The equilibrium constant (Kc), at any given temperature, indicates the relationship between product and reactant concentrations at equilibrium.<br>   
Use equilibrium constants (Kc), to predict qualitatively, the relative amounts of reactants and products (equilibrium position).<br> 
The extent of a reaction can be deduced from the magnitude of the equilibrium constant.<br> 
Properties of acids & bases 
Acids are substances that can act as proton (hydrogen ion) donors and can be classified as monoprotic or polyprotic depending on the number of protons donated by each molecule of the acid.<br> 
Strong & weak acids & bases can be described in terms of the extent of dissociation, reaction with water & electrical conductivity.<br>  
Water is a weak electrolyte and the self-ionisation of water is represented by Kw = [H+][OH-]; Kw can be used to calculate the concentration of hydrogen ions from the concentration of hydroxide ions in a solution.<br>   
The pH scale is a logarithmic scale and the pH of a solution can be calculated from the concentration of hydrogen ions using the relationship pH = –log10[H+].<br>   
Brønsted-Lowry model 
The relationship between acids & bases in equilibrium systems can be explained using the Brønsted-Lowry model & represented using chemical equations that illustrate the transfer of H+ (protons) between conjugate acid-base pairs.<br>   
Buffers are solutions that are conjugate in nature & resist a change in pH when a small amount of an acid or base is added; Le Châtelier’s principle can be applied to predict how buffer solutions respond to the addition of hydrogen ions & hydroxide ions.<br>
