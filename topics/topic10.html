<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.1.2H">10.1.2</a> Separate efficiency of a mixture<br>
Use one of two mixtures:<br>
1. sand, pebbles, salt and oil,<br>
2. sand, iron filings, wood shavings and salt.<br>
Determine the mass off each of the components before mixing them.<br>
When the components are separated again, find the efficiency of the separation process from the recovery percentage for each component.<br>
Analyse potential sources of any differences seen:<br>
1. not washing the filtrate with distilled water, thus leaving a residue behind, or<br>
2. adherence of one material to another.<br>
Repeat the experiment, by improving the efficiency of their separation, and then comparing the recovery percentage of the first trial vs the second trial.<br>
Evaluate the efficacy of different separation techniques, and discus different types of error.<br>
Think about the impact of equipment error on laboratory investigations.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.1.3H">10.1.3</a> Separate by adsorbing impurities<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.1.5H">10.1.5</a> Separate salt from salt water by evaporation<br>
 Put a finger width of sodium chloride in a half a test-tube of hot water and shake the test-tube to dissolve the salt.<br>
 When any undissolved salt has settled, pour the solution into an evaporating basin on a tripod stand.<br>
 Put on safety glasses then heat the evaporating basin until the solution boils.<br>
 Keep the solution boiling until all the water evaporates as steam and a white residue of salt remains.<br>
 However, if the salt begins to spurt out of the evaporating basin, heat very slowly.<br>
 Do not taste the salt.<br>
 Place the evaporating basin in the sun or in front of a radiator to dry the contents completely.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.1.7H">10.1.7</a> Separate sand and salt mixture<br>
 1. Shake salt in water in a test-tube until all the salt dissolves.<br>
 Filter the mixture.<br>
 Wash the test-tube with water and pour it into the cone of filter paper.<br>
 Dry the filter paper to recover the sand.<br>
 Heat the filtrate in an evaporating dish to recover the salt.<br>
 2. Make a mixture of salt and sand.<br>
 Mix 5 g of the sand and salt mixture with 50 mL of water.<br>
 Put about 2 mL of the mixture in an evaporating basis.<br>
 Add 5 mL water and shake until all the salt has dissolved.<br>
 Pour the contents of the tube into a filter paper in a funnel over an evaporating basin.<br>
 Wash the test-tube with water and add this to the filter paper.<br>
 The sand will remain on the filter paper and may be dried and collected.<br>
  Recover the salt by heating the mixture in an evaporating basin to drive off the water until the mixture starts to "spit".<br>
 Stop the heating and allow the moist salt to dry.<br>
 3. Mix a finger width each of sand and salt.<br>
 Put the mixture in a test-tube half full of hot water.<br>
 Shake the test-tube to make the salt dissolve.<br>
 Filter the mixture and collect the salt water filtrate in an evaporating basin.<br>
 Wear eye protection then heat the salt solution with a Bunsen burner.<br>
 When the salt solution starts to "spit", i.e. sends out small explosions of damp salt, turn off the Bunsen burner and leave the damp salt in the sun to dry.<br>

 Mix a finger width each of sand and copper sulfate crystals.<br>
 Put the mixture in a test-tube half full of hot water.<br>
 Shake the test-tube to make the copper sulfate dissolve.<br>
 Filter the mixture and collect the copper sulfate filtrate in a test-tube.<br>
 Heat the test-tube, but do not completely evaporate the solution.<br>
 When half of it has boiled away and the remaining liquid is a deeper blue colour, pour it into an evaporating basin.<br>
 Leave it on the bench until blue crystals of copper sulfate form.<br>
 Place the evaporating basin in the sun or in front of a radiator to dry the contents completely.<br>
 Store and label the dry copper sulfate crystals.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.1.9H">10.1.9 </a> Separate by different methods<br>
 1. Separate a solution of calcium chloride and sodium chloride by adding a solution of sodium carbonate to precipitate calcium as insoluble calcium carbonate.<br>
Both Cacl2 and Na2CO3 are soluble in water and dissociated completely to ions.<br>
The calcium will precipitate in a white precipitate as CaCO3, because :<br>
CaCl2 (aq) + Na2CO3 (aq) --> 2 NaCl (aq) + CaCO3 (s)<br>
and NaCl is highly soluble in water.<br>
 This is a chemical separation technique.<br>
 2. Sulfide ores are roasted to oxides and then reduced to the metals.<br>
 For example, in the metallurgy of iron, iron ore is roasted in a blast furnace, and then reduced to metallic iron by carbon.<br>
 3. Noble metals like gold and silver are converted into their soluble cyanide complexes, which are later recovered after separation from insoluble impurities.<br>
 4. Organic compounds are separated by converting them in to their derivatives by adding reagents and recovered after removal of impurities.<br>
 5. Activated carbon removing colours and odours from organic compounds, e.g. butter absorbing the perfume of roses.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.1.10H">10.1.10</a> Separate alum from alum solution by crystallization<br>
 Common alum is aluminium potassium sulfate.<br>
 Add a finger width of alum to a quarter of a test-tube of hot water.<br>
 Shake the test-tube to dissolve the alum.<br>
 Keep shaking until no more alum will dissolve and some alum remains on the bottom of the test-tube.<br>
 Pour a finger width of this hot saturated solution into the evaporating basin and leave to cool for a few hours.<br>
 Note the shape of the alum crystals.<br>
 They form diamond-shaped double pyramids.<br>
 Store and label the dry alum crystals.<br>
 Repeat the experiment using magnesium sulfate instead of alum.<br>
 Store and label the dry magnesium sulfate crystals.<br>
 Repeat the experiment using sodium carbonate instead of alum.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.1.11H">10.1.11</a> Separate copper carbonate and magnesium sulfate mixture<br>
 Mix solid copper carbonate with magnesium sulfate crystals.<br>
 Put the solid chemicals on a folded piece of clean paper and mix them with a spatula.<br>
 Pour the mixture into a test-tube.<br>
 Add hot water and stir the mixture to dissolve the magnesium sulfate.<br>
 Filter the mixture to form a residue of copper carbonate on the filter paper.<br>
 Wash the residue on the filter paper and leave to dry.<br>
 Evaporate the filtrate of magnesium sulfate solution to form magnesium sulfate crystals.<br>
 Store and label the dry magnesium sulfate crystals.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.1.12H">10.1.12</a> Separate soluble from insoluble substances<br>
Shake a mixture of sand and sodium chloride in a test-tube containing water.<br>
Filter the mixture into an evaporating basin.<br>
Heat the filtrate to form sodium chloride crystals.<br>
Sodium chloride, the solute, dissolves in water, the solvent, to form a solution.<br>
Sand is insoluble in water.<br>
Repeat the experiment with a mixture of ammonium chloride and sulfur.<br>
The sulfur is insoluble in water.<br>
The ammonium chloride is soluble in water and can be recovered by filtration and evaporation of the filtrate.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.1.13H">10.1.13</a> Separate dirt from dirty water with charcoal<br>
 Make dirty water by adding to muddy water drops of: methyl orange, aqueous ammonia solution, calcium nitrate solution, barium sulfate (VI) solution.<br>
 Wash sand with tap water then deionized water.<br>
 Put washed sand on filter paper in a filter funnel.<br>
 Filter the dirty water through the sand.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.2.1H">10.2.1</a> Chromatography of chlorophyll pigments<br>
 Chloroplasts derive their colour from several pigments (carotenes, xanthophylls
and chlorophylls), which are present in differing 
 amounts, the proportions varying with species.<br>
 You can separate them by paper chromatography.<br>
 1. Cut grass into small pieces and place them in a mortar.<br>
 Add sand, 40 mL methanol and 5 mL petroleum benzene and grind the mixture vigorously for two minutes with the pestle.<br>
 Pour a few mL of the bright green solution of crude chlorophyll obtained into a test-tube.<br>
 Add 1 mL of deionized water and shake well.<br>
 Leave the test-tube to stand.<br>
 Most of the pigment passes into the petroleum benzene layer that settles on top of the diluted methanol.<br>
2. Heat the centre area of a hollow glass tube in a Bunsen burner flame while rotating the tube slowly.<br>
 When the central area is sufficiently soft, move your hands away from each other to draw out the hot glass in the middle to form a fine capillary tube.<br>
 After cooling, snap the capillary in two at the centre, thus producing two small pipettes with very finely drawn tips called Pasteur pipettes.<br>
 Use one pipette to take a sample of the petroleum benzene containing the crude chlorophyll layer settled in the upper part of the test-tube.<br>
 Apply the sample in a line 2 mm wide to a strip of chromatographic paper so that the line is parallel to and 2 cm from the narrow edges of the strip.<br>
 The coloured line should not touch the edges of the chromatographic strip.<br>
 Prepare more applications to ensure that you have put enough pigment on the paper.<br>
 Let the solution dry after each application to prevent the coloured line from spreading too widely.<br>
 Leave to dry.<br>
3. Pour eluting solvent to a height of 2 cm into a measuring cylinder.<br>
 Fix the chromatographic strip between the two halves of the vertically cut cork and suspend it inside the cylinder.<br>
 Push the strip far enough down so that you immerse 1 cm of its lower end in the eluting solvent, but keep the line of pigment above the solvent level.<br>
 The strip must not touch the inside wall of the cylinder, otherwise, the reagent will not rise evenly.<br>
 Seal the measuring cylinder with a stopper so that the atmosphere surrounding the chromatographic strip is saturated with the vapour of the eluting solvent.<br>
 Watch the solvent rising up the chromatographic strip.<br>
 After 15 minutes, remove the strip from the cylinder, mark the height reached by the solvent with a pencil line and allow the strip to dry in air.<br>
 Note the different bands of colour and their pattern of distribution.<br>
 Carotene is orange yellow, xanthophyll is lemon yellow, chlorophyll a is blue green and chlorophyll b is yellow green.<br>
 Use a pencil to outline and label the different bands of colour.<br>
Chlorophylls decompose on exposure to light, so do this experiment in the shade.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.2.2H">10.2.2</a> Detect a forgery<br>
 Write a cheque for one dollar ($1).<br>
 Use a different pen with the same colour ink to change the amount to one million dollars ($1 000 000).<br>
 Dip the edge of the cheque in chromatography solution.<br>
 The ink from the 1 behaves differently from the added zeros!<br>
 Arrest the forger!<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.2.3H">10.2.3</a> Separate by chromatography, "colour writing"<br>
 Chromatography, "colour writing", is used for chemical analysis and separation.<br>
 Chromatography uses the property that some chemicals have preferential adsorption on the surface of other materials.<br>
So chemicals absorbed at different rates can be separated.<br>
 Different substances or different components move at different speeds through a strip of wet paper, a gel, or a gas.<br>
 To separate colourless substances, spray a locating agent on the paper to colour the separated spots.<br>
 During chromatography, a mixture of different solutes, the moving phase, pass over an absorbing medium, the stationary phase.<br>
 Different solutes tend to stay longer or shorter in the moving phase.<br>
 In paper chromatography, the paper and solvent adsorbed to the paper is the stationary phase.<br>
 In thin layer chromatography, the stationary phase is a layer on a plastic or glass plate.<br>
 In column chromatography, the stationary phase substance is packed in a tube.<br>
Experiments<br>
 1. Separate by column chromatography.<br>
 Use a piece of white chalk as a column.<br>
 Draw a line around the chalk 2 cm from the larger end with mixed ink made up of red and blue ink in equal quantity.<br>
 Turn this end upside down and let the chalk stand in a Petri dish containing water with the ink line being above the water level.<br>
 The water acts as a developing agent.<br>
 The water is drawn up the column and raises the mixed ink.<br>
 The red component of the mixed ink moves up faster than the blue component.<br>
 The component colours of the mixed ink are separated to produce two different coloured bands with red above and blue below.<br>
 2. Use a test-tube with a small hole in the bottom blocked by a plug of cotton wool.<br>
 Fill the test-tube with powdered chalk packed down lightly with a pencil.<br>
 Pour drops of an equal mixture of ink and water on top of the chalk column.<br>
 The ink mixture moves down the column producing different coloured bands.<br>
 This set of coloured bands is a chromatogram.<br>
 Each band represents a component of the ink.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.2.4H">10.2.4</a> Separate by chromatography, green leaf pigments<br>
<a href="../images/3.2.24ch.gif">See diagram 3.2.24</a>: Chromatography.<br>
 1. Collect green leaves and cut them into very small pieces.<br>
 Use a mortar and pestle to grind the leaves for five minutes with a small volume of methylated spirits and clean sand until a deep green solution forms.<br>
 Draw a fine pencil line 5 cm from the end of a 1 cm wide strip of absorbent paper (or chromatography paper).<br>
 Suspend the absorbent paper in a test-tube without touching the bottom.<br>
 Use a fine eye-dropper to put one small drop of the solution on the centre of the fine pencil line and let it dry.<br>
 When the drop is dry add more solution to the same place to make a small concentrated spot of 5 drops.<br>
 Hang the paper strip with the lower end in the methylated spirits solvent and the spot of green solution above the solvent level.<br>
 Leave the paper strip in the solvent until the methylated spirits has almost reached the top of the absorbent paper.<br>
 Capillary attraction draws up the solvent.<br>
 Mark the chromatogram on the paper to show a top orange-yellow band of xanthophyll and a lower green band of chlorophyll.<br>
 A band of carotene is visible if the solvent is toluene.<br>
 2. Repeat the experiment with other solvents, e.g. toluene, acetone (propanone).<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.2.5H">10.2.5</a> Separate by chromatography, mixed inks<br>
 Prepare a mixed solvent from 6 parts of water, 3 parts of methylated spirits, and 1 part of ammonia solution.<br>
 Put 5 mL of mixed solvent in a test-tube.<br>
 Prepare mixed ink from equal quantities of red and blue ink.<br>
 Put a drop of the mixed ink near one end of a 2 cm wide paper strip.<br>
 Lower the paper strip so that its lower end is in the mixed solvent.<br>
 Use a stopper to prevent evaporation.<br>
 As the solvent moves up the paper strip, the component colours of the ink separate to form different coloured bands with red above and blue below.<br>
 Try other solvents and other inks to obtain good separation of colours.<br>
 Repeat the experiment by drawing a line with a ball pen or an ink pen near the end of the paper strip.<br>

 1. Use this method for sweets where the colour is dispersed through the sweet, e.g. jelly beans.<br>
 This method uses white thread to separate the extracted dye from the extracted sugar.<br>
 This method extracts only acid dyes.<br>
 Prepare white woollen thread: Use 1 metre of prepared wool for each colour of the jelly beans.<br>
 Boil one metre of white woollen thread for 10 minutes in 2% ammonia solution, rinse under the tap to remove fluorescing dyes, then dry.<br>
 Add 25 mL of warm water to 5 jelly beans of each colour in 5 different containers and leave to stand until they look white.<br>
 The solutions now contain dye and sugar, which can be separated by dyeing the wool.<br>
 For each colour, put a 1 metre piece of prepared white woollen thread in a 100 mL beaker and add the dye extract.<br>
 Add 3 drops of 0.1 M acetic acid.<br>
 Heat until boiling and simmer for 5 minutes.<br>
 Remove the dyed wool and wash gently under the tap until no stickiness remains.<br>
 Re-extract the dye from the wool by placing it in a beaker containing 20 mL of 2% ammonia solution and simmer for 5 minutes.<br>
 Remove the wool from the beaker.<br>
 Evaporate the extract in the beaker to dryness on a hot plate in a fume cupboard.<br>
 Ammonia will be given off.<br>
 Dissolve the dry residue, with constant stirring, in the minimum number of drops of water to maintain high concentration.<br>
 Use a capillary tube spotter to make &lt; 2 cm spots of solutions of each colour.<br>
 Use the following solvent mixture: butanol: ethanol: 2% ammonia, in a 3: 1: 1 ratio.<br>
 2. Use this method for sweets where the colour is only on the outside layer of the sweet, e.g. "Smarties".<br>
 Wet the surface of the sweet then rub it directly on chromatography paper.<br>
 To simplify the separation, dip the paper in 1% sodium chloride solution to reduce the electrostatic attractive forces between the dye and paper molecules.<br>

| <a href="../images/1.13a.gif">See 1.13a</a>: Simple fume hood.<br>
 An azeotropic mixture has a boiling point that does not change when vapour is removed by evaporation.<br>
 The boiling point may be higher or lower than any of the components of the mixture, e.g. A toluene / water mixture has BP. 85.0<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 However, BP. toluene is 110.6<sup>o</sup>C and BP. water is 100.0<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 Steam distillation is used to separate volatile from non-volatile components and the reduction in boiling point reduces thermal decomposition.<br>
 For the toluene-water system, below 85<sup>o</sup>C the two liquid phases coexist.<br>
 At 85<sup>o</sup>C the sum of the vapour pressures of water and toluene = one atmosphere, and boiling starts.<br>
 In a mixture of toluene and water, boiling occurs at 85<sup>o</sup>C and both water and toluene are in the vapour that condenses to form two layers.<br>
 The bottom layer of water has 0.06% toluene dissolved in it.<br>
 The top layer of toluene has 0.05% water dissolved in it.<br>
 The relative volumes are 18% water and 82% toluene.<br>
 The excess toluene flows back into the flask and distils back over with more water.<br>
 At 85<sup>o</sup>C, vapour pressure of water = 57.7 kPa and vapour pressure of toluene = 50.6 kPa.<br>
 Weight of water = (molar mass water / molar mass toluene) × (vapour pressure water / vapour pressure toluene) = (18 / 92) × (57.7 / 50.6) = 0.223 = 20%.<br>
 Be careful! Do experiment in a fume cupboard, fume hood, because toluene vapour is harmful.<br>
 You can substitute less harmful cyclohexane for toluene.<br>
 However, it is less efficient, carrying over only 8.5% water.<br>
 Use the apparatus to find the amount of water and fat in food<br>
For example:  minced meat for hamburgers 13% fat and 67% water, minced meat for sausages 26% fat and 47% water.<br>
 1. Water content<br>
 Distil 20 g minced meat or chopped cheese with 80 mL of toluene until no more water distils over at 110.6<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 Weigh the bottom layer of water.<br>
 2. Fat content<br>
 Pour the remaining toluene from the flask into a pre-weighed beaker.<br>
 Add more toluene to the food in the flask and shake the flask vigorously to extract all the fat.<br>
 Add this toluene to the beaker.<br>
 Evaporate all the toluene under a fume cupboard, fume hood using a water bath and vacuum pump to leave the fat in the beaker that can be weighed.<br>

 Blow air through the mixture to form froth.<br>
 The metal-containing mineral particles or powdered metal particles become covered with the oil, because of attraction of the oil for them.<br>
 The particles stick to the air bubbles that floating on the surface along with the rising froth.<br>
 The water wets the gangue particles or sand particles and they sink to the bottom, separating the mineral or metal from the mixture.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.9.0H">10.9.0</a> Separate by recrystallization<br>
 Crystallization involves the formation of a pure solid from its solution.<br>
 Make a saturated solution of the material in a hot solvent and let the hot solution cool.<br>
 When the impurity is present in large amounts, the liquid becomes saturated with both materials and does not separate them.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.9.1H">10.9.1</a> Separate a mixture of sodium chloride and sodium nitrate<br>
 Dissolve sodium chloride in 20 mL of water at 70<sup>o</sup>C, until the solution is saturated.<br>
 Add sodium nitrate until no more dissolves.<br>
 Boil the solution filter and cool.<br>
 Sodium nitrate is much more soluble than sodium chloride in hot water, so, on cooling, more sodium nitrate than sodium chloride crystallizes out as the solution cools.<br>
 The crystals can dissolve again and cool again.<br>
 Each time this is done the sodium nitrate becomes more pure.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.10.0H">10.10.0</a> Separate to metals 
 by reduction of metal oxides, charcoal blocks.<br>
 1. Ores are deposits of compounds that contain metals.<br>
 Ores occur naturally in the ground.<br>
 Metals or minerals are extracted from ores by different processes leaving behind the waste material gangue (called "gang").<br>
 Leaching extracts minerals by dissolving in a chemical, e.g. sulfuric acid or sodium hydroxide.<br>
 Groundwater may be contaminated by chemicals leached from mine tailings or refuse.<br>
 2. Use charcoal blocks to demonstrate reduction reactions.<br>
 Ensure that students have any long hair confined before blowing air through a blowpipe onto a Bunsen burner flame.<br>
 Use a clean flexible tube attached to the blow pipe to avoid having to lean close to the Bunsen burner and blocks.<br>
 Ensure that blow pipes are washed between student use to prevent transfer of diseases.<br>
 3. Do not reduce oxides of toxic metals such as mercury, lead, cadmium, nickel, arsenic or antimony, because students may inhale fine particles.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.11.1H">10.11.1</a> Separate by decanting<br>
<a href="../images/2.12.gif">See diagram 2.12</a>: Decanting<br>
Decant, pour off liquid and not disturb underlying sediment.<br>
 Decanting separates the precipitate by inclining the test-tube or other container so that the level of the liquid rises above the level of the  lip of the container so that it can be poured off the precipitate.<br>
 Formerly, wine was decanted before drinking into a container called a decanter to separate organic particles formed during the maturation of ine, e.g. tartaric acid.<br>
 Another reason for decanting wine was to expose wine to the air to release favourable odours.<br>
 Shaking the wine to allow more access to air may result in unfavourable oxidation products.<br>
 Nowadays, there is less need or no need to decant wine before drinking it, because of the use of the Stelvin capsule and modern  methods of filtration.<br>
 The "damp cardboard" taste of corky wine is caused usually by 2,4,6-Trichloroanisole, Cl3C6H2OCH3, (2,4,6-TCA) mould.<br>
 It is produced by Trichoderma and Fusarium strains of fungi in contact with chlorine used to bleach corks, from the bark of the cork tree, Quercus suber, Fagaceae.<br>
 The waiters in high class restaurants will smell the cork before first pouring the newly-opened wine to detect any unpleasant odours.<br>
 The taint taste of 2,4,6-TCA may also cause the "Rio" defect in South American coffee and affect beer, sake and fish and prawns.<br>
 The wine cork is being replaced by screw-top caps to seal wine bottles, e.g. the Stelvin capsule, "Stelvin Lux", that seals the bottle.<br>
 The Stelvin capsule is popular in only a few countres, i.e. Australia.<br>
However, itt allows a very small amount of air to touch the surface of the wine to allow maturation.<br>
 Although the screw-top capsule prevents "corkiness", the taste of the wine may still be affected by excess exposure to the air if the cork is loose.<br>
 Excessive oxidation of wine may cause unpleasant odour and bad tastes
 Corked wines are usually stored horizontally to keep the cork moist and prevent cork shrinkage.<br>

<a href="../images/2.14.gif">See diagram 2.14</a>: Fold filter paper<br>
 Filtration uses filter papers for chemical precipitates and sand for sewage precipitates.<br>
 Filtration allows the liquid to pass through the filter and restrain the solid particles on the filter.<br>

 Calcium hydroxide precipitates as a milky precipitate when breathing into limewater.<br>
 To precipitate is to cause a substance to be deposited in solid from a solution, so a precipitate is a solid substance separated from a solution.<br>
 The precipitate can be separated from the solution by decanting or by filtration.<br>

 1. Shake muddy water in a measuring cylinder and let it stand.<br>
 The larger particles separate first and the smaller and the lighter particles remain longer in suspension.<br>
 Decant the liquid containing the suspended particles and filter through filter paper.<br>
 Slowly heat the larger particle to dryness and leave the filter paper in the sun to dry.<br>
 Feel the larger particles and the smaller particles collected by the filter paper.<br>
2. Shake muddy water in a measuring cylinder and let it stand.<br>
 Divide the suspension into two measuring cylinders.<br>
 Add 5 cc flocculating agent potash alum, Al2(SO4)3.K2(SO4).24H2O, [also shown as KAl(SO4)2.12H2O] to one of the measuring cylinders.<br>
 The treated water begins to clarify as the colloid particles begin to clump together, flocculate, and settle to the bottom.<br>
 Another flocculating agent used to clarify muddy water is SIROFLOC.<br>
 Muddy water contains soil held as a colloid.<br>
 During flocculation, charged ions gather around particles with opposite charge.<br>
 When colloids suspended in a solvent are no longer suspended in a solvent, they fall down to form a loose woolly mass, a flocculent.<br>
 Flocculation is used in water treatment and swimming pool management to separate out visible sediments, and treat colloids to remove them.<br>

<a href="../images/13.15.3ch.gif">See diagram 13.15.3</a>: Iodine extraction.<br>
 Iodine is one of the micro elements necessary for the human body.<br>
 Sea water contains about 0.000005% of iodine that can be absorbed and concentrated by some marine living beings.<br>
 There are 1000-4000 mg of iodine existing as iodides in kelp of per thousand grams.<br>
 Burning kelp gathers the iodides in ashes.<br>
 Decoct the ashes in water, acidify the resultant iodide solution and then evaporate it to dryness.<br>
 The follow up oxidation with potassium dichromate produces iodine, which is then separated by sublimation.<br>
 K2Cr2O7 + 6KI + 7H2SO4 --> 4K2SO4 + Cr2(SO4)3 + 3I2 + 7H2O<br>
 Weigh and cut 40 g of dried kelp into small pieces and put them in an iron vessel.<br>
 Burn the kelp chips with an electric heater in a fume cupboard until all the chips are completely turned into ash.<br>
 Transfer the ashes to a beaker, add 40 mL of deionized water, heat and boil the suspension, and add more water to make the filtrate 10 mL after filtering.<br>
 Add drop by drop dilute sulfuric acid (2 mol / L) to the filtrate until its value of pH becomes neutral.<br>
 Put the neutralized filtrate in an evaporating dish, evaporate it by heating to dryness.<br>
 The residues are parched and ground and uniformly mixed with 2 g of potassium dichromate.<br>
 Transfer the mixture to a dry tall beaker.<br>
 Stand a flask containing cold water on the mouth of the beaker.<br>
 On heating the beaker to sublimate the produced iodine, iodine vapour condenses on the cooler sides of the flask.<br>
 Stop heating when there is no violet red iodine vapour appearing any more.<br>
 Collect the obtained iodine crystals.<br>

 Distilling petroleum or mixtures of petroleum products may be too dangerous for most school science classes.<br>
 Use crude oil or a substitute for crude oil by used car oil, paraffin, thin lubricating oil, diesel oil and petroleum jelly.<br>
1. Use crude oil or a substitute for crude oil, e.g. a mixture of used car oil, paraffin, thin lubricating oil, diesel oil and petroleum jelly.<br>
Use a hard glass test-tube, or sidearm test-tube, fixed to a retort stand, a delivery tube and five small ignition tubes.<br>
Use a 0o to 360oC thermometer.<br>
Put 4 mL of crude oil in the test-tube.<br>
Add boiling chips to prevent bumping.<br>
Set up five small ignition tubes to collect the fractions.<br>
Heat the oil very gently.
Collect 10 drops of distillate in the first ignition tube, then collect 10 drops of distillate successively in the other ignition tubes.<br>
The boiling point of the remaining oil will become higher as distillation proceeds and oil will then require more heat from the Bunsen burner.<br>
2. Arrange the fractions in order of increasing distillation temperature:<br>
* up to 80oC,<br>
* 80oC to 120oC,<br>
* 120oC to 180oC,<br>
* 180oC to 220oC.<br>
3. Examine the different fractions:<br>
* The colour should change from colourless to yellow.<br>
* The viscosity should increase.<br>
* The high temperature fractions should be more difficult to ignite than the low temperature fractions.<br>
* The high temperature fractions should burn with more soot in the flame than low temperature fractions.<br>
* Burn the fractions in bottle tops with the cork removed and note the dark residue remaining in the test-tubes.<br>
