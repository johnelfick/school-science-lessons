by Dr Hugh Cartwright, Chemistry Department, Oxford University<br>
 Toxicity is the capacity of a substance to cause harm.<br>
 All chemicals should be considered as partially toxic.<br>
 The toxicity of a substance is determined by the quantity of that substance required to cause harm.<br>
 Risks of injury associated with any particular chemical relate directly to the route of entry, i.e. ingestion, inhalation or skin contact.<br>
 A substance that may be very toxic by ingestion may be quite safe to handle if it is not ingested.<br>
 Toxicity is usually reported as an LD50 oral rate, i.e.  the lethal dose that will kill 50% of a sample rat population if administered orally.<br>
 The following values are approximate indicators for ingestion:<br>
| <b>very toxic</b>: LD50 &lt; 25 mg / kg body weight | <b>toxic</b>: LD50&lt; 200 mg / kg body weight | <b>harmful</b>: LD50 &lt; 2000 mg / kg body weight.<br>
The following chemicals are poisons and should never be used in a school laboratory:<br>
| carbon tetrachloride CCl4, (tetrachloromethane) | carbon disulfide CS2 | chloroform CCl3 | mercury Hg, (mercury metal, all mercury salts) | phenol C6H5OH, (carbolic acid) | phosphorus, P (white phosphorus, yellow phosphorus) |.<br>

<a name="3.9H">3.9</a> Carcinogenic substances<br>
Carcinogen, from "Health hazards" (Draft Australian criteria for the classification of hazardous chemicals)<br>
Carcinogen means a substance or a mixture of substances that induce  cancer or increase its incidence.<br>
Substances and mixtures that have induced benign and malignant tumours in experimental studies on animals are considered also to be presumed or suspected 
 human carcinogens, unless there is strong evidence that the mechanism of tumour formation is not relevant for humans.<br>
 Substances and preparations that, if they are inhaled or ingested or if they penetrate the skin, may induce cancer or increase its incidence.<br>
 1-naphthol, C10H7OH, α-naphthol, 1-hydroxynaphthalene, naphthalene-1-ol, Toxic if ingested,  may form carcinogenic compounds<br>

<a name="4.1H">4.1</a> Aluminium toxicity<br>
 The metal aluminium itself is not generally regarded as a poison.<br>
 The toxicity of any compound will be determined by the nature of the anion with which the metal is combined.<br>
 Alum, potassium alum, has the formula: Al2(SO4)3.K2(SO4).24H2O.<br>
 
<a name="4.2H">4.2</a> Barium toxicity<br>
 The soluble barium salts such as the chloride and sulfide are poisonous when taken by mouth.<br>
 The insoluble sulfate used in radiography is non-poisonous.<br>
 The usual result of exposure to the sulfide, oxide and carbonate is irritation of the eyes, nose and throat and of the skin.<br>
 
<a name="4.3H">4.3</a> Boron toxicity<br>
Boron itself is not highly toxic, but accidental poisonings have been reported, from boric acid (boracic acid), oral ingestion of borates, 
and absorption of boric acid from wounds and burns.<br>
 
<a name="4.4H">4.4</a> Calcium toxicity<br>
 Compounds of calcium should be considered toxic only when they contain a toxic component.<br>
 Calcium oxide and calcium hydroxide have caustic reactions and are therefore irritating to the skin and respiratory system.<br>
 
<a name="4.5H">4.5</a> Chromium toxicity<br>
 Chromic acid and its salts have a highly corrosive action on the skin and mucous membrane.<br>
 Chromate salts are recognized carcinogens.<br>
 The red, orange and yellow pigments of chromium contain the highly toxic carcinogenic Cr (VI), and are not permitted in schools.<br>
 The green pigments of chromium contain the less toxic Cr (III), e.g. lead chromate (yellow 34), chromium (III) oxide (green 17).<br>
 
<a name="4.6H">4.6</a> Cobalt toxicity<br>
 The toxicity of cobalt itself and most cobalt salts is low.<br>
 The toxicity of the compound will depend upon the anion with which  cobalt is combined.<br>
 
<a name="4.7H">4.7</a> Copper toxicity<br>
 The salts copper chloride and copper (II) sulfate have been reported  as causing irritation of the skin and conjunctivas.<br>
 Copper oxide is irritating to the eyes and upper respiratory tract.<br>
 The ingestion of large amounts of copper (II) sulfate can have fatal effects.<br>
 
<a name="4.8H">4.8</a> Lead toxicity<br>
 Cases of lead poisoning may occur:<br>
 1. by inhalation of dusts, fumes, mists or vapours,<br>
 2. by ingestion of lead compounds introduced into the mouth on food, tobacco, fingers, and through the skin, particularly if organic lead compounds.<br>
 Lead is a cumulative poison.<br>
 Increasing amounts build up in the body and eventually a point is 
reached where symptoms and disability occur.<br>
 Of the various compounds, the carbonate, the monoxide and the sulfate are considered to be more toxic than metallic lead or other lead compounds.<br>
 
<a name="4.9H">4.9</a> Magnesium toxicity<br>
 Poisoning can result from prolonged exposure to fumes or dusts.<br>
 
<a name="4.10H">4.10</a> Mercury toxicity<br>
<b> DO NOT USE MERCURY IN SCHOOL SCIENCE EXPERIMENTS</b><br>
<b> DO NOT STORE MERCURY IN THE SCHOOL LABORATORY</b><br>
 1. A number of mercury compounds can cause skin irritation and can be absorbed through the skin, leading to mercury poisoning.<br>
 Mercury compounds and the metal itself may enter the body as vapours of fumes or dusts.<br>
 Some can cause kidney damage while others can cause irreversible damage to the central nervous system.<br>
 Mercuric compounds are generally more toxic than mercurous compounds.<br>
 Give any mercury stored in the school laboratory to a government laboratory.<br>
2. Mercury vapour is toxic and may damage the nervous system.<br>
 Mercury enters the body by inhalation, ingestion or through the skin.<br>
 Mercury vaporizes at the temperature at which water freezes.<br>
 The vapour is odourless, tasteless, and colourless.<br>
 Chronic exposure may result in cumulative poisoning with nervous and psychic symptoms.<br>
3. Students may observe mercury in a mercury glass thermometer.<br>
However, the teacher must keep hold of the thermometer and not leave it on the bench where it may roll off and break on the floor.<br>
 If mercury spills from a broken thermometer, immediately remove the students from the room and open the windows.<br>
 Close doors opening into corridors.<br>
 Pick up all the mercury with a damp cloth or a water suction pump.<br>
 Sprinkle zinc powder or sulfur powder or agricultural spray that contains sulfur over the area of the spillage.<br>
 These substances react with mercury to form an inert material that does not vaporize.<br>
 Collect the mercury and zinc or sulfur with a wet cloth or use a
dustpan and broom to gather the mercury into one small mass.<br>
 Put the mercury in a plastic container that can be sealed tightly.<br>
 Give the mercury recovered to a government laboratory.<br>
 Contamination by many small globules left in cracks and crevices is possible after most mercury has been removed.<br>
 Keep zinc dust or powdered sulfur handy in the laboratory.<br>
 Report any mercury spillage to the principal who may ask health authorities for advice on any further safety action.<br>
4. Mercury is toxic when inhaled or taken internally or absorbed through the skin.<br>
 Most mercury compounds are highly toxic if ingested or absorbed through  the skin.<br>
 Mercury vapour is highly toxic when inhaled and is a cumulative poison.<br>
 The nervous system is very sensitive to all forms of mercury.<br>
 Exposure to high levels of any types of mercury can permanently damage  the brain, kidneys, and developing foetus.<br>
 Mercury also accumulates in the body.<br>
 Both mercury and its compounds have high acute (short-term) and have high chronic (long-term) toxicity on aquatic life.<br>
 Eating fish contaminated with mercury has caused poisoning in humans, birds and land animals exposed in the same manner could also be poisonous.<br>
 There is not sufficient data to determine the acute toxicity of mercury and its compounds on plants, birds or land animals.<br>
 Mercury and its compounds are highly persistent in water and the environment and will bioaccumulate or concentrate in the tissues of fish.<br>
 These concentrations will be considerably higher than the water from which the fish is taken.<br>
 Mercury emitted to the environment will remain for years.<br>
 In areas of mercury contamination, larger and older fish tend to have higher levels of mercury if they eat local smaller fish.<br>
 
<a name="4.11H">4.11</a> Nickel toxicity<br>
 Although nickel and most salts of nickel are generally not considered  toxic, nickel (II) compounds are carcinogenic.<br>
 
<a name="4.12H">4.12</a> Potassium toxicity<br>
 Toxicity of the compounds is variable.<br>
 The potassium ion is practically non-toxic, hence the toxicity of potassium compounds would depend upon the anion involved.<br>
 
<a name="4.13H">4.13</a> Silver toxicity<br>
 The silver ion is intensely corrosive to tissue.<br>
 
<a name="4.14H">4.14</a> Sodium toxicity<br>
 Toxicity of sodium varies with the compound.<br>
 The sodium ion is considered non-toxic.<br>
 The toxicity of sodium compounds is frequently, though not always, because of the anion involved.<br>
 
<a name="4.15H">4.15</a> Strontium toxicity<br>
 The strontium ion has a low order of toxicity.<br>
 It is chemically and biologically similar to calcium.<br>
 The toxicity of the compounds is considered to be dependent upon the anion involved.<br>
 
<a name="4.16H">4.16</a> Zinc toxicity<br>
 Although zinc is not inherently a toxic element, small doses of soluble  zinc salts cause nausea and vomiting.<br>
 Larger doses cause violent vomiting and purging.<br>
 Zinc chloride. because of its caustic action, can produce skin ulcers.<br>

<a name="5.1H">5.1</a> Acute toxicity<br>
Acute toxicity, from "Health hazards" (Draft Australian criteria for the classification of hazardous chemicals)<br>
Acute toxicity refers to those adverse effects occurring following oral or dermal administration of a single dose of a substance or a mixture, or multiple doses given within 24 hours, or an inhalation exposure of 4 hours.<br>
 
<a name="5.2H">5.2</a> Serious eye damage / eye irritation<br>
 Serious eye damage / eye irritation, from "Health hazards" (Draft Australian criteria for the classification of hazardous chemicals)<br>

<a name="5.3H">5.3</a> Respiratory sensitization  or skin sensitization<br>
 Respiratory sensitization / skin sensitization, from "Health hazards"  (Draft Australian criteria for the classification of hazardous chemicals)<br>
 Respiratory sensitizer means a substance that will lead to hypersensitivity  of the airways, following inhalation of the substance.<br>
 Skin sensitizer means a substance that will lead to an allergic response  following skin contact.<br>
 
<a name="5.4H">5.4</a> Germ cell mutagenicity<br>
Germ cell mutagenicity, from "Health hazards" (Draft Australian criteria for the classification of hazardous chemicals)<br>
A mutation means a permanent change in the amount or structure of the genetic material in a cell.<br>
The term "mutation" applies both to heritable genetic changes that may be manifested at the phenotypic level and to the underlying DNA modifications, when known, (including specific base pair changes and chromosomal translocations).<br>
The term "mutagenic" and "mutagen" will be used for agents giving rise to an increased occurrence of mutations in populations of cells and / or organisms.<br>
 
<a name="5.5H">5.5</a> Reproductive toxicity<br>
 Reproductive toxicity, from "Health hazards" (Draft Australian criteria  for the classification of hazardous chemicals)<br>
 Reproductive toxicity includes adverse effects on sexual function and fertility in adult males and females.<br>
 
<a name="5.6H">5.6</a> Specific target organ toxicity<br>
Specific target organ toxicity, single exposure, from "Health hazards"  (Draft Australian criteria for classification of hazardous chemicals)<br>
 5.7a Specific target organ toxicity, repeated exposure from "Health  hazards".<br>
 
<a name="5.7H">5.7</a> Aspiration hazard<br>
Aspiration hazard, from "Health hazards" (Draft Australian criteria for the classification of hazardous chemicals)<br>
Aspiration is the entry of a liquid or solid substance or mixture directly through the oral or nasal cavity, or indirectly from vomiting, into the trachea and lower respiratory system.<br>
Aspiration toxicity includes severe acute effects such as chemical pneumonia, varying degrees of pulmonary injury or death following aspiration.<br>

<a name="15.4.0H">15.4.0</a> Dust explosions<br>
 Dusts have a huge surface / volume ratio so have a huge potential for explosive chemical reactions.<br>
 The conditions necessary for a dust explosion to occur are combustible dust, confinement of dust by walls, dispersion of dust into a cloud above a certain concentration, oxidant present, e.g. air.<br>
 The ignition temperatures of dust explosion may be comparatively low, e.g. sugar dust at density 60 g / m3 ha ignition temperature 370 oC.<br>
 The ignition of <i>Lycopodium</i> powder, icing sugar, dusting sugar, vanilla bean dusting sugar, or any other powders or dusts in sealed coffee tins is not recommended in school science laboratories.<br>

 1. The advice from emergency authorities nowadays is that as soon as a car hits the water and starts to sink, do the following:<br>
 Immediately undo the  seat belts, wind down the windows and exit through the opened windows.<br>
 The front side windows may be larger than the hind windows.<br>
 Do not waste time by calling 999 first.<br>
 If children are in the back of the car, get the largest child out first, then the smaller child or children, then yourself.<br>
 2. If the car submerges before you can get out,  the door of a submerged car cannot be opened until the interior is flooded, 
 The  pressure differential between outside and inside is too great for a trapped person to force open the door.<br>
 The inside and outside pressures must be equalized, so the interior must be flooded first.<br>
 A trapped person should try to remain calm and not attempt to open the door until the interior is almost flooded.<br>
 A trapped person can open a window in a submerged car only by using a window breaking hammer, which has a pointed tip to shatter tempered glass.<br>
 These hammers are cheap, costing only about $10.<br>
