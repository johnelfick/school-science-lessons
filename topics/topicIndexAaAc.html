<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.3.0H">12.3.0H</a> Properties of acids<br>
 Acids are good electrolytes, react with active metals, turn blue litmus red, and have a sour taste.<br>
 Dilute acids contain hydrogen ions in aqueous solution.<br>
 Represent the hydrogen ion, a proton, in different ways to show how it is related to the water molecules in the solution.<br>
 Show it as the hydrated hydrogen ion, [proton, H+(aq)], or as the hydronium ion [oxonium ion, H3O+(aq)]<br>
 However, for convenience, use H+(aq).<br>
 Concentrated sulfuric acid exists mainly as H2SO4 molecules.<br>
 Hydrochloric acid and nitric acid dissociate into ions even in concentrated solution.<br>
 Weak acids, e.g. ethanoic acid, acetic acid, CH3COOH carbonic acid and sulfurous acid dissociate very little in aqueous solution.<br>
 However, their salts, e.g. potassium acetate CH3COOK, are completely dissociated into ions.<br>
 Use the Bronsted-Lowry definition of acids and bases:<br>
An acid donates a proton (H+) to another substance and a base accepts a proton from another substance.<br>
 When sulfuric acid dissociates in water it donates a proton (H+) to the water molecule.<br>
 In this reaction the water molecule acts as a base.<br>
 H2SO4 + H2O --> HSO4-+ H3O+<br>
When ammonia dissolves in water, ammonia accepts a proton and so it is the base.<br>
 So in this reaction the water molecule acts as an acid<br>
 NH3 + H2O &lt; --> NH4++ OH-<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.3.1H">12.3.1</a> Amphoteric substances<br>
Amphoteric substances can act as an acid or a base.<br>
 In the above reactions water is acting as a base with sulfuric acid and is acting as an acid with ammonia.<br>
 Similarly, bicarbonate ion can act as an acid to donate a proton to form the carbonate ion.<br>
 HCO3-+ H2O &lt; --> CO32-+ H3O+<br>
Also, bicarbonate ion can act as a base to accept a proton to form carbonic acid.<br>
 HCO3-+ H2O &lt; --> H2CO3 + OH-<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.3.2H">12.3.2</a> Polyprotic acids<br>
 Polyprotic acids can donate more than one proton, e.g. carbonic acid.<br>

 HCO3<strike>-</strike>+ H2O &lt; --> CO32-+ H3O+ (The second proton to be donated to a water molecule.)<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.3.3H">12.3.3</a> Strong acids and weak acids<br>
 A strong acid completely dissociates into ions, e.g. nitric acid has almost complete dissociation, 93%.<br>
 HNO3 (aq) + H2O H3O+(aq) + NO3-(aq)<br>
 A weak acid only partly dissociates into ions, e.g. acetic acid.<br>
 CH3COOH + H2O &lt; --> CH3COO-+ H3O+<br>
Describing acids and bases as "strong" or "weak"only refers to their reaction with water.<br>
It does not refer to the concentration or the number of moles in a volume.<br>
The strong acids include:<br>
Perchloric acid HClO4, hydrochloric acid HCl, hydrobromic acid HBr, hydroiodic acid (hydriodic acid), HI, nitric acid HNO3, and sulfuric acid H2SO4.<br>
Any other acid is a weak acid, because it does not completely dissociate in water.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.3.4H">12.3.4</a> pH<br>
Water can transfer a proton from one molecule to another, autionization.<br>
 2H2O <--> H3O++ OH-and H2O &lt; --> H++ OH-<br>
 The product of hydrogen ion concentration, [H+] and hydroxide ion concentration, [OH-] = the constant, Kw<br>
 Kw = [H+] × [OH-] = 1.00 × 10-14<br>
So [H+] = 10-7and [OH-] = 10-7<br>
The hydrogen ion concentration is very small in pure water, so the concentration is describes in terms of its negative log.<br>
pH is the negative log of the hydrogen ion concentration, pH = -log[H+], so hydrogen ion concentration, [H+] = 10-pH.<br>
So acidic solutions have a high [H+] and low pH values.<br>
Basic solutions have low [H+] and high pH values.<br>
A solution that is neither acidic nor basic, a neutral solution, has [H+] = [OH-], so pH = 7.<br>
A more acid solution has pH approaching 1.<br>
A more basic solution has pH approaching 14.<br>

1. The acid dissociation constant, Ka, measures the strength of an acid in solution.<br>
2. An acid, HA, dissociates into A-, conjugate base, and H+, hydrogen ion (proton).<br>
The equilibrium equation when concentrations do not change is, HA &lt; --> A-+ H+.<br>
3. Dissociation refers to the break up of a molecule into smaller molecules, atoms or ions.<br>
In a buffer solution of the salt of a weak acid with a weak acid, the dissociation of the weak acid is negligible<br>
However, a salt may be dissociated completely into ions.<br>
4. The dissociation constant, Ka is the equilibrium constant of a reversible dissociation including the ionization reactions of acids and bases in water.<br>
The dissociation constant Ka = [A-] [ H+] / [HA] in mol / litre.<br>
5. However, dissociation is usually expressed as a logarithmic constant, pKa, where pKa = -log10 (1/Ka).<br>
It is the quotient of the equilibrium concentrations, in mol/L for ionization reactions at 25 oC.<br>
For pKa, the larger the value the weaker the acid, so strong acids have pKa &lt; 2, and weak acids have pKa &gt;2, &lt; 12.<br>
6. Confusion happens, because both Ka and pKa are sometimes both called "acid dissociation constant"!<br>

 Ka is a measure of the degree to which an acid or base will dissociate in water.<br>

1. Aluminium, Al (Latin <i>alumen</i> bitter salt, referring to alum), (US Aluminum), Aluminium ion, Al3+<br>
In 1990, The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) confirmed the use of the spelling "aluminium".<br>
However, people in the US are accustomed to using the spelling "aluminum".<br>
Aluminium is a silver, light, ductile, malleable, metal, with mechanical strength.<br>
Aluminium compounds are abundant.<br>
Aluminium is extracted by electrolysis from the main aluminium ore bauxite dissolved in cryolite.<br>
Bauxite is 8% of the earth's crust so aluminium is the most abundant element in the Earth's crust.<br>
Atomic number: 13, Relative atomic mass: 26.9815, r.d. 2.70, m.p. = 660 oC, b.p. = 2470 oC, E 173<br>
Specific heat capacity: 900 J kg-1 K-1<br>
Aluminium availability:<br>

Aluminium uses<br>
Aluminium metal is not tarnished in air, because it forms protective oxide that prevents further oxidation.<br>
The aluminium foil used in home kitchens from grocery stores and the aluminium wire and aluminium sheeting from hardware stores are all pure aluminium.<br>
Most reactions of aluminium are inhibited by a surface coating of aluminium oxide.<br>
This is the reason that such an active metal as aluminium can be used widely for construction and for containers.<br>
Alfoil disposable containers + lid, 105 mm width × 184 mm depth × 38 mm height.<br>
Aluminium foil is used to clean pots and barbecue grill on picnics.<br>
Rub rust from and polish chromium plating, seal used paint tins and planting pots, catch baking drips.<br>
Aluminium is protected by layer of oxide that can be thickened if an anode in electrolytic cell, i.e. anodized then can be coloured.<br>
It is malleable, low density, is used in "Alfoil" cooking foil, drink-cans, saucepans, duralumin (alloy of Al + Cu, Mg), aircraft bodies and struts, motor vehicle parts.<br>
Aluminium food additive, E173 (colour: metallic) (Banned, some countries, excess unsafe)<br>
Heated powder forms oxide.<br>
Excess aluminium may cause short term toxicity, e.g. aluminium sulfate in drinking water, corroded cooking utensils with acidic foods, alum treatment of water.<br>

Anti-bumping granules, boiling chips (- ceramic, silicon carbide, fused alumina)<br>
Boiling chips, fused alumina or flower pot bits, prevent large bubbles of gas forming that could cause explosive emissions from a beaker containing heated solution.<br>
Sudden formation of a large amount of vapour from the bottom of a heated vessel of liquid, rather than the usual controlled boiling causes explosions.<br>
So boiling chips (anti-bumping granules) are added to chemical reactions to keep the bubbles small and aid steady boiling.<br>
Hydrocarbons with longer chains have higher boiling points than with branched chains, because of more van der Waals intermolecular bonds between molecules.<br>

Large quantities of alumina, aluminium (III) oxide, are used in the cracking processes in oil refineries.<br>
One of the products, ethylene gas, C2H2, is used in the petrochemical industry to produce polyethylene and other polymers.<br>
Activate alumina is very porous and is used as a filter for water treatment, an adsorption desiccant and a catalyst for natural gas and oil refining processes.<br>
Experiment<br>
Use a fume hood for this experiment.<br>
Hot paraffin oil and ethylene gas are flammable.<br>
Set up the apparatus as in diagram 12.1.10.<br>

Put 5 cm of paraffin oil and boiling chips in the boiling tube.<br>
Clamp it at a shallow angle, then put 0.5 g of alumina powder half way down the boiling tube, then replace the stopper.<br>
Hheat the alumina strongly with a Bunsen burner, then heat the alumina and paraffin oil alternately until the paraffin oil boils and its vapour passes over the alumina.<br>
Let the first few bubbles of gas escape under the fume hood, then collect two test-tubes of gas.<br>
Fix stoppers on the test-tubes.<br>
Immediately after collecting the two test-tubes of gas, turn off the Bunsen burner and remove the delivery tube and stopper from under the boiling tube.<br>

 Be careful! Demonstrate this reaction only to senior students.<br>
 Place &lt; 5 g of aluminium chloride in a beaker in a fume cupboard and add water drop-by-drop.<br>
 The material will hiss, crackle and release clouds of hydrogen chloride and fine particles.<br>
 Anhydrous aluminium chloride, AlCl3, reacts violently with water to form the hydrated salt by hydrolysis, and a solution of hydrochloric acid + HCl gas.<br>
 Formation of an acid solution is more like a non-metal than a metal, which reflects the position of aluminium to the right of magnesium in the periodic table.<br>
 Fine aerosol particles may also be generated.<br>
 Both the hydrogen chloride gas and the fine particles are extremely irritant to the lungs.<br>
 Aluminium chloride should only be used in a fume cupboard and only in small amounts.<br>
 Do not mix aluminium chloride with alkaline materials, e.g. sodium hydroxide, because a violent reaction may occur.<br>
 Aluminium chloride is exceedingly hygroscopic so keep it in a tightly-sealed plastic container.<br>

 2Al (s) + 2NaOH (aq) + 6H2O --> 2Na+ (aq) + 2Al(OH)4-+ 3H2 (g)<br>
 The aluminium reacts with water to form the amphoteric aluminium hydroxide, Al(OH)3, which later goes in solution to produce aluminates, (Al(OH)4)-.<br>
 2Al + 6H2O --> 2Al(OH)3 + 3H2<br>
 Al(OH)3 + NaOH --> Na+ + Al(OH)4-<br>
 Al2O3 + 2NaOH + 3H2O --> 2Na+ + 2Al(OH)4-<br>
It is sold as "drain cleaners", e.g. <i>Drano</i>, contains sodium hydroxide crystals and pieces of aluminium, which react when put in a wet clogged drain.<br>
The reaction is very hot as the sodium hydroxide reacts with fats to form soaps.<br>
The hydrogen evolved applies pressure to move the pieces of aluminium to whirl around and cut the blockage.<br>
3. Stand a clear glass bottle in a container of water.<br>
Do not use a plastic drink bottle!<br>
Add water to the bottle to 1/3 volume and add water to the container so the water levels in the bottle and container are the same.<br>
 Add a small measured amount of caustic soda to the bottle.<br>
 Pick up the bottle, dissolve the caustic soda by swirling the bottle, then replace the bottle in the container.<br>
 Roll a sheet of aluminium foil into a tube to fit through the mouth of the bottle.<br>
 Attach a balloon to the mouth of the bottle so that it fills with hydrogen gas.<br>
 Attach a balloon clip and let the balloon float up in the air.<br>
If the balloon does not float up in the air, because it is not full enough, wait until the bottle has cooled and repeat with more caustic soda and aluminium foil.<br>
If the balloon does not float up in the air and feels heavy, the reaction has been too vigorous so some water has condensed in the balloon.<br>
So wait until the bottle has cooled and repeat the experiment with>less caustic soda and aluminium foil.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="13.3.6H">13.3.6</a> Aluminium with sulfur<br>
 Mix dry aluminium powder with twice its volume of sulfur powder.<br>
 Put into a test-tube only enough to cover the bottom of the test-tube.<br>
 Be careful! Larger quantities may explode! Set up a safety screen.<br>
 Clamp the test-tube vertically and heat with a Bunsen burner.<br>
 Note the vigorous action where aluminium sulfide is synthesized.<br>
 Leave to cool, then add drops of water.<br>
 Hydrogen sulfide forms, because of the hydrolysis of the aluminium sulfide.<br>
 2Al + 3S --> Al2S3<br>
 Al2S3+ 6 H2O --> 2Al(OH)3 (s) + 3H2S (g)<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="13.3.7H">13.3.7</a> Bauxite digestion<br>
 Wear safety gloves and safety spectacles.<br>
 Weigh 10 g of ground, dried bauxite and transfer to a reflux flask.<br>
 Add 100 mL of 20% sodium hydroxide solution and boil under reflux for 1-2 hours.<br>
 Leave to cool, then transfer the solution and residue to a 200 mL volumetric flask.<br>
 To make sure all the contents of the reflux are transferred, use demineralized water.<br>
 Leave to cool, then make up to volume with demineralized water.<br>
 When the muddy residue has settled overnight, remove a 10 mL aliquot to a 250 mL beaker and dilute to 100 mL with demineralized water.<br>
 Heat the mixture until it boils, then make acid with 1: 1 HCl using methyl red indicator.<br>
 Add 2 g of ammonium chloride, then add 1: 1 ammonium hydroxide until the yellow end point is reached.<br>
 Boil the mixture to coagulate the precipitate, then filter it while still hot and wash the precipitate on the filter paper with hot water.<br>
 Leave the precipitate and filter paper overnight to dry to a slightly damp consistency.<br>
 Transfer the precipitate to a weighed crucible, e.g. porcelain, silica or platinum.<br>
 Dry the precipitate on the edge of a hot plate.<br>
 Do not allow any material to be lost by spitting.<br>
 Transfer the crucible and contents to a muffle furnace and ignite to a constant weight at 1, 0000 oC to 1, 200 oC.<br>
 Leave the crucible and contents to cool in a desiccator, then weigh them.<br>
 Calculate the percentage of alumina in the the bauxite: (weight of crucible and residue - weight of crucible) × 20 × 100 / weight of the sample.<br>
 If the "mud" is left with the solution it contributes to less than 1% of the total volume, an almost insignificant error.<br>
 The alumina content can also be determined volumetrically with EDTA.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="13.3.8H">13.3.8</a> Burn aluminium in oxygen<br>
Sprinkle aluminium powder onto a Bunsen burner flame or heat aluminium powder in a crucible, then lower it into a gas jar of oxygen.<br>
The aluminium burns brightly to form the white powder magnesium oxide.<br>
 4Al (s) + 3O2 (g) --> 2Al2O3 (s)<br>
 aluminium + oxygen --> aluminium oxide<br>
 Aluminium oxide is an amphoteric oxide that does not dissolve in water.<br>
 Stored aluminium is always coated with aluminium oxide, which protects it from most chemical reactions.<br>
 So aluminium can be used for many purposes where an unreacted metal is needed.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="13.3.9H">13.3.9</a> Corrosion of aluminium<br>
Put a piece of aluminium foil in water.<br>
Put a copper coin on the foil and leave it for some days.
A simple aluminium /copper cell forms and a small electric current can be detected with an ammeter.<br>
The aluminium foil has holes where the coin lies on it.<br>
The water appears cloudy, because of the fine particles of aluminium released during corrosion.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="13.3.10H">13.3.10</a> Heat aluminium foil<br>
 Heat aluminium foil to form aluminium oxide<br>
 Aluminium foil (al-foil, alu-foil, "Reynolds wrap'), has thickness usually &lt; 0.2 mm.<br>
 It is shiny on one side and matte on the other side, caused by the rolling process of manufacture.<br>
 Heat a piece of aluminium cooking foil or a "silver" milk bottle top.<br>
 Describe what happens to the aluminium foil.<br>
 You may not see any changes, because aluminium does not change colour when heated.<br>
 The melting point is 655 oC to 660 oC.<br>
 When white hot, it slowly forms a coating of aluminium oxide, alumina.<br>
 Do not heat aluminium powder.<br>
 If not pure, it may explode.<br>

 Use &lt; 5 g total material of iodine to react with aluminium powder in a fume cupboard.<br>
 However, be aware that a cloud of unreacted iodine vapour may be released.<br>
 Fine particles of aluminium react violently with iodine, especially after a drop of water has been added.<br>
 A large amount of unreacted iodine is liberated as purple vapour into the air.<br>
 This reaction should only be done with &lt; 5 g of materials and in a fume cupboard or outdoors.<br>
 Mix the ingredients in a small ceramic mortar and pestle.<br>
 All observers must wear eye protection.<br>

 1. Heat charcoal with fusion mixture, note heated metal appearance.<br>
 Aluminium produces a white residue.<br>
 Add drops of cobalt nitrate solution and heat again to form a blue mass, but this is also caused by fusible phosphates, arsenates, borates and silicates.<br>
2. Test aluminium<br>
Test aluminium after dipping it in concentrated hydrochloric acid then press it on absorbent paper to remove the layer of aluminium oxide.<br>
The voltage reading will start at a low value then increase as remaining aluminium oxide dissolves.<br>
Record the maximum value.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="13.4.0H">13.4.0</a> Aluminium powder</a><br>
Aluminium powder is not safe for school use, so it is not supplied as powder.<br>
So to avoid explosive reactions, do not grind aluminium metal to powder.<br>
Finely divided aluminium particles (powder or fine turnings) burn in air with an intense white flame if ignited.<br>
A significant amount of ultraviolet radiation is emitted, and the flame should not be watched with the naked eye.<br>
Unoxidized aluminium powder reacts vigorously with both concentrated acids or alkalis to yield hydrogen gas, which is explosive when mixed with air.<br>
The reaction may occur with such vigour that the aluminium particles and acid or alkali may be ejected from the container.<br>
Aluminium metal reacts violently with halogens (chlorine, bromine, iodine).<br>
The reaction of aluminium with liquid bromine is hazardous and should not be attempted.<br>
