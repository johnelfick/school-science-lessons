<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.3.0H">12.3.0H</a> Properties of acids<br>
 Acids are good electrolytes, react with active metals, turn blue litmus red, and have a sour taste.<br>
 Dilute acids contain hydrogen ions in aqueous solution.<br>
 You can represent the hydrogen ion, which is really a proton, in different ways to show how it is related to the water molecules in the solution.<br>
 You can show it as the hydrated hydrogen ion, [proton, H<sup>+</sup>(aq)], or as the hydronium ion [oxonium ion, H3O<sup>+</sup>(aq)]<br>
 However, for convenience, use H<sup>+</sup>(aq).<br>
 Concentrated sulfuric acid exists mainly as H2SO4 molecules.<br>
 Hydrochloric acid and nitric acid dissociate into ions even in concentrated solution.<br>
 Weak acids, e.g. ethanoic acid, acetic acid, CH3COOH carbonic acid and sulfurous acid dissociate very little in aqueous solution.<br>
 However, their salts, e.g. potassium acetate CH3COOK, are completely dissociated into ions.<br>
 Using the Bronsted-Lowry definition of acids and bases, an acid donates a proton (H+) to another substance and a base accepts a proton from another substance.<br>
 When sulfuric acid dissociates in water it donates a proton (H<sup>+</sup>) to the water molecule.<br>
 So in this reaction the water molecule acts as a base.<br>
 H2SO4 + H2O --> HSO4<sup>-</sup>+ H3O<sup>+</sup><br>
When ammonia dissolves in water, ammonia accepts a proton and so it is the base.<br>
 So in this reaction the water molecule acts as an acid<br>
 NH3 + H2O &lt; --> NH4<sup>+</sup>+ OH<sup>-</sup><br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.3.0.1H">12.3.0.1</a> Amphoteric substances can act as an acid or a base.<br>
 In the above reactions water is acting as a base with sulfuric acid and is acting as an acid with ammonia.<br>
 Similarly, bicarbonate ion can act as an acid to donate a proton to form the carbonate ion.<br>
 HCO3<sup>-</sup>+ H2O &lt; --> CO3<sup>2-</sup>+ H3O<sup>+</sup><br>
Also, bicarbonate ion can act as a base to accept a proton to form carbonic acid.<br>
 HCO3<sup>-</sup>+ H2O &lt; --> H2CO3 + OH<sup>-</sup><br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.3.0.2H">12.3.0.2</a> Polyprotic acids can donate more than one proton, e.g. carbonic acid.<br>

 HCO3<sup><strike>-</strike></sup>+ H2O &lt; --> CO3<sup>2-</sup>+ H3O<sup>+</sup> (The second proton to be donated to a water molecule.)<br>

Atebrine was generally replaced by chloroquine, C18H26ClN3, but Plasmodium falciparum has developed resistance to it.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.3.0.3H">12.3.0.3</a> Strong acids and weak acids<br>
 A strong acid completely dissociates into ions, e.g. nitric acid has almost complete dissociation, 93%.<br>
 HNO3 (aq) + H2O H3O<sup>+</sup>(aq) + NO3<sup>-</sup>(aq)<br>
 A weak acid only partly dissociates into ions, e.g. acetic acid.<br>
 CH3COOH + H2O &lt; --> CH3COO<sup>-</sup>+ H3O<sup>+</sup><br>
Describing acids and bases as strong or weak only refers to their reaction with water and not the concentration or the number of moles in a volume.<br>
The strong acids include:<br>
Perchloric acid HClO4, hydrochloric acid HCl, hydrobromic acid HBr, hydroiodic acid (hydriodic acid), HI, nitric acid HNO3, and sulfuric acid H2SO4.<br>
Any other acid is a weak acid, because it does not completely dissociate in water.<br>

Water can transfer a proton from one molecule to another, autionization.<br>

 The product of hydrogen ion concentration, [H<sup>+</sup>] and hydroxide ion concentration, [OH<sup>-</sup>] = the constant, Kw<br>
 Kw = [H<sup>+</sup>] × [OH<sup>-</sup>] = 1.00 × 10<sup>-14<br>
</sup>So [H<sup>+</sup>] = 10<sup>-7</sup>and [OH<sup>-</sup>] = 10<sup>-7</sup><br>
The hydrogen ion concentration is very small in pure water, so the concentration is describes in terms of its negative log.<br>
pH is the negative log of the hydrogen ion concentration, pH = -log[H<sup>+</sup>], so hydrogen ion concentration, [H<sup>+</sup>] = 10<sup>-pH</sup>.<br>
So acidic solutions have a high [H<sup>+</sup>] and low pH values.<br>
Basic solutions have low [H<sup>+</sup>] and high pH values.<br>
A solution that is neither acidic nor basic, a neutral solution, has [H<sup>+</sup>] = [OH<sup>-</sup>], so pH = 7.<br>

 Compare the results with the table of the reactivity series of some metals.<br>
 The order of activity of the metals used, from the most active to the least active is as follows:<br>
 Magnesium | aluminium | zinc | iron | lead and copper - no noticeable reactions.<br>
 When reaction did occur, the gas liberated was hydrogen gas.<br>

 The order of activity of the acids is that dilute hydrochloric and dilute sulfuric acids are about equal in activity, but that they are more reactive than acetic acid.<br>
 The order of activity of the metals with respect to acids is similar to that with respect to water.<br>
 Magnesium ribbon forms most rapid bubbles of hydrogen gas then zinc then iron.<br>
 Tin forms few bubbles of hydrogen gas.<br>
 Copper forms no bubbles of hydrogen gas.<br>

Residual mixtures contain solutions of salts, but writing equations is difficult, because more than one reaction can occur between Cu, Mg, Zn and nitric acid.<br>

Acid dissociation constant, acidity constant, acid-ionization constant<br>
1. The acid dissociation constant, Ka, measures the strength of an acid in solution.<br>
2. An acid, HA, dissociates into A<sup>-</sup>, conjugate base, and H<sup>+</sup>, hydrogen ion (proton).<br>
The equilibrium equation when concentrations do not change is, HA &lt; --> A<sup>-</sup>+ H<sup>+</sup>.<br>
3. Dissociation refers to the break up of a molecule into smaller molecules, atoms or ions.<br>
In a buffer solution of the salt of a weak acid with a weak acid, the dissociation of the weak acid is negligible, but a salt may be dissociated completely into ions.<br>
4. The dissociation constant, Ka is the equilibrium constant of a reversible dissociation including the ionization reactions of acids and bases in water.<br>
The dissociation constant Ka = [A<sup>-</sup>] [ H<sup>+</sup>] / [HA] in mol / litre.<br>
5. However, dissociation is usually expressed as a logarithmic constant, pKa, where pKa = -log10 (1/Ka).<br>
It is the quotient of the equilibrium concentrations, in mol/L for ionization reactions at 25<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
For pKa, the larger the value the weaker the acid, so strong acids have pKa &lt; 2, and weak acids have pKa &gt;2, &lt; 12.<br>
6. Confusion happens, because both Ka and pKa are sometimes both called "acid dissociation constant"!<br>
