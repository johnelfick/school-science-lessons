 Many solids are crystalline.<br>
 Their particles exist in an ordered arrangement.<br>
 Crystallization involves the formation of the pure solid from its solution.<br>
 Many crystals contain water of crystallization, e.g. copper (II) sulfate crystals, CuSO4.5H2O.<br>
 However, anhydrous copper (II) sulfate, CuSO4, contains no water of crystallization.<br>

<a href="../images/16.3.4.11chd.gif">See diagram 16.3.4.11</a>: Aspirin<br>
 Dissolve an aspirin tablet in methylated spirit.<br>
 BE CAREFUL! Filter if necessary.<br>
 Heat the solution.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.1.2H">3.1.2</a>, Prepare boric acid crystals<br>
 Use 5 g of boric acid crystals.<br>
 Pour some into 2 cm boiling water in a test-tube and leave to dissolve.<br>
 Continue adding crystals and heat to boiling until all crystals dissolved.<br>
 Leave to cool to see fine white crystals form.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.1.3H">3.1.3</a> Prepare candy with sucrose<br>
 1. Use the solubility of sucrose to make toffee candy.<br>
 Prepare toffee or candy by heating the sucrose solution with milk or butter until it boils.<br>
 Heat to 125 o C.<br>
 Pour it into paper cups and leave to cool.<br>
 Constant stirring and temperature control is essential.<br>
 The actors in movies who appear to fall through a sheet of "glass" without hurting, fall through a sheet of clear toffee called "sugar glass".<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.1.4H">3.1.4</a>, Prepare citric acid crystals<br>
Squeeze a lemon with the help of a lemon squeezer and transfer the juice to a beaker.<br>
Add an equal amount of water and boil the liquid gently over a gauze and tripod for quarter of an hour.<br>
Filter the liquid while still hot into an evaporating basin.<br>
The filtrate is a solution of citric acid.<br>
Evaporate the solution on the gauze and tripod until only one third of it remains.<br>
Then put it on one side to cool and crystallize.<br>
The crystals of citric acid obtained in this way are not very pure.<br>
They are usually coloured brown.<br>
To obtain purer crystals, dissolve the impure substance in water and boil the solution with powdered charcoal (preferably "decolorizing" charcoal), for ten minutes.<br>
Then filter the liquid and leave it in a hot place to evaporate and crystallize.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.1.5H">3.1.5</a> Prepare crystal blossoms<br>
 Soak pieces of charcoal, brick or unglazed porcelain in a saturated solution of sodium chloride.<br>
 Keep the pieces covered by adding more saturated sodium chloride solution over a period of two weeks.<br>
 At this point mix some Prussian blue dye or ink with the sodium chloride and add this to the pieces of charcoal.<br>
 Then leave to evaporate to dryness.<br>
 Blossoms of crystals will form.<br>
 A variety of colours may be produced by adding different dye compounds.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.1.6H">3.1.6</a> Prepare crystal clusters<br>
 1. Soak pieces of charcoal or brick or unglazed porcelain in a saturated solution of sodium chloride for two weeks.<br>
 Add ink or dyes then heat the solution to evaporate to dryness.<br>
 "Blossoms" of crystals form.<br>
 2. Prepare a saturated solution of potassium dichromate.<br>
 Immerse cardboard shapes, e.g. a crown, and let the solvent water evaporate.<br>
 Red crystals form on the shapes.<br>
 3. Tie a light weight to a piece of cotton thread and hang the thread in a saturated solution of sodium chloride.<br>
 Remove the thread and hang it up to dry.<br>
 Light the hanging thread with a match.<br>
 The thread burns, but the sodium chloride is left as an ash strong enough to support the light weight.<br>
 4. Grow crystal gardens.<br>
 Drop crystals of metallic salts in a jar of water.<br>
 Leave the jar undisturbed for weeks and note the growth of "trees" of crystals.<br>
 Use aluminium potassium sulfate Al2(SO4)3.K2 (SO4).24H2O, chromium (III) potassium sulfate (VI)-12-water, copper (II) sulfate-5-water and iron (II) sulfate-7-water.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.1.7H">3.1.7</a> Prepare crystal crowns<br>
<a href="../images/3.2.49ch.gif">See diagram 3.2.59</a>: Crystal crown.<br>
 Cut a crown from a piece of tin taken from a fruit can.<br>
 Fasten it with a piece of wire as shown in the diagram.<br>
 Wrap the crown with strips of cotton cloth.<br>
 Dip the whole crown into a solution of potassium dichromate and then leave to dry.<br>
Seed crystals will form on the cloth.<br>
 Prepare a saturated solution of potassium dichromate at 80 oC and immerse the crown for a day in this saturated solution.<br>
 Red crystals should form and make a beautiful display on the crown.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.1.8H">3.1.8</a> Prepare crystal gardens<br>

 Use aluminium potassium sulfate Al2(SO4)3.K2(SO4).24H2O, chromium (III) potassium sulfate (VI)-12-water, copper (II) sulfate-5-water and iron (II) sulfate-7-water.<br>
2. Add 2 cm of sodium silicate solution to a jar.<br>
 Add hot deionized water, while stirring, and to bring depth in the jar to 10 cm.<br>
 Keep stirring until all the sodium silicate is mixed with the water.<br>
 Leave the solution to stand in a place where it will not be disturbed.<br>
 Drop into separate places in the solution 2-3 crystals of cobalt nitrate, nickel nitrate, iron (III) nitrate, and magnesium nitrate.<br>
 Draw a map to show exactly where the crystals are place in the bottom of the solution.<br>
 Leave the solution overnight and the next day note the colours where the crystals were placed.<br>
 The colours are characteristic of the metal ions put into the sodium silicate solution.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.1.9H">3.1.9</a> Prepare crystal rope<br>
 Make a saturated solution of sucrose (cane sugar).<br>
 Tie a weight to a cotton thread and suspend it so that the weight and most of the thread are in the solution.<br>

 Teach the children to dissolve pure substances and make crystals.<br>
 Use alum, Epsom salts, common salt, sugar, small spoons, a cup.<br>
 There are two main ideas here: dissolving and crystals.<br>
 When substances are dissolved in water, you cannot see them.<br>
 However, if you dissolve alum, Epsom salts, common salt or sugar, you can prove that these substances are still in the water, because you can taste them.<br>
 If you boil away the water from the dissolved substances by heating or leaving it in the sun, then the dissolved substances reappear as crystals.<br>
 Crystals have a glassy look and a certain shape and colour.<br>
 However, the crystals of common salt or sugar you buy are mostly broken into small pieces.<br>
 Use common salt, potassium permanganate (Condy's crystals) urea, magnesium sulfate crystals), a container to boil water in, a flat dish, small spoons, a cup.<br>
 Be careful! Let the children taste sugar or table salt, but not other crystals!<br>
 1. Show some common salt.<br>
 Let them taste it.<br>
 It tastes salty.<br>
 Pour a few spoons of water into a cup.<br>
 Stir some salt into the water and show this to them.<br>
 Can you see the salt now? [No.]<br>
 Is the salt still there? [Let them taste the water. Yes, you can still taste the salt.]<br>
 Explain that the salt is dissolved in the water.<br>
 2. Add more salt to the water and keep stirring.<br>
 When you can dissolve no more salt in the water, pour the water into two tin lids.<br>
 Leave one lid in the sun.<br>
 Heat the other lid very slowly over a flame.<br>
 What happens? [Water boils off, then crystals appear.]<br>
 3. Let the children look at the crystals with a magnifying glass.<br>
 What did you see? [Shiny solids with flat sides, sharp corners, white colour.]<br>
 Explain that all crystals are shiny, have flat sides, shapes and colours.<br> 
 Each kind of crystal has a special shape.<br>
 Here is a sand (quartz) crystal. It has six sides.<br>
 4. Let the children make sugar crystals and observe them.<br>
 5. Look at the tin lid left in the sun.<br>
 Do salty crystals appear? [Yes]<br>
 Where does this happen naturally? [In rock pools near the sea.]<br> 

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.1.11H">3.1.11</a> Prepare crystals from a melt<br>
 1. Put crystals of naphthalene on a microscope slide.<br>
 Hold the slide over a flame until the crystals melt.<br>
 Put a coverslip over the liquid and leave to cool.<br>
 Watch the crystals grow using a magnifying glass or a microscope.<br>
 Note whether crystals will grow from several points simultaneously to make boundaries where they meet.<br>
 Draw the shape of the boundary between the forming crystals and the melt.<br>
 View the crystals through Polaroid sunglasses.<br>
 2. Repeat the experiment with stearic acid (octadecanoic acid).<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.1.12H">3.1.12</a> Prepare crystals from a mixture of salts<br>
 Dissolve sodium hydrogen sulfate, ammonium iron (II) sulfate, magnesium sulfate and cobalt (II) chloride.<br>

<a href="../images/3.2.49ch.gif">See diagram 3.2.49</a>: Crystal in supersaturated solution.<br>
Seed crystals are very important in the sugar industry.<br>
 Only experts know how to reduce the crushed sugar cane mixture to a syrup solution.<br>
They add about 100 g of seed crystals to produce tonnes of sugar crystals.<br>
1. Add sodium thiosulfate crystals, Na2S2O3.5H2O, to 2 cm of water in a test-tube.<br>
 Heat the test-tube and keep adding sodium thiosulfate crystals until no more dissolves.<br>
 This solution is now a supersaturated solution.<br>
 Let the test-tube cool and note whether crystals form.<br>
 If no crystals form, add one seed crystal to help crystallization.<br>
 Use a magnifying glass to note whether the crystals in the test-tube have the same shape and size as the crystals added to the water in the test-tube.<br>
2. Tie a cotton thread to a paper clip and suspend the paper clip in the solution.<br>
 Leave the solution in a warm place.<br>
 As water evaporates from the solution during the next few days, crystals form, first on the rough edges of the paper clip.<br>
 Repeat the experiment by gently heating dry crystals in a test-tube.<br>
 The crystals dissolve in their own water of hydration to form a saturated solution.<br>
 Add a seed crystal for recrystallization.<br>
 Repeat the experiment with the following crystals:<br>
aluminium potassium sulfate Al2(SO4)3.K2(SO4).24H2O,<br>

 Put a solution of salt crystals in an unglazed clay pot and leave it in the sun.<br>
 Salt crystals appear first in the middle of the dish.<br>
 Around them no crystals appear, but there is really a thin lay of salt is deposited.<br>
 Salt crystals appear on the raised outer edge of the dish when surface tension causes the salt solution to rise up the porous edge slightly.<br>
 Then thry evaporate, leaving a thick layer of salt crystals.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.1.15H">3.1.15</a> Prepare crystals with different shapes<br>
<a href="../images/3.2.47ch.gif">See diagram 3.2.47</a>: Different shapes of crystals.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.1.17H">3.1.17</a> Prepare invert sugar<br>
Invert sugar, C12H24O12, from sugar cane, when sugar is treated with dilute acid or with the invertase enzyme.<br>
It contains an equal amount of glucose and fructose.<br>
It is a safe substance that differentiates from sugar cane in the rotation of the polarized light, to the left (levorotatory).<br> 
Prepare invert sugar by heating sucrose + water + cream of tartar or citric acid. (fresh lemon juice), to boil for 20 minutes at 114 oC.<br>
Invert sugar is used in confectionery, sorbets and ice cream as a substitute for corn sugar to prevent crystallization and give a smooth mouth feel.<br>
Invert sugar is used as a hygroscopic humectant to keep products moist, to assist browning caramelization. (Maillard reaction), and to enhances aromas.<br>
 C12H22O11 + H2O --> C6H12O6 + C6H12O6<br>
 sucrose + water --> glucose + fructose<br>
 Invert sugar is 50% glucose + 50% fructose.<br>

 1. Prepare a saturated solution of potassium alum crystals [Al2(SO4)3.K2(SO4).24H2O] by leaving crystals to dissolve over hours in a warm place.<br>
 Stir the solution during this time so that it becomes saturated.<br>
 Pour off the warm saturated solution into a beaker.<br>
 When the saturated alum solution is cold, some original crystal should remain undissolved.<br>
 You can also add drops of sulfuric acid or sodium bisulfite solution to keep the solution clear.<br>
 Suspend a heavy object by cotton in the liquid.<br>
 Diamond-shaped alum crystals form on the cotton.<br>
 The crystals have 8 sides, but some "corners" may be missing.<br>
 Detach some well-shaped crystals from the cotton and leave them overnight in the saturated solution to grow.<br>
 Select the largest crystal, tie cotton around it and suspend the crystal in the saturated solution.<br>
 After some weeks, the selected crystal can grow too big for the beaker.<br>

 If you remove the funnel and blow it gently, the crystals float off into the air and glisten brightly as they slowly fall.<br>
 Instead of a funnel, use a glass plate over the jar.<br>
 In this experiment, the mothballs do not melt, but change straight into vapour that condenses again on the cooler part of the beaker and funnel.<br>
 This change is called sublimation.<br>
 It is similar to the sublimation of ammonium chloride.<br>
 On a hot summer day, mothballs can be made to sublime merely by leaving them in a beaker on a window sill where sunlight falls on the jar.<br>
 Starry crystals again form.<br>

 Salinity varies from 32-38 parts per thousand.<br>
 Seawater contains mainly ions of Na and Cl, also Ca, Mg and K, and dissolved gases, O2, N2 and CO2.<br>
 Heat seawater to just below boiling point.<br>
 When the liquid has decreased by one tenth of its volume, add more seawater and continue heating.<br>
 When the crystals begin to appear, stir with a glass rod.<br>
 Push back into the liquid the crystals that appear on the sides of the beaker.<br>
 The mixture becomes a paste.<br>
 Heat the paste gently and stir until all the water evaporates and white crystals of salt remain.<br>
 The salt contains mainly sodium chloride with magnesium chloride and other salts in small quantities.<br>
 Dry the sea salt and leave it exposed to the air.<br>
 The salt becomes damp again, because the magnesium chloride is deliquescent and attracts water from the atmosphere.<br>
 Also, the magnesium chloride gives sea salt a slightly bitter taste.<br>
 Compare the crystals from seawater with crystals from a packet of table salt.<br>
 A typical composition of seawater:<br>
| Sodium chloride 77.74% | Magnesium chloride 10.9% | Magnesium sulfate 4.7% | Calcium sulfate 3.6% | Potassium sulfate 2.5% | Calcium carbonate 0.34% |

 After some days crystals appear on the lowest part of the thread between the beakers.<br>
 The saturated solution has moved along the thread by capillarity until reaching the lowest point on the thread.<br>

 Sodium polyacrylate is used as a thickening agent, in urine test kits, in tampons for menstruation, and in baby disposable diapers (nappies).<br>
 (A fully-loaded diaper feels damp, but not wet, so it is still comfortable to baby, but may cause toxic shock syndrome if nappy is not changed daily).<br>
 Sodium polyacrylate is used as "water crystals" to store water in soils, e.g. "Aqua Crystals", and as "magic instant snow powder" 
Sodium polyacrylate is used as novelty and movie set decoration (super slurper), and as "ghost crystals", invisible in water, having the same refractive index.<br>
 Sodium polyacrylate can absorb 800 × its own weight of water.<br>

 For over 1000 years in the Northern hemisphere ink was made from a mixture of an iron salt, e.g. iron (II) sulfate and infusion of plant galls.<br>
 The galls are formed by plants in reaction to attack by gall wasps. e.g. Biorhiza, and Amphibolips.<br>
 The galls used were from the oak tree, (Quercus robur), apple gall, oak marble gall and other nut galls, e.g. Rhus, and Caesalpinia.<br>
 The galls contain tannic acid C76H52O46, (gallotannic acid).<br>
 The reaction of the iron salt with tannic acid produced a grey liquid that would turn purple-black with the addition of a gum, e.g. gum acacia, gum arabic.<br>
 Sometimes carbon was added to the ink.<br>
 The ink becomes darker and harder with exposure to the air as Fe2+ converted to Fe3+, so keep it in tightly-sealed bottles.<br>

 Crush or cut up one or two galls and boil the pieces with water in a beaker or small pan.<br>
 The water extracts tannic acid from the oak galls.<br>
 Strain off or filter the solution of tannic acid.<br>
 Prepare a solution of iron (II) sulfate in cold water and mix it with an equal amount of the cold oak gall solution.<br>
 This forms iron (II) tannate in the liquid.<br>
 Write on paper with the liquid.<br>
 The writing shows little colour, but when left for a day or two turns black, because iron (II) tannate on exposure to air forms black iron (III) tannate, ferric tannate.<br>
 In commercial blue-black ink, it contains a blue dye in addition to the iron (II) tannate.<br>
 The dye acts as temporary colouring matter until the black colour of the iron (III) tannate develops.<br>
 Make blue-black ink by adding to the ink prepared as above a solution of log wood or methylene blue, two common dyes.<br>
 If methylene blue is used, however, the ink should be stored in a dark cupboard, because light makes the colour fade.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.3.5H">3.3.5</a> Prepare casein plastic from milk<br>
<a href="../images/3.100.jpg">See diagram 3.100</a>: Casein.<br>
 Casein is a phosphoprotein thermoplastic polymer that may be used to make insulators, buttons, handles, adhesives and artist's priming paint.<br>
 Casein is prepared from the reactions of skimmed milk with ethanoic acid (acetic acid).<br>
 If casein is left in formalin solution it hardens.<br>
 It can be moulded and made into buttons.<br>
Experiments<br>
 1. Separate some milk from the cream, and put 100 mL of this milk into a beaker.<br>
 Heat it to about 50 oC and add acetic acid or vinegar until casein ceases to separate out.<br>
 Remove the lump of casein and squeeze it with the fingers to free it from liquid.<br>
 Work it in the fingers until it becomes rubbery.<br>
 Casein is a protein polymer containing nitrogen atoms.<br>
 If left in formalin solution it hardens.<br>
 It can be moulded and made into buttons.<br>
2. Add 1 mL of glacial acetic acid to 10 mL of water.<br>
 Heat 200 mL of skimmed milk to 50 oC then maintain the temperature.<br>
 Do not let the solution boil.<br>
 Add drops of the acetic acid solution or vinegar to the warmed milk while stirring.<br>
 Leave to stand until the liquid becomes clear and white-yellow lumps of casein curd separates.<br>
 Remove the heat and leave to cool.<br>
 Use gloves to remove the lumps of casein, wash them under the tap, and squeeze them together until dry and the resulting one lump becomes rubbery.<br>
 Mould it into shapes and then expose it to the air for 2 days.<br>
 Leave the dried casein in 40% formaldehyde solution (formalin) to harden.<br>
 Polish the hard casein plastic with sandpaper.<br>
 Add ammonia solution to prepare glue.<br>
 Calcium caseinate + 2H+ --> casein + Ca2+.<br>
3. Use acid to make milk curdle.<br>
 Use skimmed milk or dried milk that has been reconverted to milk by mixing with hot water.<br>
 Leave fresh milk to stand and later pour off the top layer of cream.<br>
 Heat half a beaker of the milk, but stop heating before the beaker becomes too hot to hold in the hand.<br>
 Pour a test-tube of vinegar into the beaker while stirring the milk with a glass rod.<br>
 The milk curdles.<br>
 Remove the curd with a spoon onto a newspaper and squeeze out the moisture by folding and pressing the newspaper to leave a spongy mass left of casein.<br>
 Milk also curdles when it turns sour.<br>
 This reaction is caused by bacteria that change the milk sugar into lactic acid, C3H6O3, that precipitates the casein as a curd.<br>
 Pure lactic acid is a white crystalline substance.<br>
4. Heat milk until it is hot, but not boiling.<br>
 Pour the milk into the bowl.<br>
 Add the vinegar to the milk and stir it up with a spoon for about a minute.<br>
 Casein occurs when the protein in the milk reacts with the acid in the vinegar.<br>
 The casein in milk does not mix with the acid and so it forms blobs.<br>
 Pour the hot milk through the strainer into the sink to leave behind lumpy blobs in the strainer.<br>
 When cool enough, rinse the blobs water while you press them together.<br>
 Press the blobs into a shape and it will harden in a few days.<br>
5. Into one jam jar put 2 tablespoons of dried skimmed milk powder and mix with about 100 mL of water, about 60 oC.<br>
 Add 15 mL of vinegar and stir well.<br>
 The milk curdles as the vinegar is added to form solid curds and liquid whey.<br>
 After about three minutes the liquid and solid will begin to separate out.<br>
 Cover the top of the other jam jar with coffee filter paper and filter the milk / vinegar mixture by pouring the liquid into the filter.<br>
 Discard the liquid, but retain the solid residue on the coffee filter paper.<br>
 To make buttons, take a lump of residue, press into a thin layer and mould into a button shape with holes for sewing on with a needle and thread.<br>
 Put the button on a piece of aluminium foil and allow to dry overnight.<br>
 To make glue, scrape the residue into a clean container and add 1 tablespoon of warm water and half a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda.<br>
 Mix well for a couple of minutes until mixture is smooth.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.5.0H">4.5.0</a> Tests for plastics, flotation tests<br>
 1. Polyethylene, polypropylene, styrene- butadiene and some types of nitrile will float after wetting it thoroughly, pushing it below the surface of water then released.<br>
 You cannot test foam plastics in this test.<br>
 Wet test strips of the following plastics and then push them down below the surface of water + a drop of detergent in a beaker.<br>
 Some plastics contain additives that affect the density.<br>
 The Polyethene, PE strip floats in tap water, because its density is 0.9 g cm3.<br>
 Slowly add sodium chloride to the tap water so that it all dissolves.<br>
 As the density of the water increases the test pieces start to move up towards the surface of the water.<br>
 Note the order the test pieces move up.<br>
 The PE test strip moved up first so label it 1.<br>
Then label the others.<br>
 Test strips and order of moving up:<br>
 1. Polyethene, PE, polyethylene,<br>
 2. Polystyrene, PS,<br>
 3. Polymethyl methacrylate, PMMA,<br>
 4. Polyvinyl chloride, PVC,<br>
 5. Phenolic, PF<br>
 6. Polyester, UP<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">2. Test about 200 cm3 of following plastics in solutions of known density: PET, PVC, PS, HDPE, LDPE, PP EPS<br>
 For example, PS sample should float in solution 5.<br>
But it should sink in solution 1.<br>
