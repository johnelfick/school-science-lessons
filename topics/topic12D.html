<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.7.1H"></a>12.7.1 Bases, properties of bases, alkalis<br>
 A base can dissolve in water to form hydroxyl ions and react with acids to form salts.<br>
 The term "base" includes the alkalis basic oxides and basic hydroxides.<br>
 The strong bases are lithium hydroxide LiOH, sodium hydroxide NaOH, potassium hydroxide KOH, rubidium hydroxide RbOH, caesium hydroxide CsOH.<br>
 Most bases dissolve in water releasing hydroxide ions (OH<sup>-</sup>) and react with acids to form salts.<br>
 In the reaction with dilute sulfuric acid, the base copper (II) oxide the oxide accepts hydrogen ions.<br>
 So you can say that a base is a proton acceptor.<br>
 CuO (s) + H2SO4 (aq) --> CuSO4 (aq) + H2O (l)<br>
 O<sup>2+</sup> (g) + 2H<sup>+</sup> (aq) --> H2O (l)<br>
 NaOH (s) --> Na<sup>+</sup> (aq) + OH- (aq)<br>
 A basic oxide is a metal oxide, e.g. CuO.<br>
 A basic hydroxide is a metal hydroxide that is insoluble in water, e.g. Mg(OH)2.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Alkalis<br>
 (Arabic: <i>al-kalī</i>, calcined ashes)<br>
 An alkali is water-soluble base yielding a caustic solution, pH &gt; 7.<br>
 In the later eighteenth century, the word "alkali" referred to any potash needed for glass and soap manufacture.<br>
 The "alkali" needed for making soap was formerly produced by burning wood charcoal or dried seaweed.<br>
 Alkalis are bases that are easily soluble in water.<br>
 The most commonly used alkalis are sodium hydroxide (caustic soda) calcium hydroxide and dilute ammonia solution.<br>
 An alkali is a hydroxide that dissolves in water to form a solution with pH &gt; 7 and contains hydroxyl ions (OH<sup>-</sup>), e.g. NaOH.<br>
 Alkalis are good electrolytes, turn red litmus blue, and feel slippery.<br>
 Strong alkalis: ammonia solution, KOH, NaOH.<br>
 When strong alkalis dissolve in water, they completely ionize.<br>
 <b>Be careful!</b> Strong alkalis may burn the skin and cause blindness if splashed in the eyes!<br>
 Use safety glasses and nitrile chemical-resistant gloves.<br>
 NaOH (s) --> Na<sup>+ </sup>(aq) + OH<sup>- </sup>(aq)<br>
 Weak alkalis do not completely ionize in water, e.g. pass ammonia gas through water to form dilute ammonia solution.<br>
 NH4OH (aq) &lt;-- NH4<sup>+</sup> (aq) + OH<sup>-</sup> (aq)<br>
 or, using the more modern way of representing this reaction:<br>
 NH4OH (aq) &lt;-- NH3 (aq) + H2O (l)<br>
 This solution is shown as NH3 (aq) + H2O (l), because while "NH4<sup>+</sup>" ions and" OH<sup>-</sup>" ions can be detected, "NH4OH" cannot be detected.<br>
 Experiments<br>
 1. Add a little solid sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide and barium hydroxide separately to a little water in separate test-tubes.<br>
 Shake the test-tubes.<br>
 Which of the substances are soluble? Place your fingers around each test-tube to see if heat is being produced.<br>
 You will have noticed that the alkalis are not equally soluble; the order of decreasing solubility is sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, barium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide.<br>
2. Prepare sodium hydroxide solution, potassium hydroxide solution, calcium hydroxide solution and barium hydroxide solution.<br>
 Test each solution as follows:<br>
 2.1 Pour a small amount into a test-tube and place in it a piece of red and a piece of blue litmus paper.<br>
 2.2 Add a few drops of methyl orange solution.<br>
 2.3 Add a few drops of phenolphthalein solution.<br>
 Record what happens in each case.<br>
 The alkalis turn red litmus paper to blue, colourless phenolphthalein solution to red and methyl orange solution to yellow.<br>
 2.4 Add a little solid sodium carbonate.<br>
 Observe any changes in the solutions.<br>
 No gas forms when sodium carbonate is added to solutions of the alkalis so they do not behave like acids.<br>
 The white solids formed in the calcium hydroxide and barium hydroxide solutions are calcium carbonate and barium carbonate.<br>
 A solid formed, because of a chemical reaction in solution is called a precipitate.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.7.3H"></a>12.7.3 Feel of alkalis<br>
 1. Feel some soap.<br>
 It feels slippery, because it contains alkalis.<br>
 Prepare very dilute solutions of each sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide and barium hydroxide.<br>
 Moisten your finger tips with each solution and rub your fingers together.<br>
 What do you feel?<br>
2. Wet your finger with the sodium hydroxide solution, feel it between your fingers, then wash them afterwards.<br>
 Describe the feel.<br>
 The solution has a soapy feel.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.7.2H"></a>12.7.2 Solubility of alkalis<br>
 Add to the same amount of water in test-tubes solutions of: sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, barium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide.<br>
 The relative solubility is in that order.<br>
 Feel the heat of reaction.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.7.7H"></a>12.7.7 Alkalis with metals, sodium hydroxide<br>
 Most metals do not react with alkalis.<br>
 However, zinc or aluminium reacts with alkalis to form soluble zincate and hydrogen or soluble aluminate and hydrogen.<br>
 Strong alkalis should not be stored in aluminium or zinc containers.<br>
Experiments<br>
 1. Add 5 mL of concentrated sodium hydroxide solution to test-tubes containing: copper, iron, aluminium, zinc.<br>
 Heat gently if no reaction is observed.<br>
 Test any gas from the reaction.<br>
2. Add a small piece of aluminium foil to quarter of a test-tube of sodium hydroxide solution.<br>
 Heat until bubbles of a gas appear, but do not boil the solution.<br>
 Test the gas by first trapping it in the test-tube and holding the mouth of the test-tube to the flame.<br>
 The gas at the mouth of the test-tube explodes with a squeaky pop sound.<br>
 The gas formed is hydrogen gas.<br>
 Aluminium reacts with sodium hydroxide to form sodium aluminate and hydrogen gas.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.7.3.1H"></a>12.7.3.1 Recycle aluminium drink-cans as potassium aluminium sulfate, alum<br>
Waste material can be converted to new substances, but full recovery is seldom attained, because of incomplete reactions and loss of partially soluble materials.<br>
In this experiment, conversion of aluminium scrap metal to alum crystals requires large quantities of sulfuric acid and potassium hydroxide.<br>
Be careful! Use safety glasses and nitrile chemical-resistant gloves</font>.<br>
Experiment<br>
 1. Use 4 g of pieces of an aluminium drink-can cut into thin shavings.<br>
 Put 150 mL deionized water in a 400 mL beaker.<br>
 Slowly add 50 ML of 6 M potassium hydroxide solution.<br>
 Add the shavings, put the beaker on a tripod stand and mat inside a fume cupboard, fume hood.<br>
 Heat the mixture gently over a small flame for 30 minutes to dissolve most of the aluminium metal.<br>
 Adjust the flame to keep a controlled bubbling rate in the beaker.<br>
 Use a glass stirring rod to prevent the metal shavings floating on top of the froth.<br>
 <b>Be Careful!</b> Keep your face away from the caustic spray!<br>
 When most of the aluminium has dissolved, turn off the Bunsen burner and filter the hot mixture through a funnel and glass wool plug to remove suspended paint, varnish and unreacted aluminium pieces.<br>
 Collect the filtrate in a 400 mL, beaker.<br>
 Cool the filtered solution to room temperature.<br>
 Transfer the liquid to a 250 mL graduated cylinder to record the total volume of solution.<br>
 Pour one quarter of this total volume into separate 150 mL beakers.<br>
 With continuous stirring, acidify each portion of the solution by slowly pouring 20 mL, of 9 M sulfuric acid into the beaker.<br>
 <b>Be careful!</b> Considerable heat is produced!<br>
 If any lumps of aluminium hydroxide precipitate are present after adding the sulfuric acid, heat the mixture gently with stirring.<br>
 Remove the heat when the mixture becomes clear.<br>
 Cool the solution m an ice bath for about 20 minutes with frequent stirring.<br>
 Crystals of alum, KAl(SO4)2.12H2O, form in the beaker.<br>
 Set up a Buchner funnel with all the holes are covered.<br>
 Clamp the flask to a ring stand, and connect the flask to a water aspirator.<br>
 After the alum crystals have fully formed in the ice bath, turn on the aspirator and transfer the alum crystals from the beaker to the Buchner funnel.<br>
 Wash the beaker with 20 mL of 60% ethyl alcohol / water solution to transfer any crystals remaining in the beaker.<br>
 Add these washings to the Buchner funnel.<br>
 Run the aspirator for several minutes, allowing the crystals to become moderately dry.<br>
 Remove the filter paper and alum crystals from the Buchner funnel and put on a watch glass.<br>
 Divide the mass of alum crystals recovered by the original mass of aluminium present in the solution to show the mass of alum crystals obtained per gram of aluminium metal.<br>
 2. Theoretically, 17.5 g alum crystals can be obtained from 1.00 g of aluminium metal.<br>
 Calculate the percentage yield: = Actual mass alum recovered per g Aluminium / Theoretical mass alum recovered per g Aluminium<br>
 1. Dissolving the aluminium<br>
 2Al (s) + 2KOH (aq) + 6H2O (l) --> 2KAl(OH)4 (aq) + 3H2 (g)<br>
 2. Acidifying with sulfuric acid<br>
 2KAl(OH)4 (aq) + H2SO4 (aq) --> 2Al(OH)3 (s) + K2SO4 (aq) + 2H2O (l)<br>
 2Al(OH)3 (s) + 3H2SO4 (aq) --> Al2(SO4)3 (aq) + 6H2O (l)<br>
 3. Forming alum crystals<br>
 K<sup>+ </sup>(aq) + Al<sup>3+ </sup>(aq) + 2SO4<sup>2-</sup> (aq) + 12H2O (l) --> KAl(SO4)2.12H2O (s).<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.7.8H"></a>12.7.8 Alkalis with salts, hydroxide ions<br>
 Hydroxide ions (hydroxyl ions) form precipitates with most metal ions.<br>
 All metallic hydroxides are insoluble in water except sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and ammonia solution.<br>
 [Not "ammonium hydroxide, NH4OH".<br>
 Ammonia solution is shown as NH3 (aq), because "NH4<sup>+</sup>" ions and "OH<sup>-</sup>" ions can be detected, but "NH4OH" cannot be detected.]<br>
 Calcium hydroxide and barium hydroxides are only slightly soluble.<br>
 However, all substances dissolve in water to some extent so there is no sharp distinction between soluble and insoluble substances.<br>
Experiments<br>
 1. Add drops of 2 M sodium hydroxide solution to 2 M solutions: copper (II) sulfate, copper (II) chloride, copper (II) nitrate.<br>
 In each case, a blue precipitate results.<br>
 These solutions contain only the copper (II) ion in common so this ion is the cause of the blue precipitate.<br>
 Add drops of barium chloride solution to: sulfuric acid, sodium sulfate.<br>
 In each case the white precipitate is caused by the sulfate ion.<br>
 Ba<sup>2+</sup> + SO4<sup>2- </sup>--> BaSO4 (s).<br>
2. Prepare solutions of collection of salts in separate test-tubes, e.g. magnesium sulfate, copper (II) sulfate, iron sulfate, potassium nitrate, calcium chloride.<br>
 To each solution slowly add a small quantity of sodium hydroxide solution.<br>
 Note the colour of any precipitate formed and any other change you may observe.<br>
 copper (II) sulfate (aq) + sodium hydroxide (aq) --> sodium sulfate (aq) + copper hydroxide (s)<br>
 copper ions (aq) + hydroxide ions (aq) --> copper hydroxide (s).<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.7.6H"></a>12.7.6 Alkalis with basic oxides, copper oxide<br>
 Basic oxides do not react with alkalis.<br>
 Add a small quantity, about the size of a split pea of sodium hydroxide solutions to: copper (I) oxide, calcium oxide, magnesium oxide, iron oxide.<br>
 In each case there is no reaction.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.7.4H"></a>12.7.4 Alkalis with acidic oxides, carbon dioxide<br>
 Acidic oxides react with alkalis to form salt and water.<br>
 1. Pass carbon dioxide bubbles through sodium hydroxide solution in a test-tube.<br>
 Note the size of the bubbles.<br>
 If the bubbles decrease in size as they rise through the solution, carbon dioxide is being used in a chemical reaction.<br>
 Carbon dioxide combines with water to form carbonic acid, so a reaction of this acidic oxide with the alkali occurs.<br>
 NaOH (aq) + CO2 (g) --> Na2CO3 (aq) + H2O (l)<br>
 Add dilute hydrochloric acid.<br>
 Test gases that form from the reaction with: moist litmus paper, a lighted splint, limewater.<br>
 The production of carbon dioxide confirms that the reaction forms a carbonate.<br>
 HCl (aq) + Na2CO3 (aq) --> CO2 (g) + 2NaCl (aq) + H2O (l).<br>
2. Pass a slow stream of carbon dioxide bubbles into the bottom of a measuring cylinder containing sodium hydroxide solution.<br>
 Note any alteration in the size of the bubbles as they rise through the solution.<br>
 After five minutes stop the flow of carbon dioxide and add 5 mL dilute hydrochloric acid.<br>
 Test any gas liberated with a lighted splint, pieces of damp red and blue litmus paper, and limewater.<br>
 The gradual decrease in the size of the ascending carbon dioxide bubbles shows that a reaction involving carbon dioxide occurs.<br>
 Carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide combine with water to form acids so you expect a reaction of these acidic oxides with dilute solutions of alkalis to occur.<br>
 The production of carbon dioxide after adding hydrochloric acid to the solution in the measuring cylinder confirms this view, because no gas is produced when hydrochloric acid reacts with sodium hydroxide, 
the only substance other than water originally present in the cylinder.<br>
 2NaOH (aq) + CO2 (g) --> Na2CO3 (aq) + H2O (l)<br>
 sodium hydroxide (aq) + carbon dioxide (g) --> water (l) + sodium carbonate (aq).<br>
3. Pass carbon dioxide through barium hydroxide solution in a test-tube.<br>
 Filter off the precipitate.<br>
 Add dilute hydrochloric acid to the precipitate.<br>
 Identify the gas liberated.<br>
 The reaction forms barium carbonate.<br>
 Ba(OH)2 + CO2 (g) --> BaCO3 (s) + H2O (l)<br>
 BaCO3 (s) + 2HCl (aq) --> BaCl2 (aq) + CO2 (g).<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.7.5H"></a>12.7.5 Alkalis with amphoteric oxides and hydroxides<br>
 Oxides and hydroxides of Al, Pb, Sb, Sn, and Zn are amphoteric.<br>
 An amphoteric oxide or hydroxide will neutralize an acid to form a salt and water, and will neutralize a base to form a salt and water.<br>
 When amphoteric substances react with alkalis, they behave as acidic oxides.<br>
 When amphoteric substances react with acids, they behave as basic oxides.<br>
 Aluminium hydroxide, Al(OH)3 solution, is amphoteric: A.<br>
 As a base, aluminium hydroxide with acids forms aluminium salts, B.<br>
 As an acid, aluminium hydroxide with bases forms aluminates, [Al(OH)4(H2O)2]<sup>-</sup>.<br>
 Experiments<br>
 1. Add dilute sodium hydroxide solution to: aluminium oxide, zinc oxide, aluminium hydroxide, zinc hydroxide.<br>
 Heat gently.<br>
 Note any reactions.<br>
 ZnO (s) + 2NaOH (aq) --> Na2ZnO2 (aq) + H2O (l)<br>
 zinc oxide + sodium hydroxide --> sodium zincate + water<br>
 Al2O3 (s) + 2NaOH (aq) --> 2NaAlO2 (aq) + H2O (l)<br>
 aluminium oxide + sodium hydroxide --> sodium aluminate + water.<br>
2. Repeat the procedure, but using dilute sulfuric acid instead of dilute sodium hydroxide solution.<br>
 Al2O3 (s) + 3H2SO4 (aq) --> Al2(SO4)3 (aq) + 3H2O (l)<br>
 aluminium oxide + sulfuric acid --> aluminium sulfate + water.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.7.10H"></a>12.7.10 Sodium hydroxide with zinc sulfate solution<br>
 The addition of aqueous sodium hydroxide to a test-tube containing zinc 
 sulfate solution will result in the formation of zinc hydroxide, 
 white precipitate.<br>
 2NaOH (aq) + ZnSO4 (aq) --> Zn(OH)2 (s) + Na2SO4 (aq)<br>
 On addition of excess aqueous sodium hydroxide, the precipitate reacts
 with the sodium hydroxide to form a complex salt, sodium 
 zincate.<br>
 Zn(OH)2 (s) + 2NaOH (aq) --> Na2ZnO2 
 (aq) + 2H2O (l) (insoluble --> soluble)<br>
 zinc hydroxide + sodium hydroxide --> sodium zincate + water<br>
 The resulting zincate is soluble and so dissolves to give the colourless
 solution.<br>
<a name="DissolveH"></a>Dissolve<br>
 However, many secondary school chemistry teachers, chemistry textbooks, 
 and handbooks on qualitative analysis, would describe the above reaction of zinc hydroxide with excess sodium hydroxide as "a white precipitate forms that dissolves in excess sodium 
 hydroxide to give a colourless solution".<br>
 Students are taught that dissolving is a physical change as the solute
 can be recovered easily and that no new substances form.<br>
 Thus the use of the word "dissolve" in the above situation may give students 
 the notion that the disappearance of the precipitate is a 
 physical change, when, in fact, it is a chemical reaction that occurred.<br>
 The word "dissolve" has also been erroneously used to describe the following 
 phenomena:<br>
 1. The reactions of excess aqueous sodium hydroxide with aluminium hydroxide, 
 result in the formation of soluble sodium aluminate.<br>
 2. The reactions of aqueous ammonia with silver chloride, zinc hydroxide
 or copper (II) hydroxide results in the formation of soluble 
 complex amines.<br>
 3. The reactions of acids with metals, insoluble bases, carbonates and 
 sulfate (IV)<br>
 Chemists use the term "dissolve" loosely to mean the disappearance of 
 a solid in a liquid, but they are aware of what is happening, 
 i.e., whether a reaction occurred or whether it is just solvation.<br>
 However, secondary new substances form.<br>
 The use of the word "dissolve" above may give students the notion that 
 the disappearance of the precipitate is a physical change, when,

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.2.1H"></a>12.2.1 Soaps and synthetic detergents (syndets)<br>
 Saponification is the process where fats are broken up by sodium hydroxide 
 to form soaps and glycerol (glycerine, propane-1,2,3-triol).<br>
 Soaps are the alkaline salts of fatty acids.<br>
 Most soaps are a mixture of sodium stearate and sodium palmitate.<br>
 Palmitic acid C15H31.COOH) is found in vegetable
 oils.<br>
 Octadecanoic acid, stearic acid [CH3(CH2)16.COOH] 
 is found in mutton fat.<br>
 Cis octadec-9-enoic acid (oleic acid, red oil, C17H33.COOH, 
 cis-9-octadecanoic acid) occurs as glycerine ester of fats and oils and 
 oxidizes on exposure to air and turns rancid yellow colour.<br>
 Soft soaps are made from potassium salts and hard soaps are made from 
 sodium salts.<br>
 Metallic soaps are compounds of fatty acids with metal bases and used 
 for waterproofing.<br>
 Resin soaps are alkali salts of resins.<br>
 Soap is not soluble in salt water.<br>
 Soap dissolves in water to form sodium ions and stearate ions containing
 along chain of carbon atoms with a negatively charged group 
 at one end that attracts water molecules.<br>
 The other ends of the long carbon chains do not attract water molecule, s, but can mix with non-polar compounds, e.g. oils and grease, 
 and surround small oil droplets to be taken away in the wash.<br>
 Dirt particles suspended in the grease and oil are also washed away.<br>
 The small oil droplets become negatively charges, repel each other and 
 so remain suspended in the washing water.<br>
 Sodium stearate is a salt of a weak acid so it produces slightly alkaline
 solutions, harmful to certain fabrics, when dissolved in water.<br>
 R(C=O)O<sup>-</sup> Na<sup>+</sup> + H-OH &lt;--> R(C=O)-OH + Na<sup>+</sup>OH<sup>-</sup><br>
In acid solutions, sodium stearate forms insoluble stearic acid

 Soap is made by using a double displacement reaction of a strong base, e.g. sodium hydroxide, + many fats and oils.<br>
 Castile soap, seafarer's soap, is made from vegetable oil, usually olive 
 oil, but also coconut oil and other vegetable oils.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Experiments<br>
 1. Dip the tips of two fingers in &lt; 0.1 M dilute potassium hydroxide
 solution to feel the soap made.<br>
 Rinse hands thoroughly after this experiment.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">2. For this experiment, wear safety glasses and
 the area must be well-ventilated.<br>
 Dissolve 2 g of sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide in 25 mL of methylated 
 spirit in a small beaker.<br>
 Heat the solution on an electric hot plate or in a water bath.<br>
 Pour 10 mL of olive oil into an evaporating basin, add the sodium hydroxide 
 solution then stir with a glass rod.<br>
 Put the evaporating basin on a large beaker filled with hot water.<br>
 Leave the methylated spirit to evaporate until a soft semi-solid mixture of soap and glycerol remains.<br>
 Dissolve the mixture in 25 mL of hot water and pour it into a 50 mL beaker.<br>
 Add 5 g of sodium chloride and stir.<br>
 Add 2 mL ethanol and warm the mixture, not to boiling.<br>
 Leave the mixture to cool, then cool remove the top layer of soap and 
 test it by shaking with water.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">3. Be careful! Do not touch the solid sodium hydroxide
 or the solution, because both are caustic.<br>
 Use safety glasses and nitrile chemical-resistant gloves.<br>
 Use animal kidney fat from a butcher.<br>
 Boil this fat in water and the oil will separate on the surface.<br>
 When cold, the fat will solidify and it can be separated from the water.<br>
 Melt the fat again and strain through several layers of cloth.<br>
 Weigh this fat and then weigh out one third as much sodium hydroxide
pellets.<br>
 Heat the fat in an iron dish.<br>
 When it is molten, slowly add the sodium hydroxide solution with continuous
 stirring.<br>
 Heat with a small flame to avoid boiling over.<br>
 Allow the fat and the sodium hydroxide to boil for 30 minutes.<br>
 Stir the mixture frequently.<br>
 Weigh sodium chloride using twice the weight of the sodium hydroxide
pellets.<br>
 After the 30 minutes boiling, stir the sodium chloride into the mixture 
 and leave to cool.<br>
 The soap separates as a layer at the top.<br>
 Separate this soap from the liquid below, melt and pour into matchboxes 
 where it will solidify again as small bars of soap.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">4. This preparation can be done with beef fat, 
mutton fat, lard, or olive oil.<br>
 Put an basin of beef dripping (which must be free from salt) or olive 
 oil into a beaker with three times as much dilute sodium hydroxide 
 solution.<br>
 Add three or four small pieces of broken tile or flower-pot to ensure 
 steady boiling and to prevent the beaker from bumping.<br>
 Cover the beaker with a small watch glass and pour cold water into the 
 watch glass.<br>
 The purpose of the watch glass is to condense the steam produced in the 
 boiling and prevent the liquid from drying up.<br>
 Heat the beaker very gently at first, moving the flame.<br>
 When boiling begins, continue the heating with a flame, the tip of which 
 touches the tripod.<br>
 Keep the contents of the beaker boiling for half an hour.<br>
 Then turn out the flame and leave the beaker to cool in a container of 
 cold water.<br>
 When the beaker is quite cold skim off any fat, or pour off any oil, 
which remains on the surface of the liquid.<br>
 Add two teaspoons of salt to the beaker and dissolve the salt in the
liquid by stirring.<br>
 A white jelly-like precipitate separates out.<br>
 This is soap.<br>
 Run off the liquid from the beaker, keeping back the soap with a spoon.<br>
 Stir the soap in the beaker with two or three lots of cold water to free 
 it from alkali and salt, pouring away the liquid after each washing.<br>
 Test the soap by rubbing between the fingers.<br>
 Note the soapy feel.<br>
 Put a small piece of the soap into a test-tube with water and shake the 
 test-tube.<br>
 An abundant lather forms.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.2.12H">12.2.12</a> Tests for soap<br>
 1. Dissolve a small piece of house- hold soap in half a test-tube of
hot water.<br>
 Tests the solution with red litmus paper.<br>
 The paper should not change.<br>
 Add one or two drops of phenolphthalein solution.<br>
 The liquid turns pink.<br>
 A solution of good quality soap is a very weak alkali and, although it 
 affects phenolphthalein, it s usually too feeble to change litmus.<br>
 2. Dissolve a piece of soap the size of a pea in half a test-tube of
hot water.<br>
 Cool the test-tube and add 5 mL of salt.<br>
 When the test-tube is shaken the soap separates out as a white precipitate
 on top of the water, because it is insoluble in salt water.<br>
 This explains why it is very difficult to obtain a lather when you wash 
 the hands in sea-water with soap.<br>
 3. Add drops of limewater to a solution of soap and shake the test-tube.<br>

 1. Alkalis react with fats and cooking oils.<br>
 For this reason sodium hydroxide (caustic soda) is used to remove fats 
 and greasy deposits.<br>
 Add a very small piece of lard (pig fat) or olive oil to half a large 
 test-tube of sodium hydroxide solution.<br>
 Boil very for a few minutes, keeping the test-tube moving over the flame 
 so that the liquid does not spurt out.<br>
 Wear eye protection and protective clothing.<br>
 Pour the hot liquid into a clean test-tube, and add a quarter of a test-tube 
 of clear, saturated, sodium chloride solution.<br>
 Leave to cool.<br>
 A white precipitate of soap settles out from the liquid.<br>
 When this process is done on a large scale in a soap factory, the soap 
 is separated from the liquid and pressed into blocks.<br>

 To purify the soap, after separation pour off the sodium hydroxide solution, 
 add water to the soap mass and heat until it dissolves and 
 separate again with concentrated sodium hydroxide solution or common
salt, sodium chloride.<br>
 Melt the soap again in a water bath.<br>

A surfactant is a molecule attracted to the surface of water and capable 
 of changing the properties of the surface, generally by lowering 
 the surface tension to make a solution more wettable.<br>
 Surfactants, surface active agents, lower the surface tension of water 
 on an item and allow more entry into tiny clacks and holes.<br>
 Then other chemicals in the solution can react with the item.<br>

 i.e. RSO3<sup>-</sup>Na<sup>+</sup>, similar to soap, RCOO<sup>-</sup>Na<sup>+</sup><br>
 Surfactant molecule = hydrophobic, water insoluble chain of fatty acids 
 + hydrophilic, water soluble, charged end.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Anionic surfactants<br>
 Anionic surfactants have negative charge at the water-soluble end.<br>
 They are used in most domestic detergents and especially for washing
glass, e.g. sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate, 
 CH3(CH2)11C6H4SO2O<sup>-</sup>Na<sup>+</sup>.<br>
 Anionic surfactant molecules concentrate on the surface layers of water 
 to lower the surface tension and allow the water to wet 
 hydrophobic surfaces.<br>
 The long hydrocarbon tail is soluble in non-polar substances, e.g. oil 
 and the sulfonate group at the other end is soluble in water.<br>
 So the surfactant molecule can lie across the oil water interface.<br>
 The molecules aggregate into micelles with the hydrocarbon tails towards
 the centre leading to emulsification of oily dirt and its removal 
 from the fabric being washed.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Cationic surfactants<br>
 Cationic surfactants have positive charge at the water soluble end.<br>
 Used in mild antiseptic throat medicine, algicides, fabric softeners

 3. Non-ionic detergents have polyethylene oxide group in the molecule.<br>
 The non-ionic polar groups in the molecule, e.g. -C2H4-O-C2H4-OH, 
 form hydrogen bonds with water.<br>

 e.g. sulfonation of benzene.<br>
 LAS (linear alkylbenzene sulfonic acid, CH3(CH2)11C6H4SO3H, 
 dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid), is the most used synthetic surfactant, because of low cost, can be dried to a stable powder and has a straight
 chain so it is environmentally friendly when degraded after use.<br>
 LAS is an mixture of anionic surfactants with molecules having hydrophobic
 and a hydrophilic groups.<br>
 LAS is a mixtures of homologues of different alkyl chain lengths C10 
 to C14) and phenyl isomers, each containing a sulfonated 
 aromatic ring attached to a linear alkyl chain.<br>
 The starting material LAB (linear alkyl benzene) is produced by the alkylation 
 of benzene with n-paraffins with aluminium chloride 
 (AlCl3) catalyst.<br>
 LAS is produced by the sulfonation of LAB with sulfuric acid.<br>
 The LAS is then neutralized to a salt (sodium, ammonium, calcium, potassium, 
 and triethanolamine salts).<br>
 LAS is mainly used to produce household detergents, laundry powders, 
dishwashing liquids and emulsifiers for agricultural herbicides.<br>
 Other anionic surfactants are alpha olefin sulfonates (AOS) 
 and alkyl sulfates (AS), nonvolatile compounds produced by 
 sulfonation.<br>

 blue colour so that the dry sheets would appear whiter.<br>
 Cotton naturally ages to a yellow colour, which does not fully reflect 
 blue light from incident sunlight.<br>
 These chemicals convert invisible ultraviolet light to visible blue light 
 to give fabrics greater uniformity of reflectance and appear "whiter".<br>

 cushion the impact of blades in front loading washing machines and may 
 expand up to cause shot circuits.<br>
 Some detergents contain a "low suds" foaming agent, because people think 
 that a non-foaming detergent is not doing anything!<br>
 Some detergents include soap to act as a water softener and surface active 
 agent and also to rapidly collapse foam during the rinse 
 cycle after wash.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.6.3H"></a>12.6.3 Bleaches in
 washing powders<br>
 The enzyme catalase catalyses the oxidation of substrates by hydrogen 
 peroxide and, if no substrate, it breaks down any hydrogen 
 peroxide to water.<br>
 Sodium perborate in water releases the powerful oxidizing agent hydrogen 
 peroxide that removes most stains without harming textile 
 fibres or removing dyes.<br>
 However, sodium perborate is effective only at high temperatures and
the enzyme catalase in some stains may destroy sodium perborate 
 at low temperatures.<br>
 The boron in detergent runoff in sewers may be poisonous to citrus crops.<br>
 Bleach activators can bleach at lower temperatures, e.g. penta acetyl 
 glucose, tetra acetyl ethylene diamine (TAED), sodium 
 percarbonate, nonoyloxy benzene sulfonate (NOBS).<br>
 TAED activates "active oxygen" bleaching agents, e.g. sodium perborate, 
 sodium percarbonate, sodium perphosphate, sodium 
 persulfate, urea peroxide, to release hydrogen peroxide in the wash cycle 
 by reacting with hydrogen peroxide to release peracetic acid, 
 a fast-acting bleaching agent.<br>

 bowls, sink mats, shower curtains and dishes, sponges.<br>
 Use bleach bottles to make hot caps for seedlings on cold nights, megaphones, 
 scoops, buoys, funnels, bird feeders, and to store salt 
 and corrosive substances<br>
 Bleaching powder is a mixture of calcium chlorate, calcium chloride and
 calcium hydroxide as a white powder, used to bleach fabrics 
 and sterilize water<br>

 Do not prepare soap in containers made of aluminium, because aluminium 
 reacts with sodium hydroxide.<br>
 Use clean dripping from a butcher shop or boil hard animal fat (tallow)
 in water and remove the separated oil from the surface.<br>
 Clean the separated fat by strain heated fat through layers of cloth.<br>
 Weigh sodium hydroxide pellets equal to one third of the weight of fat.<br>
 Weigh sodium chloride equal to twice the weight of fat.<br>
 Melt the fat and slowly add sodium hydroxide solution with continuous 
 stirring.<br>
 Heat gently to avoid boiling over.<br>
 Boil for 30 minutes then add the sodium chloride while stirring.<br>
 This is called "salting out".<br>
 When the mixture cools soap separates as a floating layer, skim off the 
 soap, heat it again, and pour it into moulds, e.g. trays of 
 matchboxes.<br>
 The reaction is much quicker if the fat is already dissolved in methylated
 spirit before adding the sodium hydroxide.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.5.1H"></a>12.5.1 Hardness in water, 
 water hardness, soft water<br>
 1. All natural waters contain dissolved cations and anions.<br>
 Water dissolves many ions as it flows through minerals.<br>
 Although water hardness is defined as the quantity of cations with a
+2 or +3 charge, calcium ions and magnesium ions are the most 
 common of such ions in natural water.<br>
 The formation of solid calcium carbonate is an endothermic process.<br>
 Thus, when water containing both carbonate and calcium ions are heated, 
 calcium carbonate can precipitate out onto the walls of pipes, 
 boilers, and household items such as tea pots.<br>
 This can shorten the life-time of some of these items.<br>
 Hardness indicates the tendency of water to precipitate soap or form
scale on heated surfaces and is expressed as the sum of Ca and 
 Mg and usually reported in equivalents of Ca carbonate.<br>
 Fe, Al, Zn and Mn also can contribute to hardness and should be considered
 if present in unusual amounts.<br>
 Hardness in water is a nuisance, because it makes washing difficult and 
 causes a precipitate of "fur" in kettles and "scale" in boilers.<br>
 However, hard water is not dangerous to health.<br>
 Some water authorities add salts to the town water supply to prepare
it harder, because it is believed that this may precipitate some 
 harmful bacteria and other micro-organisms.<br>
 Also, hard water may supply calcium in the diet.<br>
 Natural spring water is often hard.<br>
 The salts of fatty acids are insoluble in water except the sodium and potassium salts.<br>
 When soap is added to water containing metal ions, other than sodium
and potassium, ions, insoluble soaps form so removing the fatty 
 acid ions from solution, but forming a floating scum on the water.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2">2. The five units of measure commonly used in water
 analysis work are as follows:<br>
 2.1 milligrams per litre (mg / l)<br>
 2.2 parts per million (ppm, 1 ppm = 1 mg per litre)<br>
 2.3 grains per US gallon (gpg)<br>
 2.4 equivalents per million (epm)<br>
 2.5 grains per imperial gallon (gpg imp).<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">3. In the USA, hard water contains dissolved hardness minerals above 1 GPG (grains per gallon).<br>
 USA levels of hardness:<br>
| soft water &lt; 1 grain per gallon | slightly hard =1 to 3.5 grains per gallon | moderately hard = 3.5 to 7 grains per gallon | hard (very hard) = 7 to 10.5 grains per gallon | extremely hard &gt; 10 grains per gallon |.<br>
 GPG (gpg) is a unit of weight, 1 / 7 000 of a pound, 1 gpg = 17.1 ppm 
 or 1 grain per gallon is equivalent to 17.1 mg / L.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">4. The hardness of water is a measure of the amount
 of minerals, primarily calcium and magnesium, it contains.<br>
 Water softening, which removes these minerals from the water, may be
desirable if large quantities of detergent are needed to produce 
 a lather when doing laundry, or scale is present on the interior of piping<br>
 or water tanks, laundry sinks or cooking utensils.<br>
 Water that contains more than 200 mg / l (200 ppm) as calcium carbonate 
 (12 grains per gallon) is considered to be hard and may 
 cause plumbing and laundry staining problems.<br>
 Three grains per gallon equals about 50 ppm.<br>
 Methods used to soften hard water for home use are zeolite softening and reverse osmosis.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">5. Hardness expressed in mg / l as CaCO3:<br>
 0 to 100 soft, 100 to 200 moderate, 200 to 300 hard, 300 to 500 very hard, 500 to 1 000 extremely hard.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">6. Zeolite softening, ion exchange, exchanges calcium
 and magnesium ions in the water for sodium ions in the zeolite grains.<br>
 When the exchange capacity of the zeolite is exhausted, it can be regenerated by passing a strong sodium chloride solution through it causing it to give up the calcium and magnesium ions and take up a new supply of sodium ions.<br>
 However, only calcium, magnesium and small amounts of iron will be removed 
 from the water so people on salt restricted diets or with 
 high blood pressure may not be able to drink it.<br>
 Reverse osmosis units remove water hardness through a straining action
 as hard water passes through a membrane that allows water 
 molecules and only trace levels of contaminants to pass through it.<br>
 Reverse osmosis units are slow and produce more waste water.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">7. Hardness should not be confused with salinity.<br>
 Water can be very soft with low levels of Ca and Mg, yet have a high
salinity value from dissolved Na salts.<br>
 Most ground waters have hardness values of less than 2000 mg / L.<br>
 Hardness range in mg / L: 0-60 soft, 61-120 moderately hard, 121-180
hard, &gt;180 very hard.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">8. Hard water containing calcium ions that form
 a scum in black tea caused by reactions with the polyphenolic flavonoids, e.g. <a href="../topics/topicIndexCaCh.html#CatechinH">Catechin</a> and epigallocatechin gallate.<br>
 However, by adding lemon juice to black tea, the neutral pH is reduced, 
 the calcium ions are removed by the formation of covalent 
 soluble sodium citrate and unionized forms of other flavonoids.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.5.13H"></a>12.5.13 Temporary hardness
 and permanent hardness<br>
 Temporary hardness occurs when calcium hydrogen carbonate or magnesium 
 hydrogen carbonate dissolves in water.<br>
 When water with temporary hardness is boiled, the hydrogen carbonates 
 decompose to form insoluble carbonates.<br>
 They precipitate from the solution to leave "soft" water that forms a 
 lather easily.<br>
 calcium hydrogen carbonate (aq) --> carbon dioxide + water (l) + calcium 
 carbonate (s)<br>
 Permanent hardness in water occurs when calcium sulfate or magnesium
sulfate dissolves in water.<br>
 Boiling water with permanent harness does not affect the hardness.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.5.5H"></a>12.5.5 Remove water hardness<br>

 Remove permanent or temporary hardness in water by adding sodium carbonate  crystals (washing soda) to precipitate the calcium ions  or magnesium ions as carbonates.<br>
 Other methods are used for removing metal ions:<br>
 1. Add calcium hydroxide.<br>
 2. Add sodium hexametaphosphate, NaPO3(Na2O), e.g. <a href="../images/Calgon.jpg">Calgon</a>, which reacts with the calcium and magnesium ions to produce soluble 
 substances that do not react with soap.<br>
 3. Add chelating agents, e.g. Versene, the tetra sodium salt of ethylene-diamine 
 tetra ethanoic acid, EDTA, that combines with 
 unwanted metal ions.<br>
 4. Pass water through an ion exchange resin in an ion exchange column, 
 e.g. zeolite (Permutit) that removes the calcium and magnesium 
 ions from the water as insoluble solids.<br>
 These chemicals "soften" water by removing all minerals to form demineralized 
 water that is as free from ionic substances as deionized 
 water.<br>
 The last two processes do not form a scum that can discolour laundry.<br>
 The Permutit process is the best for producing drinking water.<br>
 The hardness of water depends on how much calcium and magnesium salts 
 are present.<br>
 In natural stretches of water, these salts are mainly hydrogen carbonates, 
 besides sulfates, silicates, chlorides, nitrates and phosphates 
 in much smaller amounts.<br>
 On boiling the water, the hydrogen carbonates are almost entirely precipitated 
 as insoluble carbonates, so the hardness caused by these 
 salts decreases.<br>
 The remaining hardness is non-carbonate hardness, permanent, hardness.<br>
 Ca(HCO3)2 --> CaCO3 + CO2 + 
 H2O (in boiling water)<br>
 The sum of the carbonate (temporary) hardness and non-carbonate (permanent) 
 hardness is the total hardness of water.<br>
 It is expressed in degrees of hardness.<br>
 One degree of hardness corresponds to a content of 10 mg of calcium oxygen per litre of water.<br>
 In Germany, this is symbolized by dH.<br>
 Water with a hardness less than 4<sup>o</sup> dH is described as very 
 soft.<br>
 Water with a hardness of 8 to 12<sup>o</sup> dH is described as moderately
 hard, between 12 and 18<sup>o</sup> dH fairly hard, between 18 and 30<sup>o</sup>
 dH 
 as hard, and above 30<sup>o </sup>dH very hard.<br>
 Water hardness is important technically and from the point of view of 
 health hygiene.<br>
 It affects the taste of food and drink.<br>
 Water with a hardness greater than 25<sup>o</sup> dH acts as a laxative.<br>
 An increase in the hardness of water causes an increase in how much soap 
 is used, because of the formation of insoluble calcium and 
 magnesium soaps that neither foam nor clean.<br>
 Hardness also causes precipitation of chalk, boiler scale, in pipes and 
 vessels.<br>
 Very soft water tastes insipid and exerts a bad effect on tooth and bone 
 formation.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.4.2H"></a>12.4.2 Tests for water hardness<br>
 The test-tube of the water hardness test set is filled up to the 5 mL 
 graduation mark with the water sample, a level spoonful of indicator 
 powder is added, and the mixture is stirred.<br>
 If calcium or magnesium salts are present, the water sample turns red-violet, 
 in their absence it turns green.<br>
 If a red-violet coloration is produced, i.e. if the water possesses a 
 definite hardness, the tablets, each corresponding to 5<sup>o</sup> dH, added 
 in succession until the colour of the water sample turns to green.<br>
 Each individual tablet must be completely dissolved before the next one 
 is added.<br>
 To help this process, the tablets are crushed with the special tamping 
 rod provided for this purpose.<br>
 Since one table corresponds to 5 degrees of hardness, the exact end point 
 from red-violet to green will usually be greatly exceeded.<br>
 Repeat the test by first dissolving in the water sample one 5<sup>o</sup> 
 dH tablet fewer than used in the preliminary test.<br>
 As many 1<sup>o</sup> dH tablets are then added until the colour of the 
 water sample just turns green.<br>
 The degree of hardness of the water is obtained by adding up the hardness 
 values of the tablets used, e.g. if three 5<sup>o</sup> dH tablets and 
 two 1<sup>o </sup>dH tablets were used to produce the colour change, 
 the water has a total hardness of 17<sup>o</sup> dH.<br>
 The hardness value of the tablets is shown on the package containing
them.<br>
 To find hardness exactly, i.e. to within 0.5<sup>o </sup>dH, fill the 
 test-tube to the 10 mL mark, add two level spoonfuls of indicator powder, 
 stir, 
 and add tablets with half the hardness value, i.e. 2.5<sup>o</sup> or 
 0.5<sup>o</sup> dH, until the colour just turns green.<br>

 hardness using standard soap solution<br>
 Standard soap solution is of such strength that 1 cc contains sufficient
 soap to exactly neutralize one milligram (0.001 g) of dissolved 
 calcium carbonate.<br>
 Soft water contains no mineral impurities.<br>
 Rain water is the purest kind of natural soft water.<br>
 Waters for domestic uses may be divided into two general classes, hard 
 waters and soft waters.<br>
 Hard waters can be either permanently hard, temporarily hard, or both 
 permanently and temporarily hard.<br>
 By hardness of water is meant its soap destroying or neutralizing power, 
 which is due to the presence of carbonates or sulfates of or 
 magnesia.<br>
 A large degree of permanent hardness indicates a bad water.<br>
 Permanently hard waters contain sulfates of lime or magnesia in solution.<br>
 Temporarily hard waters contain carbonates of lime or magnesia in solution,

 Dilute solution A with 80% ethanol until 1 mL of the resulting solution
 is equivalent to 1 mL of solution B, after making allowance for 
 the lather.<br>
 This is the amount of standard soap solution needed to form a permanent
 lather in 50 mL of deionized water.<br>
 One cubic centimetre of the adjusted solution is equivalent to 1 mg of 
 calcium carbonate.<br>

 oil soap), with 1.0 litre methylated spirits and 0.5 litre of deionized

<hr width="100%" size="2">3. To determine the degree of hardness in water, 
 put 70 cc of water in a clean 2 litre glass bottle and slowly add standard

 If a lather forms that disappears in soft water or remains as a curd
in hard water will form, add more standard soap solution while 
 shaking the bottle until the lather formed can stand for five minutes.<br>
 The number of cc soap solution added, less one, indicates the hardness
 of the water in degrees.<br>
 The 1 cc is deducted, because even distilled water requires 
 a small quantity of soap to make it lather.<br>

 5. Originally the hardness of water was defined as the capacity of water 
 for destroying the lather of soap.<br>
 The hardness was determined by a titration with a standard soap solution.<br>
 Metal ions have the ability to cause hardness.<br>
 Nowadays, water hardness means the total calcium and magnesium ion concentration 
 expressed as calcium carbonate concentration.<br>
 However, with an electrode, the total water hardness can be determined
 directly in the range of 1-1000 ppm as calcium carbonate.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.5.14H"></a>12.5.14 Tests for metal ions in water, EDTA chelates<br>
 The different forms of hardness are expressed as "calcium carbonate hardness".<br>
 EDTA is [ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid, HOOCCH2)2N(CH2)2N(CH2COOH)2].<br>
 The disodium salt of EDTA combines with metals to form chelates.<br>
 Chelates are compounds where a multidentate ligand, e.g. as an enolate
 anion of a diketone, is bound to a central atom of a 
 co-ordination complex.<br>
 EDTA is a complexone and is used in special soaps to remove metal contamination 
 and as a chelating agent for 
 analytical determination of metal contamination.<br>
 It is available as "EDTA (0.5 M)", which is a concentrated volumetric 
 solution for dilution to prepare 1 litre of 0.5 M standard solution.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">1. Prepare a 0.01 M EDTA solution by dissolving
 1.861 g in 500 mL water.<br>
 2. Prepare pH 11 buffer solutions by adding 7.0 g ammonium chloride solution 
 to 57 mL of concentrated aqueous ammonia solution.<br>

 3. Prepare an approximate 0.01 M solution MgCl2.6H2O

 4. Eriochrome Black T or Erio T indicator is the indicator for determining
 Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> with EDTA.<br>
 Dissolve 0.2 g EDTA powder in aqueous ammonia solution.<br>
 Pour 100 mL of the water to be tested in a conical flask on white paper.<br>
 Add 1.0 mL of the Mg<sup>2+</sup> solution, 3 drops of "Erio T" indicator 
 solution and 1 mL of the buffer solution.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.4.5H"></a>12.4.5 Tests for water
 hardness, EDTA titration, Calmagite indicator<br>
 The usual form of EDTA used for measuring water hardness is Na2EDTA.2H2O, 
 the ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium 
 dihydrate salt.<br>
 In this ion exchange reaction, the EDTA is in the sodium form and only 
 the cation Ca<sup>2+</sup> is removed.<br>
 Let RZ = the ion exchange resin.<br>
 2RZ-SO3<sup>- </sup>Na<sup>+</sup> + Ca<sup>2+</sup> &lt;--> 
 (RZ-SO3<sup>-</sup>)2Ca<sup>2+</sup> + 2Na<sup>+</sup><br>
 Make the following solution: 5.0 mL of water sample, 1.0 mL of 1.5 M
NH3 / 0.3 M NH4Cl buffer, 0.1 mL of 2% ascorbic acid 
 solution, 1.0 mL of 0.01 M Na2MgEDTA / 0.1 M NH3
 solution, 3 drops of<br>0.1% Calmagite indicator.<br>
 The buffer keeps the hydrogen ion concentration of the solution at the 
 optimum value.<br>
 The ascorbic acid solution prevents oxidation of the indicator.<br>
 Titrate the solution with 0.01 M Na2EDTA (Na2EDTA.2H2O)
 until the colour of the solution changes from red to blue.<br>
 Repeat with a blank titration 5.0 mL of deionized water instead of the 
 water sample.<br>
 Subtract the volume the blank titration from the volume of the water
sample titration.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">1. Calculate the water hardness in units of millimoles
 per litre, i.e. the sum of the calcium and magnesium ion concentrations.<br>
 2. Calculate the water hardness in units of parts per million of CaCO3 
 (ppm, 1 ppm = 1 mg per litre), 
 i.e. milligrams of CaCO3 per litre, assuming that the ions 
 titrated came from CaCO3.<br>
 Magnesium usually also occurs in hard water, but this second calculation
 is often used by water engineers for convenience.<br>
 (mg CaCO3 / L) = (mmol Ca<sup>2+</sup> + Mg<sup>2+</sup> / 
 L) × (1 mol CaCO3 / mol Ca<sup>2+</sup> + Mg<sup>2+</sup>) × (100
g CaCO3 / mol CaCO3).<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.4.6H"></a>12.4.6 Tests for water
 hardness, EDTA titration, Eriochrome Black T indicator<br>
 1. Use Eriochrome Black T indicator and titrate with EDTA.<br>
 Check that the pH is 10 when adding the buffer, using a pH meter.<br>
 Use Eriochrome black T indicator that has been ground with salt rather 
 than a liquid.<br>
 EBT is blue in a buffered solution at pH 10.<br>
 It turns red when Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions are added.<br>
 At the blue end-point, sufficient EDTA has been added, the metal ions 
 are chelated by EDTA, to leave the free indicator molecule.<br>
 Eriochrome Black T, C20H12N3O7SNa, 
 is blue in protonated form, but turns red when forming a complex with
 Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and some other metal ions.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">2. Hardness Ratings (mg CaCO3/L equivalent): &lt;
 15 very soft; 15-50 soft; 50-100 medium hard; 100-300 hard; &gt; 300 very 
 hard<br>
 3. The quantity of hardness ions will be determined by titration.<br>
 EDTA, a weak acid, will be used as the titrant.<br>
 In its ionized form, it is able to form soluble complexes with calcium 
 and magnesium cations.<br>
 The indicator added to the sample is Eriochrome Black T.<br>
 Initially, the indicator will form a complex with the cations.<br>
 When complexed it is red in colour.<br>
 As the EDTA is added dropwise to the sample, it replaces the Erio T and 
 forms more stable complexes with calcium and magnesium.<br>
 When the indicator is released by the metal ions, it has a distinct blue 
 colour.<br>
 Therefore, the endpoint of the titration is marked by the colour change
 from red to blue.<br>
 To determine the hardness of water by measuring the concentrations of 
 calcium and magnesium in water samples by titration.<br>
 The titration should be completed within 5 minutes of buffer addition.<br>
 Some metal ions may interfere in the titration by causing fading or indistinct 
 end points.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Experiment<br>
 1. Clean a 25 mL volumetric pipette by rinsing it with 10% HCl, then
2 washes of distilled water.<br>
 Hold the pipette horizontally and rotate it so that the liquid washes 
 all the inside surfaces.<br>
 Place the pipette on a towel.<br>
 Label all glassware .<br>
 Clean and fill the burette<br>
 2. Titrant solution: Pour about 100 mL of 0.01M EDTA titrant solution 
 into a 250 mL beaker<br>
 3. Analysis solution: Pipette 25 mL of the water sample into a conical
flask and dilute it with 25 mL distilled water.<br>
 Add at least one mL of pH 10 buffer solution to the sample.<br>
 The pH should be 10, so check the pH with pH paper or a pH meter.<br>
 4. Add a 1-2 drops Eriochrome Black T indicator (or a small scoop of
powder indicator formulation) to the conical flask.<br>
 The solution should now be red / pink.<br>
 5. Titration: Test 1. Immediately begin to titrate the sample two drops 
 at a time.<br>
 Be careful to titrate slowly near the endpoint, as the colour will take 
 about 5 seconds to develop.<br>
 Thus, add the last few drops at 3-5 second intervals.<br>
 The endpoint colour is blue.<br>
 6. Perform this procedure at least two more times, Test 2 and Test 3.<br>
 The titre volumes should be within 0.1 mL of each other.<br>

 Express hardness as parts per million (mg per litre) of equivalent CaCO3.<br>
 If the titration required 5 mL EDTA, the calculation is as follows:<br>
 (5 mL 0.01 M EDTA / 0.025 L sample) x ( 1 mg equivalent CaCO3 / 1 mL
0.01 M EDTA) = 200 ppm CaCO3<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.5.16H"></a>12.5.16 Water softening using ion exchange resin<br>
 The charge on Ca<sup>2+</sup> is greater than the charge on Na<sup>+</sup> 
 so the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions have a stronger attraction to -ve groups attached
 to the ion 
 exchange resin.<br>
 Add 2 g of dry cation exchange resin to 50 mL of tap water sample.<br>
 Rotate the mixture in a flask for 10 minutes to produce soft water.<br>
 Titrate a 5.0 mL sample of the soft water with 0.0100 M Na2EDTA.<br>
 Calculate the percentage of water hardness removed by ion exchange:<br>
 [(mmol / L (Ca + Mg) tap water - mmol / L (Ca + Mg) soft water) / mmol 
 / L (Ca + Mg) tap water] × 100<br>
 The exchange capacity is usually found on the label of the bottle of
resin, expressed in milliequivalents (meq), per gram of dry resin or 
 in milliequivalents per millilitre of resin bed.<br>
 For example for a resin of 1.7 meq / mL, 1 mL of resin can exchange about 
 1.7 mmol of charge (1.7 mmol of Na<sup>+</sup> ion).<br>
 The resin is expensive so keep it for regeneration by washing it in concentrated 
 sodium chloride 
 solution then washing it with water.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.5.8H"></a>12.5.8 Prepare cup of tea<br>
 1. The traditional advice is to use freshly drawn water every time you 
 make a cup of tea and the traditional explanation was that water 
 that had been reboiled or boiled many times contained less oxygen, causing 
 less tea to be extracted from the tea leaves so the tea tastes 
 "flat".<br>
 Dissolved oxygen is supposed to make the tea taste better.<br>
 Make two cups of tea with once boiled water and many times boiled water.<br>
 Note any difference in taste and colour.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">2. Aluminium kettles may cause a bad taste in tea
 if used without first adding water.<br>
 However, the bad taste is eliminated by boiling and discarding the contents 
 many times to discard aluminium ions and allowing a patina 
 of aluminium oxide to form inside the kettle to prevent loss of aluminium
 ions into solution.<br>
 Modern kettles may not have the same problem, but the calcium and magnesium
 bicarbonates, chlorides, and sulfates in tap water may 
 affect the taste of tea.<br>
 Clean kettle "fur" with vinegar, then rinse with cold water many times.<br>
 Make two cups of tea with once boiled deionized water and once boiled 
 tap water.<br>
 Note any difference in taste and colour.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">3. Temporary hard water contains bicarbonates, 
which precipitate as insoluble carbonates as a white scum (kettle fur), 
on cooling after 
 boiling, even after reboiling.<br>
 Such precipitates affect the taste of tea even more than the soluble
bicarbonates.<br>
 Also salts in water not destabilized by boiling become more concentrated
 by evaporation during repeated boiling to a concentration that 
 can affect the taste of tea.<br>
 Also, copper and iron ions can react with phenolic reducing agents in 
 tea to produce undesirable tastes.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">4. Brewing guideline for herbal tea.<br>
 (1) For hot tea, use about one gram of dried herbal tea per cup.<br>
 Follow the water and timing specification on the packet for each kind

 (2) For chilled herbal tea prepare the tea as with for hot tea and then leave 
 to chill for eight hours.<br>
 Add flavour or garnish with any natural edible her, fruit, vegetable 
 or flower just prior to serving.<br>
 For a room temperature brew use about two gram s per cup and triple
the timing specifications.<br>
 After it reaches room temperature leave to chill for eight hours.<br>
