<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.11.5.0H">12.11.5.0</a> Group analysis<br>
 A saturated solution can remain in equilibrium with undissolved molecules of the solute.<br>
 Two equilibria exist: 1. an equilibrium between the undissolved solute and dissolved molecules, and<br>
 2. an equilibrium between dissolved molecules and ions formed by dissociation<br>
 (XY) &lt;--> XY &lt;--> X+ + Y-<br>
 Equilibrium 1.: (XY) &lt;--> XY<br>
 Equilibrium 2.: XY &lt;--> X+ + Y-<br>
 (XY) = undissolved molecules<br>
 XY = dissolved, but unionized molecules<br>
 X+ + Y- = ions<br>
 The tendency of the solid to pass into solution depends on its active mass, solution pressure.<br>
 If the temperature remains constant, the active mass remains constant.<br>
 This happens because, by the law of mass action, concentration dissolved molecules / concentration undissolved molecules = the constant, K.<br>
 The concentration of dissolved molecules is also a constant.<br>
 By the law of mass action, if [concentration X+] [concentration Y-] / [concentration dissolved molecules] = a constant, in a saturated solution<br> 
 Then the product of the concentrations of the ions is a constant.<br>
 If large concentrations of different ions are brought together into the same solution,<br> 
 then ions of X+ and Y- will precipitate out of solution as solid molecules until the concentrations of the remaining ions in solution have  the product of their concentrations equals the specific constant, the solubility product.<br>
Group I<br>
 Lead, silver and mercury (I) are precipitated as chlorides by chloride ions from hydrochloric acid.<br>
 The concentrations of silver and chloride ions that can remain in solution are small.<br>
 When a solution of a silver salt containing silver ions is mixed with hydrochloric acid, most of the silver and chloride ions form molecular silver chloride and leave the solution as a solid phase until 
the remaining ions attain equilibrium.<br>
 (concentration silver ions) × (concentration chloride ions) = 1 × 10-10, the solubility product.<br>
 The solubility product has a constant value, so adding excess chloride ions reduces the concentration of the silver ions to a negligible quantity.<br>
 Only silver chloride, lead chloride and mercury (I) chloride have low solubility products.<br>
 So the ions of other metals remain in solution in the presence of high concentrations of chloride ions.<br>
Group II<br>
 Assume hydrogen sulfide is ionized<br>
 H2S &lt;--> 2H+ + S2-<br>
 By the law of mass action (concentration H+)2 × (concentration S2-) / (concentration unionized H2S) = the constant, 1.1 × 10-22.<br>
 In a neutral solution, the concentration of sulfide ions is low, because hydrogen sulfide is a weak electrolyte.<br>
 The concentration of hydrogen ions is also low.<br>
 In the acid solution used for Group II, the concentration of hydrogen ions is increased by the presence of the strong acid.<br>
 So to maintain the value of the solubility product constant, the concentration of the sulfide ion is reduced below its already small value in neutral solution.<br>
 However, the amount of sulfide ions is enough to allow the solubility products of the sulfides of mercury (II), lead, copper and bismuth to be exceeded.<br>
 Also, cadmium sulfide may precipitate if the acid is not too concentrated.<br>
 So in Group II, all the sulfides of mercury (II), lead, copper, bismuth and cadmium precipitate.<br>
 Solubility products:<br>
 Lead sulfide 4 × 10-28, Copper sulfide 8 × 10-45, Mercury (II) sulfide 4 × 10-54,<br>
 Cadmium sulfide 3.6 × 10-29, Manganese sulfide 1.4 × 10-15, Zinc sulfide 1.2 × 10-24<br>
 The concentration of sulfide ion in acid solution is not enough to allow the higher solubility products of the sulfides of manganese, zinc, cobalt or nickel to be reached with any possible concentration of the metal 
ion, so these sulfides do not precipitate.<br>
 They precipitate later in Group IV, where the precipitating agent is the highly ionized salt, ammonium sulfide, and the concentration of the sulfide ion from it is high.<br>
 Group III<br>
 The precipitating agent is ammonia solution.<br>
 NH4OH &lt;--> NH4+ + OH-<br>
By the law of mass action: (concentration NH4+) × (concentration OH-) / (concentration unionized NH4OH) = a constant.<br>
 Ammonia solution is a weak base, so does not ionize much and the value of the constant is only about 2 × 10-5.<br>
 Most of the ammonia solution will be dissolved, but not ionized.<br>
 The small hydroxyl ion concentration in a solution of ammonia solution that is also fairly concentrated with respect to ammonium chloride is still large enough to cause a precipitation of the hydroxides
 of ferric iron, chromium and aluminium, but not great enough to precipitate the hydroxides of zinc, manganese, cobalt and nickel.<br>
 Manganese hydroxide may precipitate slightly if the concentration of ammonium chloride is not sufficiently great.<br>
 Group IV<br>
 In Group II the presence of hydrogen ions from the added acid reduces the concentration of sulfide ions, but this reduced value was enough to allow the solubility products of the metallic sulfides in the group to be exceeded.<br>
 In Group IV, hydrogen sulfide is added to a solution made alkaline with ammonia solution and so contains excess of hydroxyl ions.<br>
 By the law of mass action: (concentration H+)2 × (concentration S2-) / (concentration unionized H2S) = a constant.<br>
 The ionic product of water [H+] × [OH-1] = (10-14).<br>
 The hydroxyl ions from the ammonia solution lower the concentration of hydrogen ions causing an increased concentration of S2- ion.<br>
 In Group IV, the metal sulfides not already precipitated in Group II, because of their high solubility products, precipitate.<br>
So the ionic concentration of the sulfide ion is controlled by variation of the concentration of the ions it is associated with, i.e. hydrogen ions.<br>
 Group V<br>
 The metals still remaining in solution include barium, strontium, calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium.<br>
 Barium, strontium and calcium are precipitated as carbonates by the addition of CO32- ions in alkaline solution, because of the low values of the solubility products, 
 [X2+] × [CO32-] = K< between 10-8 and 10-9.<br>
 The solubility product of magnesium carbonate is low, 10-5, and in neutral solution would be precipitated, but its precipitation is prevented in this group by the ammonium ions, mainly from<br>the ammonium
 chloride added before Group III.<br>
 With the large NH4+ ion concentration from this source, the concentration of CO32- ions is reduced below the concentration to precipitate magnesium as a carbonate.<br>
 [NH4+]2 [CO32-] / [NH4)2CO3] = K.<br>

 1. Add 2 mL nitric acid or tartaric acid to 4 cm water in a test-tube.<br> 
 Add blue litmus paper, which then turns red.<br> 
 Add drops of dilute ammonia solution or washing soda solution, Na2CO3.10H2O, but stop when the solution just turns blue again.<br> 
 The acid is now neutralized by the alkali.<br> 
 2. Put 3 mL dilute sodium hydroxide solution on a watch glass.<br> 
 Use a dropper to add dilute hydrochloric acid drop by drop while stirring continuously and testing the mixture with a fresh piece of litmus paper after each drop is added.<br> 
 You can get a mixture where the litmus paper is neither red nor blue, but a tint midway between these two colours.<br> 
 This mixture does not have the taste of an acid or the feel of an alkali.<br> 
 The solution has the properties neither of an acid nor of an alkali.<br> 
 The acid and alkali have neutralized each other.<br> 
 Evaporate the solution to dryness by heating the watch glass over a beaker of boiling water.<br> 
 A small quantity of solid appears on the watch glass.<br> 
 This crystalline solid is sodium chloride, common salt.<br> 
 Water is also a product of the reaction of sodium hydroxide with hydrochloric acid.<br>

 magnesium hydroxide (s) + sulfuric acid (aq) --> water (l) + magnesium sulfate (aq)<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.8.3H">12.8.3</a> Simple titration of acids and bases<br>
 Titration is an experimental method for measuring the concentration of a solution.<br> 
 Measure the volume of the solution "A" needed to react with a given volume of solution "B".<br> 
 For HCl and NaOH titration, molarity "A" X volume "A" = molarity "B" X Volume "B".<br> 
 The end point in a titration occurs when an indicator changes colour.<br> 
 Use a medicine dropper or a teat pipette as a simple burette.<br> 
 The drops must always be the same size.<br> 
 Within experimental error, when the same dropper is used, the same number of drops of alkali is needed to neutralize the same number of drops of acid.<br> 
 When the concentration of the acid is known, the concentration of the base can be estimated by comparing the numbers of drops of acid and drops of base that just react.<br> 
 Drop 100 drops of water from a medicine dropper into a measuring cylinder.<br> 
 Calculate the volume of one drop.<br> 
 Measure 25 mL of 2 M sodium hydroxide solution in the measuring cylinder and pour into an evaporating dish.<br> 
 Add 2 drops of phenolphthalein solution and note the red colour of the indicator.<br> 
 Wash the medicine dropper with the 2 M hydrochloric acid to get rid of remaining sodium hydroxide.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2">1. Wash a burette as follows:<br>
 1.1 Use a filter funnel to fill a burette with 20 mL of water.<br> 
 1.2 Hold the burette horizontally and rotate it slowly to wash the inner wall.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2">2. Fill the burette as follows:<br>
 2.1 Fill the burette too below the zero mark with 1.0 M sulfuric acid.<br> 
 2.2 Clamp the burette vertically in a stand.<br> 
 2.3 Open the stopcock for a few seconds to fill the burette jet completely with the acid.<br>

 3.1 Using a pipette filler, suck sufficient water into a pipette to fill part of the bulb.<br> 
 (Never use your mouth to suck a pipette.)<br>
 3.2 Hold the pipette horizontally.<br> 
 Rotate it slowly so that the water washes the inner wall, up to the graduation mark.<br> 
 3.3 Allow the water to run out into the sink.<br>

 5.1 Empty the conical flask and rinse it with water.<br> 
 5.2 Use a pipette filler to pipette 25.0 mL of 2.0 M sodium hydroxide solution into the flask.<br> 
 Do not add any indicator to allow preparation of pure sodium sulfate crystals.<br> 
 5.3 From the burette, add the same volume of sulfuric acid as calculated from 4.6, i.e. (V2- V1) mL.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2">Measure acidity using a titration kit<br>
 To measure T.A. in wine, use an inexpensive titration or acid test kit.<br> 
 Test kits can be purchased cheaply and can be used over and over again.<br> 
 The amount of acid in must or wine is measured by slowly adding a small amount of the reagent base sodium hydroxide until a change in colour occurs from the indicator phenolphthalein.<br> 
 Put a 15 cc sample (one cc equals one ml) of must or wine into a test-tube.<br> 
 Most test tubes that come with the acid test kits are marked with a line indicating this volume, or use a small plastic syringe in the test kit to measure the desired amount into the test tube.<br> 
 Then rinse the syringe.<br> 
 Put 3 drops of the phenolphthalein solution into the test-tube.<br> 
 Swirl or shake the test tube to mix the indicator with the must or wine.<br> 
 Use the syringe to draw out 10 cc of the sodium hydroxide reagent, with no bubbles in the liquid.<br> 
 Be careful! Avoid contact of the sodium hydroxide solution with your skin or eyes.<br> 
 Add the sodium hydroxide solution to the test-tube, by 0.5 cc at a time.<br> 
 After each addition of 0.5 cc, swirl or shake the test-tube to mix the contents.<br> 
 The colour of the liquid will momentarily change upon the addition of the reagent.<br> 
 If testing white wines, the colour change will be pink.<br> 
 If testing red wines, the colour change will be grey.<br> 
 Keep swirling the test-tube until the colour subsides.<br> 
 If the colour of the must or wine returns to the original colour, repeat adding 0.5 cc until the colour change is permanent.<br> 
 So when the colour, pink or grey, does not go away, stop and record the amount of reagent used.<br> 
 To determine the acidity of the must or wine, for each cc of reagent used, equals 0.1 % TA.<br> 
 For example, if you used 6 cc of sodium hydroxide to react with the must or wine, the titrarable acidity is 0.6 %.<br> 
 Discard the sample, because it is now toxic.<br> 
 Do not add the sample back into your original must or wine!<br>
 Wash and dry the test equipment before storing it.<br>

 Conventional titration vs microscale titration:<br>
 Conventional titration requires burettes, bulb pipettes and litres of solutions.<br> 
 Ten microscale titrations will use fewer solutions than used for one conventional titration.<br> 
 Burettes are large and fragile so spillage and breakage of glassware occur sometimes.<br> 
 When an operator using conventional titration does three measurements, a microscale operator can do six to ten measurements.<br> 
 Microscale titration does require different hand and finger skills than conventional titration and involves some differences in the calculation methods.<br>

 Record the final pipette volumes For each titration, calculate the ratio of acid volume to alkali volume to allow concordance between titrations.<br> 
 Discard discordant values and calculate the mean for accepted values.<br> 
 Ratio 1 = volume 0.1 M monoprotic acid / volume 0.1 M sodium hydroxide<br>
 Ratio 2 = volume unknown acid / volume 0.1 M sodium hydroxide<br>
 Concentration of unknown acid = (Ratio 1 / Ratio 2) X concentration 0.1M monoprotic acid, e.g. If Ratio 1 = 1.158, Ratio 2 = 1.079, molarity of unknown acid = (1.158 / 1.079) X 0.1 = 0.1073 M.<br> 
 Addition of a drop of the indicator to the acid solutions being measured dilutes the acids, e.g. 0.02 mL of indicator solution added to 15 mL of acid solution dilutes the acid to affect the measured.<br> concentration 
 at the fourth significant figure.<br> 
 However, this titration is done twice, with the "known" standard acid and with the "unknown" acid, so the errors will cancel at the fourth significant figure when the acids do not differ greatly in concentration.<br>
