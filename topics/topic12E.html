 Cations in an unknown solution can be identified by using flame tests.<br> 
 Add drops of concentrated hydrochloric acid to the solution.<br> 
 Dip a clean piece of platinum wire into it then hold it in a Bunsen burner flame.<br> 
 Dip platinum wire into concentrated hydrochloric acid (12 M) then into powdered solid and heat in a non-luminous edge of a Bunsen burner flame.<br> 
 When a salt is heated in the flame, it dissociates into neutral atoms and electrons are excited into a higher energy level then return to the ground state and emits light of characteristic colour for that atom.<br> 
 Remember that each person observes colours differently.<br> 
 The non-metal atoms in anions do emit light, but at wavelengths shorter than ultraviolet light, so we cannot see the colours.<br> 
 Experiments<br>
 Check the flame test colours by doing the test for all the cations against a dark background.<br> 
 Compare with the following list of colours:<br>
 Ammonium compounds: green (faint colour).<br> 
 Antimony: blue-green to light blue (faint colour)<br>
 Arsenic: light blue (moistened with hydrochloric acid)<br>
 Barium: pale green to yellow-green:<br>
 Bismuth: blue<br>
 Calcium: red<br>
 Calcium compounds: brick-red to yellow (masked by barium)<br>
 Copper: blue-green<br>
 Copper compounds: green (not halides) (CuBr2 blue-green)<br>
 Lead: light blue to blue<br>
 Lithium compounds: crimson (masked by barium or sodium)<br>
 Molybdenum: yellow-green:<br>
 Phosphates: blue-green (if when moistened with sulfuric acid).<br> 
 Potassium: lilac, but crimson through blue glass, violet through cobalt glass<br>
 Potassium compounds: pink-lilac to violet (not borates, phosphates, and silicates.) (masked by sodium or lithium).<br> 
 Selenium: blue<br>
 Sodium: strong golden yellow, but no colour viewed through blue glass<br>
 Sodium compounds: yellow (if the yellow flame persists and is not intensified by adding 1% NaCl to the dry compound.)<br>
 Strontium: crimson<br>

1. Water: Try to dissolve the salt in deionized water.<br> 
 If the salt does not dissolve, heat it in a test-tube to observe if the salt dissolves in hot water.<br> 
 2. Dilute hydrochloric acid: If the salt does not dissolve in hot water, add dilute hydrochloric acid to observe if it dissolves.<br> 
 3. Concentrated hydrochloric acid, 2.0 to 5.0 mL: When all substance is dissolved, dilute solution to five times its bulk, then leave to cool.<br> 
 If the dilution produces a precipitate, because of hydrolysis of chlorides of bismuth, antimony or tin, add drops of concentrated hydrochloric acid.<br>

 2. Put 3 mL dilute sodium hydroxide solution on a watch glass.<br> 
 Use a dropper to add dilute hydrochloric acid drop by drop while stirring continuously.<br>
Test the mixture with a fresh piece of litmus paper after each drop is added.<br> 
 You can get a mixture where the litmus paper is neither red nor blue, but a tint midway between these two colours.<br> 
 This mixture does not have the taste of an acid or the feel of an alkali.<br> 
 The solution has the properties neither of an acid nor of an alkali.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2">Measure acidity using a titration kit<br>
 To measure T.A. in wine, use an inexpensive titration or acid test kit.<br> 
 Test kits can be purchased cheaply and can be used over and over again.<br> 
 The amount of acid in wine is measured by slowly adding a small amount of the reagent base NaOH until a change in colour occurs from indicator phenolphthalein.<br> 
 Put a 15 cc sample (one cc equals one ml) of wine into a test-tube.<br> 
 Most test tubes that come with the acid test kits are marked with a line indicating this volume, or<br> 
use a small plastic syringe in the test kit to measure the desired amount into the test tube.<br> 
 Then rinse the syringe.<br> 
 Put 3 drops of the phenolphthalein solution into the test-tube.<br> 
 Swirl or shake the test tube to mix the indicator with the wine.<br> 
 Use the syringe to draw out 10 cc of the sodium hydroxide reagent, with no bubbles in the liquid.<br> 
 Be careful! Avoid contact of the sodium hydroxide solution with your skin or eyes.<br> 
 Add the sodium hydroxide solution to the test-tube, by 0.5 cc at a time.<br> 
 After each addition of 0.5 cc, swirl or shake the test-tube to mix the contents.<br> 
 The colour of the liquid will momentarily change upon the addition of the reagent.<br> 
 If testing white wines, the colour change will be pink.<br> 
 If testing red wines, the colour change will be grey.<br> 
 Keep swirling the test-tube until the colour subsides.<br> 
 If the colour of the wine returns to the original colour, repeat adding 0.5 cc until the colour change is permanent.<br> 
 So when the colour, pink or grey, does not go away, stop and record the amount of reagent used.<br> 
 To determine the acidity of the wine, for each cc of reagent used, equals 0.1 % TA.<br> 
 For example, if you used 6 cc of sodium hydroxide to react with the wine, the titrarable acidity is 0.6 %.<br> 
 Discard the sample, because it is now toxic.<br> 
 Do not add the sample back into your original wine!<br>
 Wash and dry the test equipment before storing it.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.11.4.5H">12.11.4.5</a> Group analysis<br>
 A saturated solution can remain in equilibrium with undissolved molecules of the solute.<br>
 Two equilibria exist: 1. an equilibrium between the undissolved solute and dissolved molecules, and<br>
 2. an equilibrium between dissolved molecules and ions formed by dissociation<br>
 (XY) &lt;--> XY &lt;--> X+ + Y-<br>
 Equilibrium 1.: (XY) &lt;--> XY<br>
 Equilibrium 2.: XY &lt;--> X+ + Y-<br>
 (XY) = undissolved molecules<br>
 XY = dissolved, but unionized molecules<br>
 X+ + Y- = ions<br>
 The tendency of the solid to pass into solution depends on its active mass, solution pressure.<br>
 If the temperature remains constant, the active mass remains constant.<br>
 This happens because, by the law of mass action, concentration dissolved molecules / concentration undissolved molecules = the constant, K.<br>
 The concentration of dissolved molecules is also a constant.<br>
 By the law of mass action, if [concentration X+] [concentration Y-] / [concentration dissolved molecules] = a constant, in a saturated solution<br> 
 Then the product of the concentrations of the ions is a constant.<br>
 If large concentrations of different ions are brought together into the same solution,<br> 
 then ions of X+ and Y- will precipitate out of solution as solid molecules until the concentrations of the remaining ions in solution have the product of their concentrations equals the specific constant, the solubility product.<br>
Group I<br>
 Lead, silver and mercury (I) are precipitated as chlorides by chloride ions from hydrochloric acid.<br>
 The concentrations of silver and chloride ions that can remain in solution are small.<br>
 When a solution of a silver salt containing silver ions is mixed with hydrochloric acid, most of the silver and chloride ions form molecular silver chloride and leave the solution as a solid phase until 
the remaining ions attain equilibrium.<br>
 (concentration silver ions) × (concentration chloride ions) = 1 × 10-10, the solubility product.<br>
 The solubility product has a constant value, so adding excess chloride ions reduces the concentration of the silver ions to a negligible quantity.<br>
 Only silver chloride, lead chloride and mercury (I) chloride have low solubility products.<br>
 So the ions of other metals remain in solution in the presence of high concentrations of chloride ions.<br>
Group II<br>
 Assume hydrogen sulfide is ionized<br>
 H2S &lt;--> 2H+ + S2-<br>
 By the law of mass action (concentration H+)2 × (concentration S2-) / (concentration unionized H2S) = the constant, 1.1 × 10-22.<br>
 In a neutral solution, the concentration of sulfide ions is low, because hydrogen sulfide is a weak electrolyte.<br>
 The concentration of hydrogen ions is also low.<br>
 In the acid solution used for Group II, the concentration of hydrogen ions is increased by the presence of the strong acid.<br>
 So to maintain the value of the solubility product constant, the concentration of the sulfide ion is reduced below its already small value in neutral solution.<br>
 However, the amount of sulfide ions is enough to allow the solubility products of the sulfides of mercury (II), lead, copper and bismuth to be exceeded.<br>
 Also, cadmium sulfide may precipitate if the acid is not too concentrated.<br>
 So in Group II, all the sulfides of mercury (II), lead, copper, bismuth and cadmium precipitate.<br>
 Solubility products:<br>
 Lead sulfide 4 × 10-28, Copper sulfide 8 × 10-45, Mercury (II) sulfide 4 × 10-54,<br>
 Cadmium sulfide 3.6 × 10-29, Manganese sulfide 1.4 × 10-15, Zinc sulfide 1.2 × 10-24<br>
 The concentration of sulfide ion in acid solution is not enough to allow the higher solubility products of the sulfides of manganese, zinc, cobalt or nickel to be reached with any possible concentration of the metal 
ion, so these sulfides do not precipitate.<br>
 They precipitate later in Group IV, where the precipitating agent is the highly ionized salt, ammonium sulfide, and the concentration of the sulfide ion from it is high.<br>
 Group III<br>
 The precipitating agent is ammonia solution.<br>
 NH4OH &lt;--> NH4+ + OH-<br>
By the law of mass action: (concentration NH4+) × (concentration OH-) / (concentration unionized NH4OH) = a constant.<br>
 Ammonia solution is a weak base, so does not ionize much and the value of the constant is only about 2 × 10-5.<br>
 Most of the ammonia solution will be dissolved, but not ionized.<br>
 The small hydroxyl ion concentration in a solution of ammonia solution that is also fairly concentrated with respect to ammonium chloride is still large enough to cause a precipitation of the hydroxides
 of ferric iron, chromium and aluminium, but not great enough to precipitate the hydroxides of zinc, manganese, cobalt and nickel.<br>
 Manganese hydroxide may precipitate slightly if the concentration of ammonium chloride is not sufficiently great.<br>
 Group IV<br>
 In Group II the presence of hydrogen ions from the added acid reduces the concentration of sulfide ions, but this reduced value was enough to allow the solubility products of the metallic sulfides in the group to be exceeded.<br>
 In Group IV, hydrogen sulfide is added to a solution made alkaline with ammonia solution and so contains excess of hydroxyl ions.<br>
 By the law of mass action: (concentration H+)2 × (concentration S2-) / (concentration unionized H2S) = a constant.<br>
 The ionic product of water [H+] × [OH-1] = (10-14).<br>
 The hydroxyl ions from the ammonia solution lower the concentration of hydrogen ions causing an increased concentration of S2- ion.<br>
 In Group IV, the metal sulfides not already precipitated in Group II, because of their high solubility products, precipitate.<br>
So the ionic concentration of the sulfide ion is controlled by variation of the concentration of the ions it is associated with, i.e. hydrogen ions.<br>
 Group V<br>
 The metals still remaining in solution include barium, strontium, calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium.<br>
 Barium, strontium and calcium are precipitated as carbonates by the addition of CO32- ions in alkaline solution, because of the low values of the solubility products, 
 [X2+] × [CO32-] = K< between 10-8 and 10-9.<br>
 The solubility product of magnesium carbonate is low, 10-5, and in neutral solution would be precipitated, but its precipitation is prevented in this group by the ammonium ions, mainly from<br>the ammonium
 chloride added before Group III.<br>
 With the large NH4+ ion concentration from this source, the concentration of CO32- ions is reduced below the concentration to precipitate magnesium as a carbonate.<br>
 [NH4+]2 [CO32-] / [NH4)2CO3] = K.<br>

 Titration is an experimental method for measuring the concentration of a solution.<br> 
 Measure the volume of the solution "A" needed to react with a given volume of solution "B".<br> 
 For HCl and NaOH titration, molarity "A" X volume "A" = molarity "B" X Volume "B".<br> 
 The end point in a titration occurs when an indicator changes colour.<br> 
 Use a medicine dropper or a teat pipette as a simple burette.<br> 
 The drops must always be the same size.<br> 
 Within experimental error, when the same dropper is used, the same number of drops of alkali is needed to neutralize the same number of drops of acid.<br> 
 When the concentration of the acid is known, the concentration of the base can be estimated by comparing the numbers of drops of acid and drops of base that just react.<br> 
 Drop 100 drops of water from a medicine dropper into a measuring cylinder.<br> 
 Calculate the volume of one drop.<br>

* Wear protective gloves when handling corrosive chemicals.<br> 
* Handle acids and alkalis with care.<br> 
* If any alkali gets into your eyes or onto your skin, report to your teacher immediately, and wash the affected area under running water for at least three minutes.<br> 
* If any acid gets into your eyes, report to your teacher immediately, and flush your eyes with running water for at least three minutes.<br> 
* If any acid gets onto your skin, wash the affected area with plenty of water.<br> 
* Eye protection must be worn.<br>
* Sodium hydroxide 2.0 M is corrosive.<br>
* Sulfuric acid 1.0 M is an irritant.<br> 
1. Wash a burette as follows:<br>
1.1 Use a filter funnel to fill a burette with 20 mL of water.<br> 
1.2 Hold the burette horizontally and rotate it slowly to wash the inner wall.<br> 
 Open the stopcock to run out all the water into the sink.<br> 
 Close the stopcock.<br> 
 Repeat the above procedure with 1.0 M sulfuric acid.<br> 
2. Fill the burette as follows:<br>
 2.1 Fill the burette too below the zero mark with 1.0 M sulfuric acid.<br> 
 2.2 Clamp the burette vertically in a stand.<br> 
 2.3 Open the stopcock for a few seconds to fill the burette jet completely with the acid.<br> 
 Do not leave any bubbles in the burette jet.<br> 
 2.4 Take the initial burette reading (V1) = mL (to two decimal places).<br> 
3. Wash a pipette as follows:<br>
 3.1 Using a pipette filler, suck sufficient water into a pipette to fill part of the bulb.<br> 
 (Never use your mouth to suck a pipette.)<br>
 3.2 Hold the pipette horizontally.<br> 
 Rotate it slowly so that the water washes the inner wall, up to the graduation mark.<br> 
 3.3 Allow the water to run out into the sink.<br> 
 Repeat 3.1 to 3.3 using 2.0 M sodium hydroxide solution.<br> 
4. Titration:<br>
 4.1 Using the pipette filler and the washed pipette, transfer 25.0 cm of the sodium hydroxide solution into a clean conical flask.<br> 
 4.2. Add 2 drops of methyl orange indicator to the conical flask.<br> 
 Note the colour of the solution in the conical flask.<br> 
 4.3 Run the 1.0 M sulfuric acid into the flask while swirling the flask continuously.<br> 
 4.4 Continue adding the acid, until the solution in the flask just turns to an orange colour.<br> 
 4.5 Take the final burette reading (V2) = mL (to two decimal places).<br> 
 4.6 The volume of sulfuric acid needed to neutralize 25.0 mL of sodium hydroxide solution is (V2 - V1) mL.<br> 
5. Isolation of sodium sulfate crystals from solution:<br>
 5.1 Empty the conical flask and rinse it with water.<br> 
 5.2 Use a pipette filler to pipette 25.0 mL of 2.0 M sodium hydroxide solution into the flask.<br> 
 Do not add any indicator to allow preparation of pure sodium sulfate crystals.<br> 
 5.3 From the burette, add the same volume of sulfuric acid as calculated from 4.6, i.e. (V2- V1) mL.<br> 
 This results in complete neutralization to form a hot concentrated sodium sulfate solution and water.<br> 
 5.4 Pour the resultant solution into a small beaker.<br> 
 5.5 Boil the solution gently to concentrate it.<br> 
 Heat with a small flame, until 1/3 of the solution is left.<br> 
 Do not evaporate the solution until dry, because spitting will occur.<br> 
 5.6 Every 10 seconds, dip a glass rod into the boiling solution and then take it out.<br> 
 If the immersed end becomes "cloudy" within 5 or 6 seconds, stop heating.<br> 
 The solution has now become concentrated enough to deposit crystals on cooling.<br> 
 5.7 Leave the solution to cool overnight.<br> 
 5.8 The next day, sodium sulfate crystals should have formed.<br> 
 5.9 Filter the crystals from the remaining solution.<br> 
 5.10 Wash the crystals with drops of distilled water from a plastic wash bottle.<br> 
 5.11 Use a spatula to transfer the crystals onto a piece of filter paper or absorbent paper.<br> 
 5.12 Dry the crystals by gently pressing them between filter paper of absorbent paper.<br>

 Conventional titration vs microscale titration:<br>
 Conventional titration requires burettes, bulb pipettes and litres of solutions.<br> 
 Ten microscale titrations will use fewer solutions than used for one conventional titration.<br> 
 Burettes are large and fragile so spillage and breakage of glassware occur sometimes.<br> 
 When an operator using conventional titration does three measurements, a microscale operator can do six to ten measurements.<br> 
 Microscale titration does require different hand and finger skills than conventional titration and involves some differences in the calculation methods.<br>

 Ratio 1 = volume 0.1 M monoprotic acid / volume 0.1 M sodium hydroxide<br>
 Ratio 2 = volume unknown acid / volume 0.1 M sodium hydroxide<br>
 Concentration of unknown acid = (Ratio 1 / Ratio 2) X concentration 0.1M monoprotic acid, e.g. If Ratio 1 = 1.158, Ratio 2 = 1.079, molarity of unknown acid = (1.158 / 1.079) X 0.1 = 0.1073 M.<br> 
 Addition of a drop of the indicator to the acid solutions being measured dilutes the acids, e.g. 0.02 mL of indicator solution added to 15 mL of acid solution dilutes the acid to affect the measured.<br> concentration 
 at the fourth significant figure.<br> 
 However, this titration is done twice, with the "known" standard acid and with the "unknown" acid, so the errors will cancel at the fourth significant figure when the acids do not differ greatly in concentration.<br>
