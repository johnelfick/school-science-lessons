<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.11.5.0H">12.11.5.0</a> Group analysis<br>
 A saturated solution can remain in equilibrium with undissolved molecules of the solute.<br>
 Two equilibria exist: 1. an equilibrium between the undissolved solute and dissolved molecules, and 2. an equilibrium between dissolved molecules and ions formed by dissociation<br>
 (XY) &lt;--> XY &lt;--> X<sup>+</sup> + Y<sup>-</sup><br>
 Equilibrium 1.: (XY) &lt;--> XY<br>
 Equilibrium 2.: XY &lt;--> X<sup>+</sup> + Y<sup>-</sup><br>
 (XY) = undissolved molecules<br>
 XY = dissolved, but unionized molecules<br>
 X<sup>+</sup> + Y<sup>-</sup> = ions<br>
 The tendency of the solid to pass into solution depends on its active mass, solution pressure.<br>
 If the temperature remains constant, the active mass remains constant, because, by the law of mass action, concentration dissolved molecules / concentration undissolved molecules = the constant, K.<br>
 The concentration of dissolved molecules is also a constant.<br>
 Also, by the law of mass action, if [concentration X<sup>+</sup>] [concentration Y<sup>-</sup>] / [concentration dissolved molecules] = a constant, in a saturated solution, the product of the concentrations of the ions<br>is a constant.<br>
 So if large concentrations of ions are brought together into the same solution, ions of X<sup>+</sup> and Y<sup>-</sup> will precipitate out of solution as solid 
 molecules until the concentrations of the remaining ions in solution have such values that the product of their concentrations equals the specific constant, the solubility product.<br>
Group I<br>
 Lead, silver and mercury (I) are precipitated as chlorides by chloride ions from hydrochloric acid.<br>
 The concentrations of silver and chloride ions that can remain in solution are small.<br>
 So when a solution of a silver salt containing silver ions is mixed with hydrochloric acid, most of the silver and chloride ions form molecular silver chloride and leave the solution as a solid phase until 
the remaining ions attain equilibrium.<br>
 (concentration silver ions) × (concentration chloride ions) = 1 × 10<sup>-10</sup>, the solubility product.<br>
 The solubility product has a constant value, so adding excess chloride ions reduces the concentration of the silver ions to a negligible quantity.<br>
 Only silver chloride, lead chloride and mercury (I) chloride have low solubility products.<br>
 So the ions of other metals remain in solution in the presence of high concentrations of chloride ions.<br>
Group II<br>
 Assume hydrogen sulfide is ionized<br>
 H2S &lt;--> 2H<sup>+</sup> + S<sup>2-</sup><br>
 By the law of mass action (concentration H<sup>+</sup>)<sup>2</sup> × (concentration S<sup>2-</sup>) / (concentration unionized H2S) = the constant, 1.1 × 10<sup>-22</sup>.<br>
 In a neutral solution, the concentration of sulfide ions is low, because hydrogen sulfide is a weak electrolyte.<br>
 The concentration of hydrogen ions is also low.<br>
 In the acid solution used for Group II, the concentration of hydrogen ions is increased by the presence of the strong acid.<br>
 So to maintain the value of the solubility product constant, the concentration of the sulfide ion is reduced below its already small value in neutral solution.<br>
 However, the amount of sulfide ions is enough to allow the solubility products of the sulfides of mercury (II), lead, copper and bismuth to be exceeded.<br>
 Also, cadmium sulfide may precipitate if the acid is not too concentrated.<br>
 So in Group II, all the sulfides of mercury (II), lead, copper, bismuth and cadmium precipitate.<br>
 Solubility products:<br>
 Lead sulfide 4 × 10<sup>-28</sup>, Copper sulfide 8 × 10<sup>-45</sup>, Mercury (II) sulfide 4 × 10<sup>-54</sup>,<br>
 Cadmium sulfide 3.6 × 10<sup>-29</sup>, Manganese sulfide 1.4 × 10<sup>-15</sup>, Zinc sulfide 1.2 × 10<sup>-24</sup><br>
 The concentration of sulfide ion in acid solution is not enough to allow the higher solubility products of the sulfides of manganese, zinc, cobalt or nickel to be reached with any possible concentration of the metal 
ion, so these sulfides do not precipitate.<br>
 They precipitate later in Group IV, where the precipitating agent is the highly ionized salt, ammonium sulfide, and the concentration of the sulfide ion from it is high.<br>
 Group III<br>
 The precipitating agent is ammonia solution.<br>
 NH4OH &lt;--> NH4<sup>+</sup> + OH<sup>-</sup><br>
By the law of mass action: (concentration NH4<sup>+</sup>) × (concentration OH<sup>-</sup>) / (concentration unionized NH4OH) = a constant.<br>
 Ammonia solution is a weak base, so does not ionize much and the value of the constant is only about 2 × 10<sup>-5</sup>.<br>
 Most of the ammonia solution will be dissolved, but not ionized.<br>
 The small hydroxyl ion concentration in a solution of ammonia solution that is also fairly concentrated with respect to ammonium chloride is still large enough to cause a precipitation of the hydroxides
 of ferric iron, chromium and aluminium, but not great enough to precipitate the hydroxides of zinc, manganese, cobalt and nickel.<br>
 Manganese hydroxide may precipitate slightly if the concentration of ammonium chloride is not sufficiently great.<br>
 Group IV<br>
 In Group II the presence of hydrogen ions from the added acid reduces the concentration of sulfide ions, but this reduced value was enough to allow the solubility products of the metallic sulfides in the group to be exceeded.<br>
 In Group IV, hydrogen sulfide is added to a solution made alkaline with ammonia solution and so contains excess of hydroxyl ions.<br>
 By the law of mass action: (concentration H<sup>+</sup>)<sup>2</sup> × (concentration S<sup>2-</sup>) / (concentration unionized H2S) = a constant.<br>
 The ionic product of water [H<sup>+</sup>] × [OH-<sup>1</sup>] = (10<sup>-14</sup>).<br>
 The hydroxyl ions from the ammonia solution lower the concentration of hydrogen ions causing an increased concentration of S<sup>2-</sup> ion.<br>
 In Group IV, the metal sulfides not already precipitated in Group II, because of their high solubility products, precipitate.<br>
So the ionic concentration of the sulfide ion is controlled by variation of the concentration of the ions it is associated with, i.e. hydrogen ions.<br>
 Group V<br>
 The metals still remaining in solution include barium, strontium, calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium.<br>
 Barium, strontium and calcium are precipitated as carbonates by the addition of CO3<sup>2-</sup> ions in alkaline solution, because of the low values of the solubility products, 
 [X<sup>2+</sup>] × [CO3<sup>2-</sup>] = K< between 10<sup>-8</sup> and 10<sup>-9</sup>.<br>
 The solubility product of magnesium carbonate is low, 10<sup>-5</sup>, and in neutral solution would be precipitated, but its precipitation is prevented in this group by the ammonium ions, mainly from<br>the ammonium
 chloride added before Group III.<br>
 With the large NH4<sup>+</sup> ion concentration from this source, the concentration of CO3<sup>2-</sup> ions is reduced below the concentration to precipitate magnesium as a carbonate.<br>
 [NH4<sup>+</sup>]<sup>2</sup> [CO3<sup>2-</sup>] / [NH4)2CO3] = K.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.8.0H">12.8.0</a> Acid-base neutralization, acid with base forms a salt and water<br>
 In neutralization reactions, an acid and a base react in such proportions as to form a neutral solution of a salt and water.<br> 
 In the home, wool dresses spotted with another colour from acids or bases can be restored to original colour by neutralization.<br> 
 The reaction is between the hydrogen ions and the hydroxide ions.<br> 
 H<sup>+</sup> (aq) + OH<sup>-</sup> (aq) --> H<sub>2</sub>O.<br> 
 Experiments<br>
 1. Add 2 mL nitric acid or tartaric acid to 4 cm water in a test-tube.<br> 
 Add blue litmus paper, which then turns red.<br> 
 Add drops of dilute ammonia solution or washing soda solution, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>.10H<sub>2</sub>O, but stop when the solution just turns blue again.<br> 
 The acid is now neutralized by the alkali.<br> 
 2. Put 3 mL dilute sodium hydroxide solution on a watch glass.<br> 
 Use a dropper to add dilute hydrochloric acid drop by drop while stirring continuously and testing the mixture with a fresh piece of litmus paper after each drop is added.<br> 
 You can get a mixture where the litmus paper is neither red nor blue, but a tint midway between these two colours.<br> 
 This mixture does not have the taste of an acid or the feel of an alkali.<br> 
 The solution has the properties neither of an acid nor of an alkali.<br> 
 The acid and alkali have neutralized each other.<br> 
 Evaporate the solution to dryness by heating the watch glass over a beaker of boiling water.<br> 
 A small quantity of solid appears on the watch glass.<br> 
 This crystalline solid is sodium chloride, common salt.<br> 
 Water is also a product of the reaction of sodium hydroxide with hydrochloric acid.<br> 
 3. Pour about 5 mL of dilute solutions of sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide and ammonia solution into separate test-tubes.<br> 
 Neutralize each alkali solution with dilute hydrochloric acid then evaporate the resulting solutions to dryness.<br> 
 Do not taste the residues.<br> 
 Repeat the procedure with dilute sulfuric acid, dilute nitric acid or
dilute acetic acid.<br>

 [ H<sub>2</sub>O (l) + NH<sub>3</sub> (aq) --> NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> (aq) + OH<sup>-</sup> (aq)].<br> 
4. Add magnesium hydroxide in small amounts to dilute sulfuric acid until excess solid is present.<br> 
 Filter the mixture and test the filtrate with pieces of red and of blue litmus paper.<br> 
 Evaporate the filtrate to dryness.<br> 
 Many metallic hydroxides react with acids to produce water and a salt in the same way as alkalis do.<br> 
 magnesium hydroxide (s) + sulfuric acid (aq) --> water (l) + magnesium sulfate (aq)<br>
 Metallic hydroxides that behave in this way with acids and are insoluble in water are called basic hydroxides.<br> 
 The three classes of compounds (alkalis, basic oxides and basic hydroxides) are representatives of a group of substances called bases.<br>

 acid.<br> 
 When the litmus is neither red nor blue, but between the two colours, 
stop adding drops of acid.<br> 
 Wet the tip of the finger with the mixture.<br> 
 Rub the mixture between the fingers.<br> 
 It does not feel slippery, so the solution is not alkaline.<br> 
 When the correct quantities of hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide 
are mixed a solution forms that has the properties neither of 
 the acid nor of the alkali.<br> 
 The acid and alkali have neutralized each other.<br> 
 Evaporate the neutralized solution to dryness by heating the watch glass

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.8.3H">12.8.3</a> Simple titration of 
 acids and bases<br>
 Titration is an experimental method for measuring the concentration of
a solution.<br> 
 Measure the volume of the solution "A" needed to react with a given volume
of solution "B".<br> 
 For HCl and NaOH titration, molarity "A" X volume "A" = molarity "B" 
X Volume "B".<br> 
 The end point in a titration occurs when an indicator changes colour.<br> 
 Use a medicine dropper or a teat pipette as a simple burette.<br> 
 The drops must always be the same size.<br> 
 Within experimental error, when the same dropper is used, the same number
of drops of alkali is needed to neutralize the same number 
 of drops of acid.<br> 
 When the concentration of the acid is known, the concentration of the
base can be estimated by comparing the numbers of drops of 
 acid and drops of base that just react.<br> 
 Drop 100 drops of water from a medicine dropper into a measuring cylinder.<br> 
 Calculate the volume of one drop.<br> 
 Measure 25 mL of 2 M sodium hydroxide solution in the measuring cylinder 
 and pour into an evaporating dish.<br> 
 Add 2 drops of phenolphthalein solution and note the red colour of the
indicator.<br> 
 Wash the medicine dropper with the 2 M hydrochloric acid to get rid of
remaining sodium hydroxide.<br> 
 Add 2 M hydrochloric acid a drop at a time to the solution in the evaporating
dish.<br> 
 Stir as each drop is added.<br> 
 Note the number of drops added until the colour just disappears completely.<br> 
 Calculate the volume of added acid.<br> 
 Heat the solution until almost dry.<br> 
 Use gentle heat to avoid spattering.<br> 
 Describe the appearance of the residue.<br>

 Weight of NaOH in 25 mL of 2M solution = (25 X 2 X 40 / 1000) g.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2">Measure acidity using a titration kit<br>
 To measure T.A. in wine, use an inexpensive titration or acid test kit.<br> 
 Test kits can be purchased cheaply and can be used over and over again.<br> 
 The amount of acid in must or wine is measured by slowly adding a small 
 amount of the reagent base sodium hydroxide until a change 
 in colour occurs from the indicator phenolphthalein.<br> 
 Put a 15 cc sample (one cc equals one ml) of must or wine into a test-tube.<br> 
 Most test tubes that come with the acid test kits are marked with a line
indicating this volume, or use a small plastic syringe in the test 
 kit to measure the desired amount into the test tube.<br> 
 Then rinse the syringe.<br> 
 Put 3 drops of the phenolphthalein solution into the test-tube.<br> 
 Swirl or shake the test tube to mix the indicator with the must or wine.<br> 
 Use the syringe to draw out 10 cc of the sodium hydroxide reagent, with
no bubbles in the liquid.<br> 
 Be careful! Avoid contact of the sodium hydroxide solution with your skin
or eyes.<br> 
 Add the sodium hydroxide solution to the test-tube, by 0.5 cc at a time.<br> 
 After each addition of 0.5 cc, swirl or shake the test-tube to mix the
contents.<br> 
 The colour of the liquid will momentarily change upon the addition of
the reagent.<br> 
 If testing white wines, the colour change will be pink.<br> 
 If testing red wines, the colour change will be grey.<br> 
 Keep swirling the test-tube until the colour subsides.<br> 
 If the colour of the must or wine returns to the original colour, repeat
adding 0.5 cc until the colour change is permanent.<br> 
 So when the colour, pink or grey, does not go away, stop and record the
amount of reagent used.<br> 
 To determine the acidity of the must or wine, for each cc of reagent used, 
equals 0.1 % TA.<br> 
 For example, if you used 6 cc of sodium hydroxide to react with the must
or wine, the titrarable acidity is 0.6 %.<br> 
 Discard the sample, because it is now toxic.<br> 
 Do not add the sample back into your original must or wine!<br>

 Burettes are large and fragile so spillage and breakage of glassware occur
