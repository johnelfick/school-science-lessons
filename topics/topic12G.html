<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="12.1.1H">12.1.1</a> Iron (II) sulfate with sodium carbonate<br>
 Add sodium carbonate, (washing soda), solution to iron (II) sulfate solution.<br>
 A green precipitate of iron (II) carbonate forms<br>
 iron (II) sulfate + sodium carbonate --> iron (II) carbonate + sodium sulfate<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="12.1.2H">12.1.2</a> Iron (II) sulfate with ammonia<br>
 Add drops of dilute ammonia solution to 2 cm of iron (II) sulfate solution in a test-tube and shake the test-tube.<br>
 Observe a green-grey precipitate of iron (II) hydroxide.<br>
 The precipitate left on the side of the test-tube quickly turns brown, because oxygen from the air turns it into iron (III) hydroxide, ferric hydroxide.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="12.1.3aH">12.1.3a</a> Iron (II) sulfate oxidization to iron (III) sulfate, (ferric sulfate)<br>
 Heat iron (II) sulfate solution with a substance rich in oxygen, e.g. hydrogen peroxide.<br>
 Boil 2 cm of iron (II) sulfate solution in a test-tube with drops of hydrogen peroxide.<br>
 The green colour changes to yellow or brown.<br>
 Cool the test-tube under the tap and test the liquid, iron (III) sulfate solution (ferric sulfate) by adding dilute ammonia solution.<br>
 A brown precipitate of iron (III) hydroxide, (ferric hydroxide) forms.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="12.1.5H">12.1.5</a> Prepare iron (II) sulfate crystals with iron filings<br>
 When iron is treated with dilute sulfuric acid hydrogen gas forms and a solution of iron (II) sulfate (iron (II) sulfate) forms.<br>
 Heat half a test-tube of dilute sulfuric acid over a flame, but do not boil the liquid.<br>
 Remove the test-tube from the flame and add iron filings on the end of a metal spatula.<br>
 A vigorous effervescence occurs, because of the formation of hydrogen.<br>
 Test with a glowing splint.<br>
 When the action dies down, add more iron filings, and then more, until a total of 4 mL is added. Put the test-tube on one side for 15 minutes
 until effervescence has nearly ceased.<br>
 Filter the liquid into an evaporating basin.<br>
 Make sure that acid is left, by testing with blue litmus paper.<br>
 The presence of acid prevents the solution from oxidizing to brown iron (III) sulfate.<br>
 To obtain large crystals of iron (II) sulfate, leave the solution undisturbed for a day or two to crystallize out.<br>
 Small crystals can form more quickly by evaporating the solution over a flame until only one third of it remains.<br>
 If a brown colour appears in the liquid during the evaporation add a drops of dilute sulfuric acid.<br>
 When the evaporation finishes, leave the remaining liquid to cool.<br>
 Many small crystals of iron (II) sulfate are deposited.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="12.1.6H">12.1.6</a> Ammonium iron (III) sulfate, NH4Fe(SO4)2.12H2O, 
iron (III) ammonium sulfate, ferric ammonium sulfate (FAS), iron<br>
 alum, Toxic if ingested<br>
 Ammonium iron (III) sulfate forms violet crystals that dissolve in water 
 to form a brown acid solution.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="12.1.6.1H">12.1.6.1</a> Prepare ammonium iron (III) sulfate solution<br>
 Dissolve 2 mL of the powdered crystals in two thirds of a test-tube of water.<br>
 Be careful! Do not to spill the solution on clothes, because it causes a brown stain of iron mould, followed by rotting of the cloth.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="12.1.7H">12.1.7</a> Prepare iron (III) hydroxide and iron (III) oxide<br>
 Add 4 cm of dilute ammonia solution to 2 cm of ammonium iron (III) sulfate solution in a test-tube.<br>
 Shake the test-tube to mix the liquids.<br>
 A brown jelly-like precipitate of iron (III) hydroxide forms.<br>
 Filter off the precipitate of iron (III) hydroxide.<br>
 Put of the red-brown jelly left in the filter paper on to a clean metal lid or into a metal screw cap.<br>
 Hold the lid or cap in a pair of pliers and heat it carefully above a flame.<br>
 Steam is produced and a red powder formed.<br>
 This is iron (III) oxide, a very pure form of rust.<br>
 The same substance forms by heating iron (II) sulfate crystals.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="12.1.8H">12.1.8</a> Prepare salts by neutralization of sodium hydroxide<br>
 As sodium hydroxide is an alkali it can be used to neutralize an acid.<br>
 The substance resulting from neutralization is a salt.<br>
 Chemical reaction: Alkali + acid --> salt + water
 For this experiment a solution of citric acid, dilute nitric acid, or dilute sulfuric acid can be used.<br>
 The salt obtained is sodium citrate, sodium nitrate, or sodium sulfate.<br>
 The details of the preparation are similar to those described to make ammonium sulfate.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="12.1.10H">12.1.10</a> Sodium hypochlorite bleach<br>
 1. Wet the cork of the bottle of bleaching fluid with the strong solution and touch a piece of red litmus paper.<br>
 The red litmus paper first turns blue and then becomes bleached.<br>
 Put one drop of blue ink in a test-tube then half fill it with water.<br>
 Add one drop of bleaching fluid then shake the test-tube.<br>
 The colour from the ink disappears.<br>
 2. Wet a strip of coloured cotton cloth then squeeze it nearly dry.<br>
 Put the cloth in a beaker then add half a test-tube of the strong bleaching fluid and two test-tubes of water.<br>
 Leave the cloth in the liquid for twenty four hours.<br>
 If by then the colour has not completely disappeared, renew the bleaching solution and put the cloth in it again.<br>
 The cloth is rotted if too strong a bleaching solution is used.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="12.1.11H">12.1.11</a> Butyl chloride rainbow reactions<br>
Butyl chloride, tert-butyl chloride, t-Butyl chloride, 1-chlorobutane, 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, (CH3)3CCl<br>
 1. Make a pH 12 solution by adding 10 drops of 0.1 M NaOH to 100 mL water, in a 250 mL beaker.<br>
 Add universal indicator to produce a distinct colour.<br>
 Start with universal indicator.<br>
 Use a second 250 mL beaker to mix by pouring the solution back and forth between the two beakers or put a magnetic bar into the 
 solution and start the stirrer motor at a fast rate.<br>
 Add 15 drops of t-butyl chloride (2-chloro-2-methylpropane) to the solution and begin mixing.<br>
 Observe any colour changes.<br>
 After 40 seconds add universal indicator and observe any colour changes.<br>
 The full range of colour changes (purple, blue, cyan, emerald-green, lime-green, yellow, orange, orange-red, take about two minutes.<br>
 The changes in the middle are more rapid than the changes at either extreme.<br>
 Use different indicators to show different colour changes and different induction times<br>
 2. Prepare two solutions: 0.1 M 2-chloro-2 methylpropane (t-butyl chloride) in ethanol (1 g per 100 mL) and 0.01 M sodium hydroxide.<br>
 Put 5 mL 0.1 M C4H9Cl in a test-tube.<br>
 In another test-tube put 5 mL 0.1 M NaOH, 10 mL water and two drops of any one of the following indicators.<br>
 Mix the solutions back and forth once and observe for the colour change that occurs after an induction period.<br>
 With equal volumes 0.01 M sodium hydroxide and 0.1 M C4H9Cl the colour changes with universal indicator were: Purple to blue<br>
 (on mixing), blue to green (after 12 seconds), green to yellow (after 15 seconds), yellow to orange (after 25 seconds total).<br>
 Cooling the solutions greatly slows the reaction, increasing the induction period, e.g. with iced water, the methyl red change took more than 50 seconds.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="12.1.13H">12.1.13</a> Prepare sodium hypochlorite<br>
 Prepare sodium chlorate (I) solution with bleaching fluid and sodium carbonate (washing soda).<br>
 Prepare a solution of sodium carbonate, (washing soda), by dissolving 10 mL of the powdered crystals in 100 mL of water in a beaker.<br>
 Leave the solution to cool.<br>
 Put 10 mL of bleaching powder into a beaker and add the cold solution of washing soda while stirring with a glass rod.<br>
 When all the washing soda is added leave the white precipitate to settle.<br>
 Pour off the liquid above the solid then filter it.<br>
 The filtrate is a solution of sodium chloride and sodium hypochlorite.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="12.1.14H">12.1.14</a> Prepare sodium hydroxide<br>
 The double decomposition reaction: sodium carbonate + calcium hydroxide --> sodium hydroxide + calcium carbonate (precipitate)<br>
 1. Make a concentrated sodium carbonate solution and add to it calcium hydroxide solution.<br>
 Shake well for three minutes.<br>
 A white precipitate forms.<br>
 Filter into a clean bottle and label it.<br>
 This double decomposition reaction between solutions of sodium carbonate and calcium hydroxide occurs, because one of the products, 
calcium carbonate, is insoluble.<br>
 The filtrate is sodium hydroxide solution.<br>
 Test the sodium hydroxide solution with universal indicator paper.<br>
 The universal indicator paper turns blue or violet. 
 2. Fill a beaker half full of water and heat it on a gauze and tripod until the water boils.<br>
 Add 15 mL of powdered sodium carbonate (washing soda) and stir with a glass rod, until it has dissolved.<br>
 Add 7 mL calcium hydroxide (slaked lime) crystals and continue the boiling.<br>
 After five minutes, filter drops of the hot liquid into a test-tube, then test the filtrate by adding drops of an acid solution.<br>
 If no effervescence occurs, the reaction is complete.<br>
 If effervescence occurs, add another 5 mL of calcium hydroxide to the beaker and continue the boiling for another five minutes.<br>
 Tests the filtrate again by adding drops of an acid solution.<br>
 When the testing shows no sodium carbonate in the filtrate leave the beaker to cool so that a white residue of chalk settles on the bottom of the beaker.<br>
 When the beaker is cool, pour off the clear solution of sodium hydroxide into a stock bottle, but do not filter it.<br>
 Add an equal amount of water to this strong solution, which could be used for other experiments.<br>
 3. Dissolve sodium oxide in water to form soluble sodium hydroxide.<br>

 Add 15 mL of powdered sodium carbonate (washing soda) and stir with a glass rod until it has dissolved.<br>
 Add 7 mL calcium hydroxide (slaked lime) crystals and continue the boiling.<br>
 After five minutes, filter drops of the hot liquid into a test-tube then test the filtrate by adding drops of an acid solution.<br>
 If no effervescence occurs, the reaction is complete.<br>
 If effervescence occurs, add another 5 mL of calcium hydroxide to the beaker and continue the boiling for another five minutes.<br>
 Tests the filtrate again by adding drops of an acid solution.<br>
 When the testing shows no sodium carbonate in the filtrate leave the beaker to cool so that a white residue of chalk settles on the bottom of the beaker.<br>
 When the beaker is cool, pour off the clear solution of sodium hydroxide into a stock bottle, but do not filter it.<br>
 Add an equal amount of water to this strong solution, which could then be used for other experiments.<br>
 Double decomposition reaction:<br>
 calcium hydroxide + sodium carbonate --> calcium carbonate + sodium hydroxide.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="12.1.15H">12.1.15</a> Test the soapy feel of sodium hydroxide<br>
 Moisten the tip of a finger with a drop of dilute sodium hydroxide solution and rub the fingers together.<br>
 The soapy feel is a typical property of strong alkalis.<br>
 Wash the fingers immediately after the test.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="12.1.16H">12.1.16</a> Prepare sodium nitrate crystals by neutralization<br>
 Put half a test-tube of dilute nitric acid into an evaporating basin and add a small piece of red litmus paper.<br>
 Add dilute sodium carbonate or sodium hydroxide solution, a drop or two at a time.<br>
 Stir the solution after each addition.<br>
 Continue adding the solution and stirring until the litmus paper turns blue.<br>
 Remove the litmus paper and heat the evaporating basin gently to boil away about two thirds of the liquid before leaving it to stand.<br>
 White crystals of the salt sodium nitrate form.<br>
 Acid + base --> salt + water.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="12.1.17H">12.1.17</a> Heat sodium bicarbonate<br>
 Sodium bicarbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate, "bicarb", "baking soda", bicarbonate of soda, nahalite, NaHCO3<br>
 Put 5 g of sodium bicarbonate into a dry test-tube 1.<br>
 Put 2 cm of clear lime water in test-tube 2.<br>
 Hold test-tube 1 in a paper holder in the left hand so that the test-tube slopes down.<br>
 Hold test-tube 2 in the other hand so that the two test-tubes are mouth to mouth.<br>
 Heat test-tube 1 over a very flame.<br>
 Observe the moisture depositing on the cooler part of the test-tube.<br>
 After heating for a few minutes shake up the lime water in test-tube 2.<br>
 The lime water turns milky, showing that carbon dioxide is being produced.<br>
 Chemical action: sodium bicarbonate + heat --> sodium carbonate + water + carbon dioxide<br>
 2NaHCO3 (s) --> CO2 (g) + Na2CO3 (s) + H2O (g)<br>
 Na2CO3 (s) --> CO2 (g) + Na2O (s)<br>

 Any acid solution causes carbon dioxide to be formed sodium bicarbonate.<br>
 Put a 5 mL of baking soda in a test-tube and add vinegar or any other dilute acid.<br>
 Dip a lighted taper into the test-tube and it is extinguished by the carbon dioxide formed.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="12.1.19H">12.1.19</a> Sodium bicarbonate precipitates<br>
 A solution of sodium bicarbonate forms precipitates with metal salts.<br>
 These precipitates are not bicarbonates, but are the ordinary carbonates of the metals.<br>
 Put 2 cm of baking soda solution into a test-tubes and adding drops of the following solutions: copper sulfate, iron (II) sulfate, 
 magnesium sulfate, zinc sulfate.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="12.1.21H">12.1.21</a> Sodium bicarbonate prevents milk from going sour<br>
 In hot weather, milk may turn sour, because bacteria change the milk sugar into lactic acid.<br>
 So milk that is beginning to go off can be saved by adding sodium bicarbonate solution to it.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="12.1.22H">12.1.22</a> Prepare sodium carbonate with baking soda<br>
 Sodium bicarbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate, "bicarb", "baking soda", bicarbonate of soda, nahalite, NaHCO3<br>
 Put 10 g of baking soda crystals in a beaker about one third full of water.<br>
 Stir the powder round then pour off a few drops of the liquid into a test-tube and test it with phenolphthalein.<br>
 Sodium bicarbonate solution is too weak an alkali to give the usual red colour with this indicator.<br>
 Heat the beaker on a gauze and tripod and keep the liquid gently boiling for ten minutes.<br>
 The sodium bicarbonate crystals soon disappear, because they decompose into the more soluble sodium carbonate, water, and carbon dioxide.<br>
 Let the beaker stand to cool.<br>
 Tests drops of the liquid again with a drop of phenolphthalein.<br>
 A rose red colour forms showing that sodium carbonate is a stronger alkali than sodium bicarbonate.<br>
 Colourless crystals of sodium carbonate may deposit in the beaker when cold.<br>
 Alternatively, transfer the solution to an evaporating basin to heat the solution and increase the concentration, then leave to cool.<br>

 Put large, clear crystal of sodium carbonate on a watch glass and leave it for an hour.<br>
 It forms a white powdery coating that can easily be scraped off with a knife.<br>
 This change, called "efflorescence", is caused by the crystal losing its water.<br>
 The white powder has the chemical formula Na2CO3.H2O, and can be called sodium carbonate monohydrate.<br>

 Heat a crystal of sodium carbonate, gently on a metal lid.<br>
 The crystal soon melts.<br>
 Continue heating to form clouds of steam.<br>
 The liquid dries up and a white powder remains.<br>
 The anhydrous sodium carbonate, known commercially as soda ash, has lost all of its water of crystallization.<br>

 1. Bath salts crystals may be added to bath water to "soften" it.<br>
 Sodium carbonate, (washing soda), crystals coloured by dyes may be sold as a cheap form of bath salts.<br>
 When these bath salts are exposed to the air, they betray their identity by forming a white coating, because of efflorescence.<br>
 2. Sodium sesquicarbonate (trisodium hydrogen carbonate), Na3H(CO3)2, is a double salt of sodium bicarbonate and sodium carbonate that naturally
 occurs as Na2CO3.NaHCO3.2H2O, the dihydrate evaporate mineral trona found in evaporation pools.<br>
 Better quality bath salts containing of crystals of sodium sesquicarbonate are not so alkaline as washing soda bath salts and are kinder to the skin.<br>
 These bath salts are manufactured by combining sodium carbonate and baking soda together, with colouring matter and perfume.<br>
 To make bath salt crystals, dissolve 5 g of baking soda in a beaker of hot water.<br>
 When the baking soda has dissolved, add four times as much powdered sodium carbonate and stir to dissolve all the powder.<br>
 Transfer the solution to an evaporating basin and leave in a hot place until needle-like crystals form.<br>
 Unlike washing soda, these crystals are not efflorescent.<br>
 Sodium sesquicarbonate can also be used as a water softener and to remove copper chloride verdigris from old copper vessels.<br>

 2. Lactic acid, CH3-CHOH-COOH, forms in milk due to the action of fungi and bacteria acting on the lactose sugar, especially the Lactobacillus bacteria.<br>
 The presence of lactic acid, produced during the lactic acid fermentation is responsible for the sour taste and for the improved microbiological stability
 and safety of the food.<br>
 Investigate the factors influencing the rate of formation of lactic acid with starter bacteria, e.g. plain yoghurt.<br>
 The possible factors include heat, amount of bacteria added, light, access to air, shape of container, sugar concentration, initial pH, amount of fat
 (normal, low fat, skim), degree of agitation..<br>
3. Acidity of fresh milk may be measured by titration with a 0.1 M NaOH solution, and shows the reaction with NaOH up to a phenolphthalein end point.<br>
 Fresh milk contains almost no lactic acid and the reaction with NaOH is used to change the pH of carbon dioxide, citrates, casein, albumin and phosphates.<br>
 This indicates lactic acid concentration about 0.13% of the determination of "acidity" in fresh milk by means of titration with NaOH is a measure of the buffer
 action of milk, so it can be called the "initial acidity".<br>
 The "titratable" acidity of fresh milk is not due to lactic acid only.<br>
 The acidity, which is the result of bacterial activity producing lactic acid during milk collection, transportation, and processing can be 
 called the "developed acidity".<br>
 Measure "titratable acidity" (not calling it "lactic acid concentration", subtract the initial "acidity" to get a value for the "developed acidity".<br>
 An example, for the titratable acidity of milk:<br>
 Day 1: = 0.0288M, (7.10 mL titre), initial acidity<br>
 Day 7 = 0.0815M, (15.65 mL titre), titratable acidity<br>
 4. Milk fermentation experiments<br>
 4.1 Temperature is the independent variable, e.g. 0 oC, 10 oC, 
 20 oC, 30 oC.<br>
 Titratable acidity is the dependent variable.<br>
 If measurement is done only after 1 week, "time" is a controlled variable, as are variables initial pH, sunlight, sugar concentration, aeration, exposed surface area.<br>
 So prepare a one line graph plotting "titratable acidity" on the y-axis and temperature on the x-axis.<br>
4.2 Time is the independent variable.<br>
 Temperature remains as an independent variable, but measurement of titratable acidity is done every week at 0, 1, 2 and 3 weeks.<br>
 So, if using four different temperatures, prepare a four line graph plotting of titratable acidity on the y-axis and time on the x-axis to 
 show the fermentation rate at each temperature.<br>

 Boil a 2 mL of starch with half a test-tube of dilute sulfuric acid or sodium hydrogen sulfate, (sodium bisulfate), solution for two minutes.<br>
 Then pour off drops of the liquid into another test-tube, cool it under the tap, and test it by adding a drop of iodine solution.<br>
 The liquid turns red.<br>
 The starch has been changed into dextrin, a substance, which, like starch, is given the same formula.<br>
 In this case, however, z (number of amylose units) is supposed to be a much smaller number than for starch.<br>
 Continue boiling the remainder of the liquid for another three minutes to convert the dextrin into glucose.<br>
 To show that glucose has been formed, cool the liquid and<br>
 neutralize it in an evaporating basin with dilute sodium carbonate or sodium hydroxide solution (test with litmus paper).<br>
 Add 2 cm of the neutralized solution to a precipitate of copper hydroxide made from solutions of copper sulfate and sodium hydroxide.<br>
 If the test-tube is warmed, a yellow precipitate, which turns red, of cuprous oxide forms.<br>

 Fermentation is a chemical reaction caused by lowly forms of life, such as bacteria and moulds.<br>
 We have already seen an example of this in the turning sour of milk.<br>
 Baker's yeast is a simple form of plant life, which, under suitable conditions, is able to turn sugar (and starch) into alcohol and carbon dioxide.<br>
 In bread making, it is the carbon dioxide gas that puffs up the dough and makes the bread light.<br>
Experiment<br>
 Dissolve 5 mL of sugar in a beaker of water and put the solution into a flask that is fitted with a delivery tube dipping into lime water.<br>
 Add 5 mL of baker's yeast and leave the apparatus in a hot place, such as a shelf of the airing cupboard.<br>
 In an hour or two the contents of the flask begins to froth and the lime water turn milky, showing that carbon dioxide is being produced.<br>
 If the flask is left for two or three days and the contents are then filtered, alcohol can form from the filtrate by distillation.<br>
 It is illegal to distil alcohol, and an offender is liable to a long term of imprisonment, besides having his apparatus confiscated! when the 
 distillation is done in a laboratory the first few drops of the liquid formed by distillation burn with a blue flame, that is characteristic of alcohol.<br>

 It is most unusual for a solid substance to evaporate away when left out in the air.<br>
 This, however, happens with naphthalene.<br>
 Leave one or two naphthalene mothballs on a watch glass or saucer outside in the open air.<br>
 Examine the mothballs some days later and note that they are smaller, because of evaporation.<br>

 Heat the water until it begins to boil and then remove the saucepan from the flame.<br>
 After a few minutes, beautiful starry crystals are deposited on the sides of the beaker and funnel.<br>
 Remove the funnel and blow it gently, to make the crystals float off into the air and glisten brightly as they slowly fall.<br>
 Instead of a funnel use a glass plate over the jar.<br>
 In this experiment, the mothballs do not melt, but change straight into vapour that condenses again on the cooler part of the beaker and funnel.<br>
 This change is called sublimation.<br>
 It is similar to the subliming of ammonium chloride.<br>
 On a hot summer day, mothballs can be made to sublime merely by leaving them in a beaker on a window sill where sunlight falls on the jar.<br>
 Starry crystals again form.<br>

 1. In 1773, Antoine Lavoisier, (1743-1794, France), reported that when copper transformed into verdigris, the substance gained in weight.<br>
 This observation lead to the conclusion that "something" was being taken from the air.<br>
 In 1777, after further experiments, he named the "something" as the gas oxygen, "generator of acid".<br>
 2. Verdigris has no simple formula, but it is usually mostly basic copper carbonate, CuCO3CH(OH)2, as seen in the green colour of old 
 coins from copper exposed to moist air.<br>
 It is harmful if ingested.<br>
 In moist sea air, copper chlorides may form.<br>
 The verdigris on bronze is called aerugo.<br>
 3. The green to green-blue pigment copper acetate used in old oil paintings is also called verdigris.<br>
 4. Put a piece of copper coin in a watch glass or saucer and pour drops of vinegar on to the surface of the copper.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2H"><a name="18.7.2.2.2H">18.7.2.2.2</a> Sodium hypochlorite<br>
 Sodium hypochlorite, NaOCl, is the liquid chlorine used in swimming pools.<br>
 It usually provides 12% to 15% available chlorine and has a pH of 13.<br>
 It is generally cheap, but difficult and dangerous to handle.<br>
 It also loses its potency rapidly and is usually only used in large commercial swimming pools.<br>
 Sodium hypochlorite is stable in alkaline aqueous solutions and is readily available as 5% solution "laundry bleach", e.g. "Chlorox",
 and as 12-15% available chlorine solution, often called "liquid bleach", from pool supply stores.<br>
 Sodium hypochlorite, with a pH of 13 is relatively low in available chlorine concentration so more is required to maintain the 
 disinfectant residual in a swimming pool.<br>
 The liquid form is bulky and it has poor storage stability, so it must be purchased frequently throughout the swimming pool season.<br>
 Although it does not add hardness to the swimming pool, its high pH can contribute to scaling tendencies in hard water areas.<br>
 It is generally cheap, but difficult and dangerous to handle.<br>
 It also loses its potency rapidly and is usually only used in large commercial swimming pools.<br>
 NaOCl + H2O --> Na+ + OCl- + H2O<br>
 sodium hypochlorite + water -->  sodium ion + hypochlorite ion + water<br>
 When dissolved, equilibrium is established between the strong oxidant HClO and the weaker ClO- ion.<br>
 HOCl + H2O --> OCl- + H3O+ (Ka = 3 × 10-8)<br>
 hypochlorous acid + water --> hypochlorite ion + hydronium ion<br>
 HOCl is much more effective in oxidizing the cell contents of bacteria, because the negative charge on OCR- may prevent passage through bacterial walls.<br>
 At about pH 6 almost all free chlorine is converted to HOCl.<br>
 At pH &lt; 2, chlorine gas forms to corrode metals and pool tile grouting<br>
 CaSO4 (s) --> Ca2+ (aq) + SO42- (aq)<br>
 calcium sulfate (in Portland cement) --> calcium ion + sulfate ion<br>
 SO42- (aq) + H+ (aq) --> HSO4- (aq)<br>
 sulfate ion + hydrogen ion --> hydrogen sulfate ion<br>
 However, this can be minimized by adding calcium ions as calcium chloride, (CaCl2), to the pool water that shift the equilibrium to the 
 left, i.e. back to solid calcium sulfate, CaSO4.<br>
 Both forms have a high pH, and may require frequent additions of acid to maintain swimming pool water in the proper pH range for 
 chlorine sanitizing efficiency, equipment longevity and swimmer comfort.<br>
 The hypochlorite ions also establish equilibrium with hydrogen ions, depending on the pH.<br>
 The same relative amounts of HOCl and OCl- exist at equilibrium at a given pH if either chlorine gas or hypochlorites are used.<br>
 Chlorine decreases the initial pH, and hypochlorites increase the initial pH.<br>
 Neither product provides protection against the destructive effects of sunlight on a chlorine residual, so frequent chemical additions and 
 adjustments are necessary to maintain satisfactory water quality in outdoor swimming pools.<br>
