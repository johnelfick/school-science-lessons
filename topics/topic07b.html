<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="1.0.0H">1.0.0</a> Matter<br>
 Matter is composed of atoms, which, in turn, contain protons and neutrons in a nucleus, and electrons outside the nucleus.<br>
 The number of positively charged protons is equal to the number of negatively charged electrons in a neutral atom, and determines all the chemical properties of an atom.<br>
 Materials may be elements, compounds or mixtures.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="1.1.0H">1.1.0</a> Micronization<br>
 Size reduction mills are used in the pharmaceutical industry to increase surface area, improve formulation dissolution and maintain a consistent average particle size distribution for tablets and capsules.<br>
 Impact size reduction is usually by mechanical impact and impact via fluid energy using hammer mills and liquidized bed jet mills.<br>
 Micronization that uses supercritical fluids to cause the small diameter of the solid particles by the supersaturation at the time of the particle formation, includes the following:<br>
* RESS process (Rapid Expansion of Supercritical Solutions), where the solution is expanded through a nozzle,<br>
* SAS method (Supercritical Anti-Solvent), where the material precipitates out of the solution as a solid with a very small particle diameter,<br>
* PGSS method (Particles from Gas Saturated Solutions), where the solid is melted and the supercritical fluid is dissolved in it as in the SAS method, but the solution is forced to expand through a nozzle.<br>
The PGSS method is used for pharmaceuticals and foodstuffs.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="2.0.0H">2.0.0</a> Elements<br>
 Elements cannot be broken down into simpler substances by a chemical change.<br>
 An element is a substance in which all atoms have the same number of protons.<br>
 Atoms of an element may contain different numbers of neutrons, and are known as isotopes.<br>
 Every element is assigned a unique chemical symbol.<br>
 At room temperature and atmospheric pressure, eleven elements are gases: H2, He, N2, O2, F2, Ne, Cl2, Ar, Kr, Xe, Rn.<br>
 Two elements are liquids at room temperature: Hg and Br.<br>
 Reactive elements have atoms weakly bound together and have electrons available for bonding, e.g. F.<br>
 Unreactive elements have atoms joined by strong bonds, e.g. diamond.<br>
 Elements that exist as separate small molecules have low boiling points and melting points, e.g. He, O2.<br>
Experiment<br>
 Describe each example.<br>
1. Note the state of matter at room temperature, solid, liquid or gas.<br>
2. Note whether the solid has a shiny surface or has a lustre when the surface is clean.<br>
3. Note whether the metal can be bent or twisted with pliers, or whether it fractures.<br>
4. Note whether the element conducts electricity when held between two alligator clips as electrical contacts.<br>
5. Put a piece of the element on a combustion spoon and set it alight with a burner flame.<br>
Observe the burning element.<br>
6. Shake the products of the combustion in a test-tube containing water.<br>
Test the solution with moist litmus paper.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="8.2.17H">8.2.17</a> Elements combine with oxygen gas when heated in air<br>
 1. Put a small quantity of sulfur on a deflagrating spoon and set it alight with a Bunsen burner flame.<br>
 Note the appearance of the burning sulfur and then lower it into a test-tube containing oxygen gas.<br>
 Be careful!<br>
 The sulfur dioxide produced has a very irritating odour and may cause distress to people with asthma.<br>
 When you heat sulfur, it melts, turns brown, and burns with a blue flame.<br>
 It burns more vigorously in oxygen gas than in air.<br>
 During the burning it combines with oxygen gas to form the compound sulfur dioxide:<br>
 sulfur (s) + oxygen (g) --> sulfur dioxide (g)<br>
 2. Repeat the experiment using the following:<br>
 * Iron (steel wool),<br>
 * Magnesium.<br>
 <b>Be careful!</b><br>
 Do not look at the burning magnesium!<br>
 The light may injure the eyes!<br>
 * Carbon.<br>
 In each case, note whether the substance burns more rapidly in oxygen gas than in air.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.0.0H">3.0.0</a> Atoms<br>
 Atom is the smallest division of an element that can chemically exist alone and have the characteristics of the element.<br>
 Atomic mass (atomic weight), of an atom is arbitrarily defined relative to the mass of the isotope carbon.<br>
 The relative atomic mass of an element is the ratio of average mass of atoms of the element to 1 / 12 of the mass of one atom of the isotope C-12.<br>
 Atomic mass unit (a.m.u.), is a unit of mass used to express the relative atomic mass.<br>
 So 1 atomic mass unit = 1 / 12 of the mass of the carbon-12 isotope, i.e. 1.66 × 10<sup>-27</sup> kg.<br>
 The mass of 1 atom of oxygen = 16 a.m.u.<br>
 The atomic theory dates from the 5th century B.C. when Greek philosophers, e.g. Democritus, said that matter consists of indivisible indestructible particles.<br>
 The modern atomic theory started with the hypothetical thinking of John Dalton, England (1766 - 1844).<br>
 However, he did not envisage the structure of atoms, i.e. nucleus, electrons and other particles.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.0.0H">4.0.0</a> Molecules<br>
 Molecules have two or more atoms joined chemically to form the simplest stable structure of that element or compound.<br>
 So a hydrogen molecule must contain 2 atoms, H2, because the hydrogen atom, H, cannot exist by itself.<br>
 A molecule of water, H2O, contains 2 atoms of hydrogen, H, and 1 atom of oxygen, O.<br>
 Molecular formula represents the number of atoms of each element in the molecule.<br>
 The molecular formula of water is H2O, so water contains two H atoms and one O atom.<br>
 The empirical formula of a compound shows the ratio of elements present in the compound.<br>
 Glucose has a molecular formula of C6H12O6, so it contains 2 moles of hydrogen for every mole of carbon and oxygen.<br>
 The empirical formula for glucose is C6H12O6/6 = CH2O.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.0.0H">5.0.0</a> Ions<br>
 Ions form when an atom or group of atoms covalently bound together may gain or lose one or more electrons.<br>
 Ionic bonding occurs when positive and negative ions are held together in a crystal lattice by electrostatic forces.<br>
 The structure of metals involves positive ions embedded in a sea of electrons.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.0.0H">7.0.0</a> Chemical compounds<br>
 1. Compounds are composed of two or more elements that are chemically united in fixed proportion.<br>
 Compounds can be broken down to simple substances.<br>
 Chemical compounds form when chemical bonds, whether ionic or covalent, are formed between different elements.<br>
 A chemical compound can be represented by a chemical formula.<br>
 Forces weaker than covalent bonding exist between molecules.<br>
 In compounds containing carbon-hydrogen bonds, organic compounds, the carbon atoms bind to one another through single, double or triple covalent bonds to form chains or rings.<br>
 Observe samples of iron, carbon, copper, magnesium, mercury in a thermometer and solid sticks of sulfur.<br>
 2. Classify each compound according to the following characteristics:<br>
 * Is it a hard solid, a liquid or a gas at room temperature?<br>
 * If the element is a solid, does it shine and have a lustre?<br>
 If necessary, scratch its surface.<br>
 * Can the element be bent or twisted or does it fracture easily?
 You may require pliers to do this.<br>
 * Will the element conduct electricity?<br>
 Place the element between two electrical contacts in a circuit.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.1.6.1 H">7.1.6.1 </a> Chemical changes and physical changes<br>
 1. In a chemical change, one or more substances changes into one or more new substances, e.g. hydrogen gas combines with oxygen gas to form water.<br>
 In this document the expression used is as follows: "hydrogen gas with oxygen gas forms water".<br>
 The new substances, the products, have properties different from the original substances, the reactants.<br>
 For example burning wood forms black ash containing carbon, white ash containing mineral salts, carbon dioxide gas and water vapour.<br>
 New substances form and the change cannot be reversed.<br>
 The arrow symbol " -->" represents this type of change.<br>
 2H2 (g) + O2 (g) --> 2H2O (l).<br>
 2. In a physical change, the properties: of a substance change, but the substance is still the same.<br>
 The change can be reversed.<br>
 The physical properties: of water change when water freezes to ice.<br>
 However, the ice is composed of water molecules and the change can be reversed.<br>
 When electricity passes through a tungsten filament in a light bulb, the filament becomes hot and emits light.<br>
 It is still tungsten.<br>
 When you turn off the light, the tungsten filament is the same as before.<br>
 Physical or chemical changes may be fast or slow, e.g. hammering iron, wearing away rock by wind erosion, an explosion when hydrogen gas burns, rusting of iron.<br>
3. Classify common examples of changes into chemical change or physical change.<br>
 Do the following activities and in each case say whether it is a chemical or physical change:<br>
 1. Light a match (chemical change).<br>
 2. Turn on the light (physical change).<br>
 3. Let a nail rust (chemical change takes place in air causing a gain in weight).<br>
 4. Chew food (physical change for biting and masticating, and chemical change for the reactions of starch with salivary amylase).<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.1.6.4H">7.1.6.4</a> Burn magnesium and weigh the products<br>
 Put a piece of magnesium ribbon in a crucible.<br>
 Weigh the crucible and lid and magnesium ribbon.<br>
 Burn the magnesium in the nearly closed crucible so that the ash is not lost.<br>
 Weigh the crucible and lid and ash.<br>
 The weight of the ash is greater than the weight of the magnesium.<br>
 The reaction forms a new substance, magnesium oxide.<br>
 Mg, density 1.74 g / cm<sup>3</sup> oxidizes to MgO, density 3.58 g / cm<sup>3</sup>, so when oxygen attaches to magnesium the volume decreases, because of the strength of the (Mg<sup>2+</sup>-- O<sup>2-</sup>) bond.<br>
 2Mg (s) + O2 (g) --> 2MgO (s).<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.1.6.5H">7.1.6.5</a> Burn steel wool and weigh the products<br>
 Cover the end of a wooden ruler with aluminium foil then note where the ruler balances as a first order lever, see-saw, over a fulcrum.<br>
 Put the ruler balance on a sink bench.<br>
 Put 5 g loose steel wool on the aluminium foil end of the ruler then put a weight on the other end of the ruler so that this end is just down.<br>
 Heat the steel wool with a Bunsen burner flame.<br>
 The steel wool glows and its side of the balance moves down as the iron becomes iron oxide.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.1.6.6H">7.1.6.6</a> Empirical formula of magnesium oxide<br>
Method 1.<br>
To obtain useful data when burning magnesium, problems may occur with igniting the Mg, keeping the Mg burning and recording very little or no mass gain.<br>
Using only 3 cm is not enough so coil it up and use about 25cm in a crucible over a Bunsen burner to obtain reasonable results.<br>
Use sandpaper on the magnesium before experimenting tp remove the oxide layer, then place the magnesium in the crucible, leaving the lid open until it was just about to react.<br>
Make sure that as much of as possible of the coiled longer piece is in contact with the crucible.<br>
Leave the lid off until it ignites, then, while still heating, keep raising the crucible lid with tongs to let in more oxygen, without releasing too much ash. until the reaction appears complete.<br>
Method 2.<br>
Weigh magnesium then heat it in a crucible so that it reacts with oxygen to produce magnesium oxide.<br>
There has been an increase in mass.<br>
Use the results can be used to find the formula of magnesium oxide.<br>
Procedure<br>
If the magnesium ribbon looks tarnished or black, clean it with sand paper.<br>
1. Cut a piece of magnesium ribbon about 10cm long and twist it into a loose coil.<br>
2. Weigh the crucible with the lid and then weigh the magnesium inside the crucible with the lid.<br>
3. Set up the Bunsen burner on the heat resistant mat with the tripod.<br>
Place a pipe clay triangle over the tripod.<br>
Place the crucible containing the magnesium in the pipe clay triangle and put the lid on at an angle so air can still get into the crucible.<br>
4. Light the Bunsen burner and begin to heat the crucible.<br>
Start with a gentle blue flame, but you will need to use a roaring flame, with the air hole fully open, to get the reaction.<br>
5. When the crucible is hot, gently lift the lid with the tongs a little to allow some oxygen to get in.<br>
The magnesium may begin to flare up.<br>
Do not lift the lid is off for too long, because the magnesium oxide product will begin to escape from the crucible.<br>.
Repeat this procedure until you see no further reaction.<br>
6. Turn off the Bunsen burner, allow the apparatus to cool, then re-weigh the crucible with lid containing the product.<br>
7. Heat the crucible again for a couple of minutes, allow to cool, and repeat this step until the mass readings are consistent.<br>
This procedure is called ""heating to constant mass".<br>
2Mg + O2 --> 2MgO<br>
Magnesium + oxygen --> magnesium oxide<br>
To find the formula of magnesium oxide, divide mass by the atomic mass for each element, to give the number of moles of each.<br>
The relative atomic mass of magnesium is 24 and for oxygen is 16.<br>
Find the ratio between the two by dividing them both by the smallest number.<br>
The ratio should be close to 1:1, because the formula of magnesium oxide is MgO.<br>
Example calculation<br>
Mass magnesium = 2.39 g, Mass magnesium oxide = 3.78 g, So mass oxygen = 1.39 g<br>
Number moles Mg = 2.39/24 = 0.0995<br>
Number moles O = 1.39/16 = 0.0868<br>
Divide by the smallest to give the ratio approx. 1 Mg: 1O.<br>
This result suggests a formula of MgO, which is the correct formula.<br>
One teacher got students to all do different lengths, and them plot moles of Mg on X axis and moles of O on Y axis (by subtraction and processing) and tried to get a gradient of 1.<br>
Possible errors include the following:<br>
* the magnesium oxide product may escape as students lift the lid,<br>
* not all the magnesium may have reacted, because the product may still look a bit grey rather than white,<br>
* students may have prodded the product with their splint, so not all of it got weighed,<br>
* the balanced was not tared correctly for one of the weighings,<br>
* the magnesium was coiled too tightly so that not all of it reacted,<br>
* the tripods not at the correct height so that the hottest part of the flame not exactly where the crucible is sitting in the clay triangle,<br>
* some Bunsen burners produce much hotter flames than others, so find one that produce a good flame or use two Bunsen burners if the gas turrets, have two taps, to put two burners on with it,<br>
* if start seeing puffs of whitish “smoke coming out, MgO is being lost,<br>
* students stopped heating before all of the magnesium was powdered ash.<br>
* students failed to record the mass of the empty crucible,<br>
* students could only obtain an around 70% yield.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.1.6.7H">7.1.6.7</a> Chemical changes, heat organic substances<br>
 1. Often one product is black, because carbon forms.<br>
 Heat the following substances in a hard glass or Pyrex test-tube.<br>
 Observe any decomposition of the substances.<br>
 When smoke appears, leave the test-tube to cool.<br>
 No chemical change occurs when you heat charcoal.<br>
 For the following substances, a chemical change occurs and the residue in the test-tube is carbon:<br>
 Experiments<br>
 1. Heat wood or saw dust, and note the brown substances that stick to the sides of the test-tube and the black substance that remain in the bottom.<br>
 2. Heat the following substances, sugar, bread, fruit, fat or oil, starch, potato,rice, paper, wool, hair, nail clippings, meat.<br>
 Heat the tube gently then more strongly.<br>
 The wood decomposes into a black solid and brown liquids and vapours.<br>
 Stop heating when you see no more dense smoke.<br>
 Let the test-tube and observe the substances on the sides of the test-tube.<br>
 Put any remaining solid substance in another clean test-tube.<br>
 Heat it gently and then more strongly.<br>
 You produce no further liquids or gases from this substance.<br>
 Compare the black substance with a sample of the original wood for colour and can be bent.<br>
 Place the end of each in a Bunsen flame for a few seconds.<br>
 Remove and observe them.<br>
 The black substance does not decompose or burn with a flame but, glows red hot.<br>
 The black substance is charcoal, i.e. carbon.<br>
 3. Heat small quantities of sugar, paper, wool, meat and compare the residue in the test-tubes with the original substance.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.1.6.8H">7.1.6.8</a> Chemical changes, heat metals in chlorine<br>
 Be Careful! Chlorine is poisonous.<br>
 These experiment may not be allowed on your school system.<br>
 Do the experiments in a fume cupboard.<br>
 Experiments<br>
 1. Use tongs to heat steel wool in a Bunsen burner flame, then place it in a test-tube containing chlorine gas.<br>
 Observe whether any heat is given out during the reaction.<br>
 Iron and chlorine react together to form a brown yellow iron chloride.<br>
 2. Using a wire gauze, scrape some powdered antimony from a lump of the element so that it falls into a test-tube of chlorine.<br>
 The sparks and burning show that a chemical change is taking place.<br>
 The new white substance is antimony chloride.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.1.6.9H">7.1.6.9</a> Physical changes, magnetize and demagnetize iron wire<br>
 When physical changes occur, no new substance forms.<br>
 Pull a thick iron wire (fencing wire), through iron filings.<br>
 The iron does not attract the iron filings.<br>
 Magnetize the iron by stroking it with a bar magnet.<br>
 Hold the iron wire in the iron filings.<br>

<a href="../images/12.18.1.gif">See diagram 12.18.1</a>: Sulfur crystals.<br>
 1. Sulfur is a non-metallic element that occurs in several allotropic forms.<br>
 Allotropes are variations of the same element with bonding and crystal structure.<br>
 2. Sulfur occurs in three forms:<br>
 Form 1: Rhombic sulfur is a light yellow powder.<br>
 At 100<sup>o</sup>C, it changes to:<br>
 Form 2: Monoclinic sulfur with a deeper colour.<br>
 The monoclinic and rhombic forms differ in the arrangement of the S8 molecules.<br>
 At 160<sup>o</sup>C, sulfur melts to form a sticky dark brown liquid that can be cooled quickly to form red brown plastic sulfur.<br>
 Form 3: Plastic sulfur contains long chains of S atoms.<br>
 Experiments<br>
 Put sulfur powder in a test-tube.<br>
 Heat the sulfur extremely gently until it slowly melts to a golden yellow liquid.<br>
 Continue to heat more strongly until a red gas appears above the liquid.<br>
 Leave the test-tube to cool.<br>
 Sulfur forms deposits on the sides of the tube and in the bottom of the tube.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.1.5.1H">7.1.5.1</a> Prepare monoclinic sulfur from powdered sulfur (flowers of sulfur)<br>
 Monoclinic sulfur has a deep yellow colour, m.p. = 119<sup>o</sup>C, and density = 1.96.<br>
 Heat powdered sulfur extremely gently in an evaporating dish.<br>
 The sulfur changes to liquid.<br>
 Add more powdered sulfur.<br>
 The colour should stay pale yellow.<br>
 If the sulfur turns dark, you have overheated it.<br>
 Repeat the experiment with gentler heating.<br>
 Leave the sulfur to cool, without moving the evaporating dish.<br>
 Monoclinic crystals form between 96<sup>o</sup>C and 114<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 After a thin crust forms, punch two holes through the crust with a nail.<br>
 Pour out the hot sulfur through one hole.<br>
 Remove the crust and note the monoclinic sulfur crystals on the underside.<br>

 The liquid is lemon yellow.<br>
 Pour the liquid sulfur into a folded filter paper.<br>
 A crust forms on the surface.<br>
 When the crust forms, open the filter paper.<br>
 Needle-shaped crystals remain on the filter paper.<br>

 When heated to the melting point, sulfur usually ignites and forms sulfur dioxide gas that may distress people suffering from asthma.<br>
 Rhombic sulfur is a yellow powder, m.p. = 119<sup>o</sup>C, and density = 1.96.<br>
 Experiment<br>
 Put roll sulfur in a test-tube and heat the test-tube slowly.<br>
 Note the changes at the melting point from a light yellow colour to a red liquid.<br>
 The red brown sulfur becomes viscous and it does not flow out if you hold the test-tube upside down.<br>
 Continue heating until the reaction forms a brown black liquid.<br>
 Continue to heat until the sulfur boils at 445<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 <b>BE CAREFUL!</b><br>
 Pour the melted sulfur into a beaker of cold water.<br>
 The reaction forms strands of amorphous sulfur.<br>
 When the strands are cool, twist them to show that they are elastic.<br>
 Later the sulfur hardens, because it returns to the rhombic form of sulfur as a ring of eight sulfur atoms in tiny crystals.<br>
 When heated, the ring breaks open to form long chains.<br>

 An acid is a good electrolyte, reacts with active metals, turns blue litmus red and has a sour taste.<br>
 Acids contain hydrogen replaceable by metals.<br>
 Acids neutralize alkalis and alkalis neutralize acids.<br>
 Acids are sour corrosive, mainly liquids, that can dissolve metals.<br>
 Acids with water produce hydrogen ions, H<sup>+</sup>.<br>
 An acid is a proton donor (H<sup>+</sup>) (Bronsted-Lowry definition).<br>
 Acids an donate protons or accept pairs of electrons.<br>
 The "acid test" was originally the nitric acid test for gold, because only gold would not dissolve in it.<br>
 To acidify is to add acid to usually a solution.<br>
 Acidic substance have pH &lt; 7.<br>
 An acid salt is formed by an acid where incomplete exchange of replaceable hydrogen occurs.<br>
 An acid dye is a dye that is metallic salt of an acid and c an be applied in an acid medium.<br>

<a href="../images/12.18.1.gif">See diagram 12.18.1</a>: Sulfur crystals.<br>
 If the same element may have different bonding structure and crystal structure and so has different properties within, each variation of structure and properties is called an allotrope.<br>
 Sulfur has 3 allotropes, rhombic or α sulfur, monoclinic or β sulfur, and plastic sulfur.<br>
 Carbon has different bonding and crystal structure in the allotropes graphite and diamond.<br>
 Graphite is slippery, because weak van der Waals' forces between the flat layers allow them to slide over each other.<br>
 So graphite is used as a dry lubricant in machinery and in "lead" pencils.<br>
 Diamond has very high melting point and is extremely hard, because of strong chemical bonds holding the carbon atoms into a rigid three-dimensional structure, a network solid with a tetrahedral
arrangement, making it chemically unreactive.<br>
 However, diamond is a poor conductor of electricity, because the electrons are held in relatively fixed positions around the carbon atoms.<br>

 The boiling point of an azeotropic mixture may be higher or lower than any component.<br>
 An example of a constant boiling mixture is 4.37% water and 95.63% ethanol.<br>
 The mixture boils at 78.2<sup>o</sup>C, but pure ethanol boils at 78.4<sup>o</sup>C and water boils at 100<sup>o</sup>C.<br>

Oxygen is blown through the molten iron to react with carbon in the iron and remove it as carbon dioxide gas.<br>

 Pyrex and glass wool.<br>
 So borosilicate glass has a very low coefficient of thermal expansion and a softening temperature above 800<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 The composition may be 70% silica, 10% boron oxide and some sodium, potassium and calcium oxides.<br>

 Most buffer solutions are a mixture of a weak acid or base with one of its salts.<br>
 In body fluids, the buffers include H2CO3 with HCO3<sup>-</sup>.<br>
 Acidic buffer, e.g. sodium hydrogen carbonate with carbonic acid solutions, the salt of the weak acid is completely dissociated into ions.<br>

 Boiling chips, usually fused alumina, also flower pot bits, prevents large bubbles of gas forming that could cause explosive emissions from a beaker containing a heated solution.<br>
 Sudden formation of a large amount of vapour from the bottom of a heated vessel of liquid, rather than the usual controlled boiling.<br>
 So boiling chips (anti-bumping granules), are added to chemical reactions to keep the bubbles small and aid steady boiling.<br>
 Hydrocarbons with longer chains will have higher boiling points than similar hydrocarbons with branched chains, because they have more van der Waals intermolecular bonds between one molecule and

 1. The chemical potential energy stored in a substance is called the heat content or enthalpy.<br>
 In a chemical reaction, chemical bonds are broken in the reactants (energy is absorbed), and formed in the products, (energy is released).<br>
 The energy is measured in joules, J or more commonly in kilojoules, kJ, where 1000 J = 1 kJ.<br>
 2. In a chemical reaction energy is neither created nor destroyed, the law of conservation of energy and the First Law of Thermodynamics.<br>
 In an endothermic reaction, the amount of energy absorbed when chemical bonds are broken is greater than the amount of energy released when chemical bonds are formed.<br>
 In an exothermic reaction, the amount of energy absorbed when chemical bonds are broken is less than the amount of energy released when chemical bonds are formed.<br>
 3. The heat of reaction, δH, is the heat change for the reaction and is measured in a calorimeter.<br>
 If δH is negative, the reaction is endothermic.<br>
 The reaction releases heat energy and the container feels hotter.<br>
 If δH is positive the reaction is endothermic.<br>
 The reaction takes in heat energy and the container feels cooler.<br>

 Enzymes are biological catalysts that can speed up, and control, chemical reactions that would otherwise virtually never occur at normal body temperature, 37<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 Thousands of chemical reactions are occurring in the human body every moment of life, and each of these reactions is controlled by a particular enzyme, e.g. catalase breaks down potentially poisonous 
 hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen.<br>
 Enzymes are proteins that are specific in their action, but are not altered by the reaction, so they can be used repeatedly.<br>
 An enzymes is neither a reactants nor a product of a chemical equation it influences.<br>

 Also, you can use "non-flammable", but in chemistry do not use "inflammable".<br>
 Flammability, explosion, limits: outer limits for the ratio of fuel to air within which the mixture will burn.<br>
 The mishandling of flammable solvents has probably caused fires and personal injuries in chemical laboratories, especially the burning of loose long hair.<br>
 Staff and students must have securely fixed and contained hair by tying back the hair or using caps or hair nets.<br>
 Flammable solvents become more difficult to ignite as their boiling points rise, so use the highest boiling point solvent possible.<br>
 Do not use water baths to heat volatile flammable solvents.<br>
 Solvents should only be used by staff with students after assessment of the risks, which include not only flammability, but their toxicity, including possible allergic reactions.<br>
 2. Carbon disulfide has a greater flammability than ether and forms more dense vapours, with a low ignition temperature &lt; 100<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 Carbon disulfide is not permitted in schools.<br>
 3. Diethyl ether evaporates readily to form a heavy vapour in air, which can travel along the bench or floor in an air current.<br>

 4. Hydrogen forms violently explosive mixtures with air in almost any proportions and spontaneously combusts at concentrations greater than 4% in air.<br>
 Use this gas for demonstration purposes only in extremely small quantities or use soap bubble techniques.<br>
 5. Natural gas forms explosive mixtures with air so turn off heaters, Bunsen burners, and other equipment using natural gas and other flammable gases, e.g. acetylene.<br>
 6. Methylated spirit, ethanol and hydrocarbon solvents, e.g. petroleum spirit, hexane, pose the greatest risk in schools.<br>

A fuel cell is like a battery, except that fuels, e.g. methanol, rather than metals are consumed, and the reaction is not reversible.<br>
Fuel cells need a continuous source of fuel and oxygen from the air.<br>
However, in a battery, the energy comes from chemicals already stored in the battery.<br>

 Collect solution wastes of heavy metals, and reduce volume by allowing solvent (usually water), to evaporate.<br>
 Solid wastes of heavy metals should be recycled if practicable.<br>
Insoluble heavy metal salts, e.g. barium sulfate, may be placed in garbage.<br>
 Very often chemical disposal can be incorporated into student activity to demonstrate a chemical process.<br>
 For example, recrystallization of copper sulfate or displacement of copper from solution using steel wool.<br>

 Heavy metals recycling<br>
 Solutions of the following heavy metals may be treated for recycling:<br>
 antimony, barium, beryllium, chromium, cobalt, lead, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, selenium, strontium, tellurium, tin, vanadium,  zinc.<br>
 Precipitate insoluble metal salts with sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide or sodium sulfide.<br>
 Decant the clear solution above the precipitate and wash it down the sink.<br>
 Store the dried precipitate in a waste disposal bottle or use a displacement reaction to recover the elemental metal.<br>
 For example copper may be displaced from solution by adding steel wool to precipitate the copper.<br>
 Decant the clear solution above the precipitate and wash it down the sink.<br>
 Store the dried precipitate.<br>

 An hydronium ion H3O<sup>+</sup> is formed when acids dissociate in water.<br>
Water molecules are very polar.<br>
Electrons tend to “build up” on the oxygen side (oxygen atoms are very electronegative), leaving the H-atom-side of the molecule relatively positive.<br>
(H atoms are poorly electronegative).<br>
If an H+ ion comes close enough to a water molecule, it will be attracted to the oxygen side of a water molecule, yielding an hydronium ion.<br>
The rate of hydronium and hydroxyl ions forming water molecules is large, so few hydronium ions exist in water, 10<sup>-7</sup> moles/litre.<br>

 "Magic Sand" (Hydrophobic Sand), invisible in water, absorbent hydrophilic polymer (toy product).<br>
 The hydrophilic substances are "water-loving", polar molecule materials that mix with water.<br>
 Hydrophilic substancesare attracted to water and may dissolve in water to form hydrogen bonds, e.g. glucose, sugars.<br>
 They have an affinity for water and are readily absorbed or wetted by water.<br>
 Hydrophilic colloids readily form hydrosols or remain as hydrosols.<br>
 The hydrophobic substances are oily "water-hating", non-polar molecule materials  that do not mix with water or repel water, e.g. oils, proteins, greases, clays.<br>
 Hydrophobic colloids do not form or remain as hydrosols.<br>
 Hydrophobia is the aversion to water of a person suffering from the disease rabies.<br>
 Soap molecules have one end polar and the other end non-polar so they can attach to oils yet dissolve in water.<br>

To sequester is to take out of circulation, to tie up metal ions so that they do not interfere, to form a stable chelate complex or 
biochemical complex with an ion to remove it from solution or otherwise make it unreactive, e.g. by precipitating soaps.<br>
Sequestering agents are used to link undesirable metal ions together to form a stable structure that does not readily decompose and limits the metal ions’ ability 
to react with other ions, clays or polymers.<br>
Sequestering agents are commonly used for water treatment purposes to reduce water hardness. <br>
They combine with calcium, magnesium and other heavy metal ions in hard water to form molecules in which the ions are held so securely (sequestered) that they can no longer react.<br>
A sequestering agent surrounds another molecule or atom and holds it "in seclusion." so that it " hides" the molecule or atom and prevents it from entering into chemical reactions.<br>

 In the reaction of hydroxide ion with hydrogen chloride, the oxygen of hydroxide ion has -1 charge and the hydrogen of hydrogen chloride has <nobr>δ</nobr>+ charge,
because chlorine is more electronegative than hydrogen, so the H-Cl bonding electron pair is unequally shared.<br>
 The oxygen atom of hydroxide ion shares a lone electron pair with the hydrogen atom of hydrogen chloride.<br>
 In most organic chemistry reactions, one species in the reaction shares an electron pair (a Lewis base), with another species, (a Lewis acid), to form a covalent bond.<br>
 An electrophile, (Greek <i>electron</i> loving), (Lewis acid), is a molecule or ion that accepts a pair of electrons to make a covalent bond.<br>
 So a molecule, ion or atom that is electron deficient can be an electrophile, e.g. CH3<sup>+ </sup>methyl, HCl (H<nobr>δ</nobr><sup>+</sup>), NH4<sup>+ </sup>ammonium.<br>
 A nucleophile (Greek: nucleus loving) (Lewis base) is a molecule or ion that donates a pair of electrons to form a covalent bond.<br>
 So a molecule, ion or atom that has electrons that can be shared can be a nucleophile, e.g. I<sup>-</sup> iodide, NH3 ammonia.<br>
 Electrons always move from nucleophile to electrophile.<br>
 However, the oxygen atom of water has two lone pairs and a <nobr>δ</nobr><sup>-</sup> charge, because oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen, so 
 water can behave an a nucleophile, but each hydrogen atom has a <nobr>δ</nobr>+ charge, so the water molecule can also behave as anelectrophile.<br>
 If water reacts with an electrophile, it behaves as a nucleophile.<br>
 In organic chemistry, electrophiles are + ve charged reagents attracted to electron rich areas of molecules.<br>
