<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.5.1H">7.5.1</a> Prepare allotropes of sulfur<br>
Physical changes, prepare forms of sulfur, allotropes of sulfur<br>
<a href="../images/12.18.1.gif">See diagram 12.18.1</a>: Sulfur crystals.<br>
 1. Sulfur is a non-metallic element that occurs in several allotropic forms.<br>
 Allotropes are variations of the same element with bonding and crystal structure.<br>
 2. Sulfur occurs in three forms:<br>
 Form 1: Rhombic sulfur is a light yellow powder.<br>
 At 100, it changes to:<br>
 Form 2: Monoclinic sulfur with a deeper colour.<br>
 The monoclinic and rhombic forms differ in the arrangement of the S8 molecules.<br>
 At 160 oC , sulfur melts to form a sticky dark brown liquid that can be cooled quickly to form red brown plastic sulfur.<br>
 Form 3: Plastic sulfur contains long chains of S atoms.<br>
 Experiments<br>
 Put sulfur powder in a test-tube.<br>
 Heat the sulfur extremely gently until it slowly melts to a golden yellow liquid.<br>
 Continue to heat more strongly until a red gas appears above the liquid.<br>
 Leave the test-tube to cool.<br>
 Sulfur forms deposits on the sides of the tube and in the bottom of the tube.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.5.2H">7.5.2</a> Prepare monoclinic sulfur from powdered sulfur (flowers of sulfur)<br>
 Monoclinic sulfur has a deep yellow colour, m.p. = 119 oC , and density = 1.96.<br>
 Heat powdered sulfur extremely gently in an evaporating dish.<br>
 The sulfur changes to liquid.<br>
 Add more powdered sulfur.<br>
 The colour should stay pale yellow.<br>
 If the sulfur turns dark, you have overheated it.<br>
 Repeat the experiment with gentler heating.<br>
 Leave the sulfur to cool, without moving the evaporating dish.<br>
 Monoclinic crystals form between 96 oC  and 114 oC .<br>
 After a thin crust forms, punch two holes through the crust with a nail.<br>
 Pour out the hot sulfur through one hole.<br>
 Remove the crust and note the monoclinic sulfur crystals on the underside.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.5.3H">7.5.3</a> Prepare monoclinic crystals from roll sulfur<br>
 Put small pieces of roll sulfur in a test-tube.<br>
 Heat the test-tube extremely gently until the sulfur melts, m.p. = 114.5 oC .<br>
 The liquid is lemon yellow.<br>
 Pour the liquid sulfur into a folded filter paper.<br>
 A crust forms on the surface.<br>
 When the crust forms, open the filter paper.<br>
 Needle-shaped crystals remain on the filter paper.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.5.4H">7.5.4</a> Prepare plastic sulfur then rhombic sulfur<br>
 When heated to the melting point, sulfur usually ignites and forms sulfur dioxide gas that may distress people suffering from asthma.<br>
 Rhombic sulfur is a yellow powder, m.p. = 119 oC  , and density = 1.96.<br>
<a href="../images/12.18.1.gif">See diagram 12.18.1</a>: Sulfur crystals<br>
 Experiment<br>
 1. Put roll sulfur in a test-tube and heat the test-tube slowly.<br>
 Note the changes at the melting point from a light yellow colour to a red liquid.<br>
 The red brown sulfur becomes viscous and it does not flow out if you hold the test-tube upside down.<br>
 Continue heating until the reaction forms a brown black liquid.<br>
 Continue to heat until the sulfur boils at 445 oC .<br>
 <b>BE CAREFUL!</b><br>
 Pour the melted sulfur into a beaker of cold water.<br>
 The reaction forms strands of amorphous sulfur.<br>
 When the strands are cool, twist them to show that they are elastic.<br>
 Later the sulfur hardens, because it returns to the rhombic form of sulfur as a ring of eight sulfur atoms in tiny crystals.<br>
 When heated, the ring breaks open to form long chains.<br>
2. Almost fill a dry test-tube with sulfur powder and heat slowly to boiling, using a safety holder.<br>
Pour the boiling sulfur into a beaker of water.<br>
Immerse any floating sulfur with a stirring rod.<br>
Remove and examine the plastic sulfur.<br>
Note the gradual loss of elasticity as the plastic sulfur changes to rhombic sulfur.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.6.00H">7.6.0</a> Chemical changes and physical changes<br>
 1. In a chemical change, one or more substances changes into one or more new substances, e.g. hydrogen gas combines with oxygen gas to form water.<br>
 In this document the expression used is as follows: "hydrogen gas with oxygen gas forms water".<br>
 The new substances, the products, have properties different from the original substances, the reactants.<br>
 For example burning wood forms black ash containing carbon, white ash containing mineral salts, carbon dioxide gas and water vapour.<br>
 New substances form and the change cannot be reversed.<br>
 The arrow symbol " -->" represents this type of change.<br>
 2H2 (g) + O2 (g) --> 2H2O (l).<br>
 2. In a physical change, the properties: of a substance change, but the substance is still the same.<br>
 The change can be reversed.<br>
 The physical properties: of water change when water freezes to ice.<br>
 However, the ice is composed of water molecules and the change can be reversed.<br>
 When electricity passes through a tungsten filament in a light bulb, the filament becomes hot and emits light.<br>
 It is still tungsten.<br>
 When you turn off the light, the tungsten filament is the same as before.<br>
 Physical or chemical changes may be fast or slow, e.g. hammering iron, wearing away rock by wind erosion, an explosion when hydrogen gas burns, rusting of iron.<br>
3. Classify common examples of changes into chemical change or physical change.<br>
 Do the following activities and in each case say whether it is a chemical or physical change:<br>
 1. Light a match (chemical change).<br>
 2. Turn on the light (physical change).<br>
 3. Let a nail rust (chemical change takes place in air causing a gain in weight).<br>
 4. Chew food (physical change for biting and masticating, and chemical change for the reactions of starch with salivary amylase).<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.6.3H">7.6.3</a> Burn magnesium and weigh the products<br>
 Put a piece of magnesium ribbon in a crucible.<br>
 Weigh the crucible and lid and magnesium ribbon.<br>
 Burn the magnesium in the nearly closed crucible so that the ash is not lost.<br>
 Weigh the crucible and lid and ash.<br>
 The weight of the ash is greater than the weight of the magnesium.<br>
 The reaction forms a new substance, magnesium oxide.<br>
 Mg, density 1.74 g / cm3 oxidizes to MgO, density 3.58 g / cm3, so when oxygen attaches to magnesium the volume decreases, because of the strength of the (Mg2+-- O2-) bond.<br>
 2Mg (s) + O2 (g) --> 2MgO (s).<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.6.4H">7.6.4</a> Burn steel wool and weigh the products<br>
 Cover the end of a wooden ruler with aluminium foil then note where the ruler balances as a first order lever, see-saw, over a fulcrum.<br>
 Put the ruler balance on a sink bench.<br>
 Put 5 g loose steel wool on the aluminium foil end of the ruler then put a weight on the other end of the ruler so that this end is just down.<br>
 Heat the steel wool with a Bunsen burner flame.<br>
 The steel wool glows and its side of the balance moves down as the iron becomes iron oxide.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.6.5H">7.6.5</a> Empirical formula of magnesium oxide<br>
Method 1.<br>
To obtain useful data when burning magnesium, problems may occur with igniting the Mg, keeping the Mg burning and recording very little or no mass gain.<br>
Using only 3 cm is not enough so coil it up and use about 25cm in a crucible over a Bunsen burner to obtain reasonable results.<br>
Use sandpaper on the magnesium before experimenting tp remove the oxide layer, then place the magnesium in the crucible, leaving the lid open until it was just about to react.<br>
Make sure that as much of as possible of the coiled longer piece is in contact with the crucible.<br>
Leave the lid off until it ignites, then, while still heating, keep raising the crucible lid with tongs to let in more oxygen, without releasing too much ash. until the reaction appears complete.<br>
Method 2.<br>
Weigh magnesium then heat it in a crucible so that it reacts with oxygen to produce magnesium oxide.<br>
There has been an increase in mass.<br>
Use the results can be used to find the formula of magnesium oxide.<br>
Procedure<br>
If the magnesium ribbon looks tarnished or black, clean it with sand paper.<br>
1. Cut a piece of magnesium ribbon about 10cm long and twist it into a loose coil.<br>
2. Weigh the crucible with the lid and then weigh the magnesium inside the crucible with the lid.<br>
3. Set up the Bunsen burner on the heat resistant mat with the tripod.<br>
Place a pipe clay triangle over the tripod.<br>
Place the crucible containing the magnesium in the pipe clay triangle and put the lid on at an angle so air can still get into the crucible.<br>
4. Light the Bunsen burner and begin to heat the crucible.<br>
Start with a gentle blue flame, but you will need to use a roaring flame, with the air hole fully open, to get the reaction.<br>
5. When the crucible is hot, gently lift the lid with the tongs a little to allow some oxygen to get in.<br>
The magnesium may begin to flare up.<br>
Do not lift the lid is off for too long, because the magnesium oxide product will begin to escape from the crucible.<br>.
Repeat this procedure until you see no further reaction.<br>
6. Turn off the Bunsen burner, allow the apparatus to cool, then re-weigh the crucible with lid containing the product.<br>
7. Heat the crucible again for a couple of minutes, allow to cool, and repeat this step until the mass readings are consistent.<br>
This procedure is called ""heating to constant mass".<br>
2Mg + O2 --> 2MgO<br>
Magnesium + oxygen --> magnesium oxide<br>
To find the formula of magnesium oxide, divide mass by the atomic mass for each element, to give the number of moles of each.<br>
The relative atomic mass of magnesium is 24 and for oxygen is 16.<br>
Find the ratio between the two by dividing them both by the smallest number.<br>
The ratio should be close to 1:1, because the formula of magnesium oxide is MgO.<br>
Example calculation<br>
Mass magnesium = 2.39 g, Mass magnesium oxide = 3.78 g, So mass oxygen = 1.39 g<br>
Number moles Mg = 2.39/24 = 0.0995<br>
Number moles O = 1.39/16 = 0.0868<br>
Divide by the smallest to give the ratio approx. 1 Mg: 1O.<br>
This result suggests a formula of MgO, which is the correct formula.<br>
One teacher got students to all do different lengths, and them plot moles of Mg on X axis and moles of O on Y axis (by subtraction and processing) and tried to get a gradient of 1.<br>
Possible errors include the following:<br>
* the magnesium oxide product may escape as students lift the lid,<br>
* not all the magnesium may have reacted, because the product may still look a bit grey rather than white,<br>
* students may have prodded the product with their splint, so not all of it got weighed,<br>
* the balanced was not tared correctly for one of the weighings,<br>
* the magnesium was coiled too tightly so that not all of it reacted,<br>
* the tripods not at the correct height so that the hottest part of the flame not exactly where the crucible is sitting in the clay triangle,<br>
* some Bunsen burners produce much hotter flames than others, so find one that produce a good flame or use two Bunsen burners if the gas turrets, have two taps, to put two burners on with it,<br>
* if start seeing puffs of whitish “smoke coming out, MgO is being lost,<br>
* students stopped heating before all of the magnesium was powdered ash.<br>
* students failed to record the mass of the empty crucible,<br>
* students could only obtain an around 70% yield.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.6.6H">7.6.6</a> Chemical changes, heat organic substances<br>
 1. Often one product is black, because carbon forms.<br>
 Heat the following substances in a hard glass or Pyrex test-tube.<br>
 Observe any decomposition of the substances.<br>
 When smoke appears, leave the test-tube to cool.<br>
 No chemical change occurs when you heat charcoal.<br>
 For the following substances, a chemical change occurs and the residue in the test-tube is carbon:<br>
 Experiments<br>
 1. Heat wood or saw dust, and note the brown substances that stick to the sides of the test-tube and the black substance that remain in the bottom.<br>
 2. Heat the following substances, sugar, bread, fruit, fat or oil, starch, potato, rice, paper, wool, hair, nail clippings, meat.<br>
 Heat the tube gently then more strongly.<br>
 The wood decomposes into a black solid and brown liquids and vapours.<br>
 Stop heating when you see no more dense smoke.<br>
 Let the test-tube and observe the substances on the sides of the test-tube.<br>
 Put any remaining solid substance in another clean test-tube.<br>
 Heat it gently and then more strongly.<br>
 You produce no further liquids or gases from this substance.<br>
 Compare the black substance with a sample of the original wood for colour and can be bent.<br>
 Place the end of each in a Bunsen flame for a few seconds.<br>
 Remove and observe them.<br>
 The black substance does not decompose or burn with a flame but, glows red hot.<br>
 The black substance is charcoal, i.e. carbon.<br>
 3. Heat small quantities of sugar, paper, wool, meat and compare the residue in the test-tubes with the original substance.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.6.7H">7.6.7</a> Chemical changes, heat metals in chlorine<br>
 Be Careful! Chlorine is poisonous.<br>
 These experiment may not be allowed on your school system.<br>
 Do the experiments in a fume cupboard.<br>
 Experiments<br>
 1. Use tongs to heat steel wool in a Bunsen burner flame, then place it in a test-tube containing chlorine gas.<br>
 Observe whether any heat is given out during the reaction.<br>
 Iron and chlorine react together to form a brown yellow iron chloride.<br>
 2. Using a wire gauze, scrape some powdered antimony from a lump of the element so that it falls into a test-tube of chlorine.<br>
 The sparks and burning show that a chemical change is taking place.<br>
 The new white substance is antimony chloride.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.6.8H">7.6.8</a> Physical changes, magnetize and demagnetize iron wire<br>
 When physical changes occur, no new substance forms.<br>
 Pull a thick iron wire (fencing wire), through iron filings.<br>
 The iron does not attract the iron filings.<br>
 Magnetize the iron by stroking it with a bar magnet.<br>
 Hold the iron wire in the iron filings.<br>
 The iron wire now attracts the iron filings, so a physical change has occurred.<br>
 Hammer the iron wire, the iron wire cannot attract the iron filings so strongly, so the physical change has been reversed.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.2.0H">7.2.0</a> Pure substances and impure substances, elements and compounds<br>
 1. Pure substances contains only one kind of atom or molecule, e.g. iron, sulfur, water, and oxygen.<br>
 It can consist of elements or compounds.<br>
 Elements may be metals or non-metals.<br>
 Impure substances contain more than one kind of substance.<br>
 They may be mixtures, e.g. sulfur and iron filings, or air, or solutions, e.g. sea water.<br>
 Mixtures in the home include flour, milk, ink, face powder, and tooth paste.<br>
 Solutions in the home include fruit drinks, (although often an emulsion), lemonade, mineral water.<br>
 You can make toffee or candy with a supersaturated sugar solution.<br>
 French polish is shellac with methylated spirit solution.<br>
 2. An element cannot be broken down into simpler substances by a chemical reaction and all the atoms in it have the same atomic number, the number of protons and electrons is the same, but the 
number of neutrons may vary.<br>
 Ninety-two (92), naturally occurring elements exist.<br>
 3. A compound is composed of two or more elements combined in fixed proportions as a result of a chemical reaction and which cannot be separated into simpler substances by any physical process, 
 e.g. shaking.<br>
 Most compounds are ionic, e.g. common salt (NaCl), or covalent molecular, e.g. CO2 or H2O, or covalent network, e.g. SiO2.<br>
 Each compound has a name or formula.<br>
 4. Inorganic chemistry is the chemistry of the elements and their compounds, including CO2, CO and carbonates.<br>
 Organic chemistry is the chemistry of carbon and its compounds.<br>

 If a solution is a homogeneous mixture of a liquid with a gas or a solid, then you would not classify air as a solution, nor brass as an alloy, unless they were in liquid form.<br>
 However, if a solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more components in a single phase, and usually refers to a solution in water (aqueous solution), then perhaps you can classify air and solid alloys 
 as solutions.<br>

 (Latin: acidus, sour tasting)<br>
 An acid is a good electrolyte, reacts with active metals, turns blue litmus red and has a sour taste.<br>
 Acids contain hydrogen replaceable by metals.<br>
 Acids neutralize alkalis and alkalis neutralize acids.<br>
 Acids are sour corrosive, mainly liquids, that can dissolve metals.<br>
 Acids with water produce hydrogen ions, H+.<br>
 An acid is a proton donor (H+) (Bronsted-Lowry definition).<br>
 Acids an donate protons or accept pairs of electrons.<br>
 The "acid test" was originally the nitric acid test for gold, because only gold would not dissolve in it.<br>
 To acidify is to add acid to usually a solution.<br>
 Acidic substance have pH &lt; 7.<br>
 An acid salt is formed by an acid where incomplete exchange of replaceable hydrogen occurs.<br>
 An acid dye is a dye that is metallic salt of an acid and c an be applied in an acid medium.<br>

<a href="../images/12.18.1.gif">See diagram 12.18.1</a>: Sulfur crystals.<br>
 If the same element may have different bonding structure and crystal structure and so has different properties within, each variation of structure and properties is called an allotrope.<br>
 Sulfur has 3 allotropes, rhombic or α sulfur, monoclinic or β sulfur, and plastic sulfur.<br>
 Carbon has different bonding and crystal structure in the allotropes graphite and diamond.<br>
 Graphite is slippery, because weak van der Waals' forces between the flat layers allow them to slide over each other.<br>
 So graphite is used as a dry lubricant in machinery and in "lead" pencils.<br>
 Diamond has very high melting point and is extremely hard, because of strong chemical bonds holding the carbon atoms into a rigid three-dimensional structure, a network solid with a tetrahedral
arrangement, making it chemically unreactive.<br>
 However, diamond is a poor conductor of electricity, because the electrons are held in relatively fixed positions around the carbon atoms.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.4.5H">7.4.5</a> Amphoteric<br>
Amphoteric substances can act as an acid or a base, e.g. water, bicarbonate ion.<br>
 Similarly, bicarbonate ion can act as an acid to donate a proton to form carbonate ion:<br>
 HCO3- + H2O --> CO32- + H3O+<br>
 Also, bicarbonate ion can act as a base to accept a proton to form carbonic acid:<br>
 HCO3- + H2O --> H2CO3 + OH-.<br>

 Amphoteric oxides react with both acids and bases, e.g. Al2O3, PbO, SnO ZnO.<br>
 Their hydroxides are also amphoteric.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.4.6H">7.4.6</a> Anti-bumping granules, boiling chips<br>
 Anti-bumping granules, boiling chips (- ceramic, silicon carbide, fused alumina)<br>
 Boiling chips, usually fused alumina, also flower pot bits, prevents large bubbles of gas forming that could cause explosive emissions from a beaker containing a heated solution.<br>
 Sudden formation of a large amount of vapour from the bottom of a heated vessel of liquid, rather than the usual controlled boiling.<br>
 So boiling chips (anti-bumping granules), are added to chemical reactions to keep the bubbles small and aid steady boiling.<br>
 Hydrocarbons with longer chains will have higher boiling points than similar hydrocarbons with branched chains, because they have more van der Waals intermolecular bonds between one molecule and 
another molecule.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.4.8H">7.4.8</a> Atoms<br>
 Atom is the smallest division of an element that can chemically exist alone and have the characteristics of the element.<br>
 Atomic mass (atomic weight), of an atom is arbitrarily defined relative to the mass of the isotope carbon.<br>
 The relative atomic mass of an element is the ratio of average mass of atoms of the element to 1 / 12 of the mass of one atom of the isotope C-12.<br>
 Atomic mass unit (a.m.u.), is a unit of mass used to express the relative atomic mass.<br>
 So 1 atomic mass unit = 1 / 12 of the mass of the carbon-12 isotope, i.e. 1.66 × 10-27 kg.<br>
 The mass of 1 atom of oxygen = 16 a.m.u.<br>
 The atomic theory dates from the 5th century B.C. when Greek philosophers, e.g. Democritus, said that matter consists of indivisible indestructible particles.<br>
 The modern atomic theory started with the hypothetical thinking of John Dalton, England (1766 - 1844).<br>
 However, he did not envisage the structure of atoms, i.e. nucleus, electrons and other particles.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.4.9H">7.4.9</a> Constant boiling mixture, azeotrope<br>
An azeotrope, a mixture of liquids that has a constant boiling point, because the vapour has the same composition as the liquid mixture.<br>
The components of the solution cannot be separated by distillation.<br>
The boiling point of an azeotrope mixture may be higher or lower than any component.<br>
An example of a constant boiling mixture is 4.37% water and 95.63% ethanol.<br>
The mixture boils at 78.2 oC  , but pure ethanol boils at 78.4 oC   and water boils at 100 oC  .<br>

 A base is a proton acceptor (H+) (Bronsted-Lowry definition).<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.4.11H">7.4.11</a> Battery sulfation<br>
 Sulfation on plates of a lead-acid battery, secondary cell, causes reduced efficiency, because PbSO4 forms.<br>
 Sulfation is the effect of overcharging or other environmental conditions in lead acid batteries that leads to permanent capacity loss.<br>
 Flakes of lead sulfate break away from the plates and fall to the bottom of the cell, where they can no longer react and produce energy.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.4.12H">7.4.12</a> Bessemer process<br>
The Bessemer process, invented by Sir Henry Bessemer, 1813-1898, England, converts pig iron from a blast furnace into steel by blowing air or pure oxygen into the molten impure metal to convert impurities into a separating slag.<br>
Oxygen is blown through the molten iron to react with carbon in the iron and remove it as carbon dioxide gas.<br>
The reaction which gives off a lot of heat to raise and maintain the temperature of the molten steel.<br>
The process was changed to first removing all the carbon from the melt, then introducing 1 per cent of carbon to make the steel.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.4.14H">7.4.14</a> Buffers<br>
 A mixture of substances that tend to hinder large changes in acid or basic properties of a solution.<br>
 The term "buffer" is used in a more general sense outside chemistry.<br>
 The pH of a buffer solution is not greatly changed by the addition of an acid or an alkali.<br>
 Most buffer solutions are a mixture of a weak acid or base with one of its salts.<br>
 In body fluids, the buffers include H2CO3 with HCO3-.<br>
 Acidic buffer, e.g. sodium hydrogen carbonate with carbonic acid solutions, the salt of the weak acid is completely dissociated into ions.<br> 
However, the weak acid is only partly dissociated.<br>
 Basic buffer, e.g. ammonium chloride in ammonia solutions.<br>

 1. Compounds are composed of two or more elements that are chemically united in fixed proportion.<br>
 Compounds can be broken down to simple substances.<br>
 Chemical compounds form when chemical bonds, whether ionic or covalent, are formed between different elements.<br>
 A chemical compound can be represented by a chemical formula.<br>
 Forces weaker than covalent bonding exist between molecules.<br>
 In compounds containing carbon-hydrogen bonds, organic compounds, the carbon atoms bind to one another through single, double or triple covalent bonds to form chains or rings.<br>
 Observe samples of iron, carbon, copper, magnesium, mercury in a thermometer and solid sticks of sulfur.<br>
 2. Classify each compound according to the following characteristics:<br>
 * Is it a hard solid, a liquid or a gas at room temperature?<br>
 * If the element is a solid, does it shine and have a lustre?<br>
 If necessary, scratch its surface.<br>
 * Can the element be bent or twisted or does it fracture easily?
 You may require pliers to do this.<br>
 * Will the element conduct electricity?<br>
 Place the element between two electrical contacts in a circuit.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.4.16H">7.4.16</a> Chemical potential energy, enthalpy<br>
 1. The chemical potential energy stored in a substance is called the heat content or enthalpy.<br>
 In a chemical reaction, chemical bonds are broken in the reactants (energy is absorbed), and formed in the products, (energy is released).<br>
 The energy is measured in joules, J or more commonly in kilojoules, kJ, where 1000 J = 1 kJ.<br>
 2. In a chemical reaction energy is neither created nor destroyed, the law of conservation of energy and the First Law of Thermodynamics.<br>
 In an endothermic reaction, the amount of energy absorbed when chemical bonds are broken is greater than the amount of energy released when chemical bonds are formed.<br>
 In an exothermic reaction, the amount of energy absorbed when chemical bonds are broken is less than the amount of energy released when chemical bonds are formed.<br>
 3. The heat of reaction, δH, is the heat change for the reaction and is measured in a calorimeter.<br>
 If δH is negative, the reaction is endothermic.<br>
 The reaction releases heat energy and the container feels hotter.<br>
 If δH is positive the reaction is endothermic.<br>
 The reaction takes in heat energy and the container feels cooler.<br>
 Energy is usually measured at 100 kPa and 298 K.<br>

 Atoms of an element may contain different numbers of neutrons, and are known as isotopes.<br>
 Every element is assigned a unique chemical symbol.<br>
 At room temperature and atmospheric pressure, eleven elements are gases: H2, He, N2, O2, F2, Ne, Cl2, Ar, Kr, Xe, Rn.<br>
 Two elements are liquids at room temperature: Hg and Br.<br>
 Reactive elements have atoms weakly bound together and have electrons available for bonding, e.g. F.<br>
 Unreactive elements have atoms joined by strong bonds, e.g. diamond.<br>
 Elements that exist as separate small molecules have low boiling points and melting points, e.g. He, O2.<br>

The simplest case is hydrogen gas bubbled over a porous sintered nickel anode in alkali solution, while oxygen is bubbled over a similar cathode separated by a porous membrane.<br>
2H2 (g) + O2 (g) --> 2H2O (l)<br>
An electric current is produced in an external circuit.<br>
A fuel cell is like a battery, except that fuels, e.g. methanol, rather than metals are consumed, and the reaction is not reversible.<br>
Fuel cells need a continuous source of fuel and oxygen from the air.<br>
However, in a battery, the energy comes from chemicals already stored in the battery.<br>

The differences are the different movement of ions across the electrolyte, (indicative of the relevant H+ and OH- concentrations).<br>
In acidic cells, the water product exits on the same side as the oxygen, (indicative of H+ moving across the electolyte).<br>
In alkaline cells, the water product exits on the same side as the hydrogen, indicative of the Oxygen, (as hydroxide). moving across the electrolyte.<br>

 From New South Wales Department of Education publication "Chemical safety in schools":<br>
 Not all heavy metal salts are toxic, but most are, i.e. arsenic, lead, cadmium and mercury compounds are extremely hazardous.<br>
 Heavy metals are toxic by ingestion, by inhalation of dusts or fumes, and by skin contact especially with chromates, which can cause dermatitis.<br>
 It is important to use safe working practices to prevent student contact with heavy metal salts.<br>
 Some heavy metal salts are powerful oxidants and may also present a reactive hazard.<br>
 Avoid or control contact of heavy metals with reducing agents.<br>
 Collect solution wastes of heavy metals, and reduce volume by allowing solvent (usually water), to evaporate.<br>
 Solid wastes of heavy metals should be recycled if practicable.<br>
Insoluble heavy metal salts, e.g. barium sulfate, may be placed in garbage.<br>
 Very often chemical disposal can be incorporated into student activity to demonstrate a chemical process.<br>
 For example, recrystallization of copper sulfate or displacement of copper from solution using steel wool.<br>

(H atoms are poorly electronegative).<br>
If an H+ ion comes close enough to a water molecule, it will be attracted to the oxygen side of a water molecule, yielding an hydronium ion.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.4.49H">7.4.49</a> Sequester<br>
To sequester is to take out of circulation, to tie up metal ions so that they do not interfere, to form a stable chelate complex or 
biochemical complex with an ion to remove it from solution or otherwise make it unreactive, e.g. by precipitating soaps.<br>
Sequestering agents are used to link undesirable metal ions together to form a stable structure that does not readily decompose and limits the metal ions’ ability 
to react with other ions, clays or polymers.<br>
Sequestering agents are commonly used for water treatment purposes to reduce water hardness. <br>
They combine with calcium, magnesium and other heavy metal ions in hard water to form molecules in which the ions are held so securely (sequestered) that they can no longer react.<br>
A sequestering agent surrounds another molecule or atom and holds it "in seclusion." so that it " hides" the molecule or atom and prevents it from entering into chemical reactions.<br>

 The most widely studied compound, usually just called "dioxin", C12H4Cl4O2, (2,3,78-TCDD), "TCDD", IUPAC Name: 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, a by-product of manufacture of herbicide, "2,4,5-T", 2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxyacetic acid, (C8H5Cl3O3)<br>
 It was a compenent of the "Agent Orange" defoliant used in the Vietnam War, 1954-75.<br>
 Dioxins are chlorinated hydrocarbon compounds called dibenzo-p-dioxins.<br>
 The compounds have low water solubility, low vapour pressure many are very stable and tend to bioaccumulate, e.g. in human milk.<br>
 They are very toxic and persist in the environment for long periods.<br>
 They are produced during incineration of wastes and are a contaminant in chemical manufacturing processes.<br>
 They interfere with the action of hormones and the genetic system even in very small concentrations.<br>
 They accumulate in the fat cells, but are not metabolized.<br>
 They damage the immune system, leading to increased susceptibility to infectious disease.<br>
 When chemicals and plastics are manufactured or burned, dioxin may be produced as a by-product and dumped into landfill.<br>
 Landfill gas may include dioxins, which may spread into the community if landfill gas, mainly methane is burned as a source of energy.<br>
 An important source of dioxins is from burning polyvinyl chloride in incinerators.<br>
 Agent orange was widely thought to ruin the agricultural economy and be the cause of infant birth defects of children in Vietnam and in US military families during the Vietnam War, (1954-75).<br>
 The name "Agent Orange" came from the colour-coding orange stripe on the preparation package.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2">16.14.4 PFAS chemicals<br>
<a href="https://www.pfas.gov.au/about-pfas/substances"> PFAS</a>, Australian Government<br>
PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, is the broad name for 4,700 chemicals that do not break down, and instead accumulate in the soil, water, and human bodies.<br> 
1. (CNN) PFAS chemicals are known as “forever chemicals,” a family of potentially thousands of synthetic chemicals that are extremely persistent in the environment and in our bodies.<br>
 PFAS is short for perfluoroalky and polyfluoroalkyl substances and includes chemicals known as PFOS, PFOA and GenX.<br>
They are all identified by signature elemental bonds of fluorine and carbon, which are extremely strong and what make it so difficult for these chemicals to disintegrate in the environment or in our bodies.<br>
PFAS chemicals have been highly utilized in various industries, because of their ability to repel oil and water.<br>
They’ve been manufactured since the 1940s and can be found in Teflon nonstick products, stains and water repellants, paints, cleaning products, food packaging and firefighting foams.<br>
A growing body of science has found that there are potential adverse health impacts associated with PFAS exposure, including liver damage, thyroid disease, decreased fertility, high cholesterol, obesity, hormone suppression and cancer.<br>
These chemicals can easily migrate into the air, dust, food, soil and water.<br>
People can also be exposed to them through food packaging and industrial exposure.<br>
Emergency response teams hand out free bottled water to residents at the Parchment High School in Parchment, Mich., Friday, July 27, 2018.<br>
Authorities handed out thousands of free bottles of water Friday for two southwestern Michigan communities where the discovery of contamination from toxic industrial chemicals prompted a warning against using the public water system for drinking or cooking. (Daniel Vasta/Kalamazoo Gazette via AP)<br>
“I think that people should be concerned about the amount of PFOA and PFOS that is in our environment,” Susan M. Pinney, a professor in the Department of Environmental Health at the University of Cincinnati, US, wrote in an email.<br>
“These are chemicals with long half-lives,” meaning they persist in the environment as well as the body.<br>
They can also accumulate over time.<br>
In the body, they primarily settle into the blood, kidney and liver. A study from 2007 by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that PFAS chemicals could be detected in the blood of 98% of the US population.<br>
“Exposure in utero may have the greatest effect on developing children … and effects may last into adulthood,” Pinney said, adding that the science is still early.<br>
PFOS and PFOA are the two most-studied PFAS chemicals and have been identified as contaminants of emerging concern by the Environmental Protection Agency.<br>
2. (ABC) The Australian federal government has settled a class action over PFAS contamination from firefighting foam at seven sites across the country, 
but residents are calling the amount "atrocious".<br>
About 30,000 claimants will be paid $132.7m from the Commonwealth over historic contamination of regional towns.<br> 
The settlement follows a $212m PFAS payout for property value loss and distress in Katherine, Oakey, and Williamtown.<br>
PFAS is a broad name for 4,700 heat-resistant chemicals that were found to be toxic in groundwater near air force bases.<br> 
The Commonwealth Government of Australia will pay out $132.7 million to about 30,000 claimants.<br>
The claim alleged landowners at the sites were exposed to poisonous chemicals in firefighting foam used at military bases after it leached into groundwater.<br>
The sites are Wagga Wagga and Richmond in New South Wales, Wodonga in Victoria, Darwin in the Northern Territory, Townsville in Queensland, Edinburgh in South Australia, and Bullsbrook in Western Australia.<br>
Perfluoroalkyls are stable, synthetic chemicals which repel oil, grease, and water.<br>
They have been used in surface protection coatings for carpet, clothing, paper, cardboard packaging, and in fire-fighting foams.<br>
The largest amounts made in the US are perflurooctanoic acid, (PFOA), and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, (PFOS).

 For flame protection the congeners are 5 to 10 bromine atoms.<br>
 PBB consists of two directly linked benzene rings, and up to 10 bromine atoms.<br>
 PCB is a partly volatile liquid while the current flame retardants are solid with very low volatility.<br>
 Both PBDE and PBB are additive substances, i.e. without chemical reaction they are mixed with materials to be anti-inflammable.<br>
 Like the corresponding chlorinated substances, can develop dioxins and furans (polybrominated dibenzodioxins and polybrominated dibenzofurans) in case of incomplete combustion.<br>
 Some of the corresponding chlorinated substances have a very high toxicity as well as being carcinogenic.<br>
 The toxic effects of brominated dioxins and furans are not known.<br>
 PBB has been detected in human milk.<br>
 Many PBDEs have been banned in many countries.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.14.2H">16.14.2</a> PFOA, Perfluorooctanoic acid, C8HF15O2<br>
 Perfluorooctanoic acid, (PFOA), (C8HF15O2), a surfactant, is used to make non-stick cookware, e.g. PTFE, ("Teflon"), and stain-resistant footwear and clothing.<br>
 It persists in the environment and is toxic to animals and may be a carcinogen.<br>
 Long-chain perfluorinated chemicals, LCPFCs, are very persistent in the environment and are found in the blood of the general U.S. population and in human milk.<br>
 PFOA is used to make fluoropolymers, e.g. polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE).<br>
 Teflon TM is not a specific chemical or product.<br>
 Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), is used in the process of making Teflon and similar fluorotelomers, but it is burned off during the process and is not present in significant amounts in the final products, 
 e.g. non-stick cookware.<br>
 Some major manufacturers have agreed to eliminate the use of PFOA by 2015.<br>
 They are increasingly linked to cancer, liver and thyroid disease, immune suppression and reduced fertility.<br>
 Fluoroform (CHF3)<br>
 Tetrafluoroethene (CF2CF2), Teflon <br>
 Polytetrafluoroethene (PTFE, Teflon), poly(1.1.2,2-tetrafluoroethylene), Repeat unit: -[CF2=CF2]n-), (C2F4)<br>
 "Teflon" is a synthetic fluoropolymer of tetrafluoroethylene.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.14.3H">16.14.3</a>. PFOS, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, C8HF17O3S<br>
 Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), man-made fluorosurfactant and global pollutant was the key ingredient in Scotchgard, a fabric protector and different stain repellents.<br>
 PFOS was added to Annex B of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants in May 2009, so it is banned under international environmental treaties.<br>
 In Australia, June 2016, residents of the town of Oakey have received assistance from an AUD 55 million dollar government assistance to fund blood testing and counselling, fearful of contamination 
 from PFOS and PFOA fire fighting chemicals used at the Oakey Army Aviation Base, southern Queensland. Residents are also asking for a government commitment to buying back contaminated land or adequate compensation.<br>
 These chemicals have also been found at Brisbane Airport and close to the Williamtown RAAF base, near Newcastle.<br>
 They are increasingly linked to cancer, liver and thyroid disease, immune suppression and reduced fertility.<br>
 Australian health protection drinking water guidelines of 0.5 micrograms per litre for PFOS and 5 micrograms per litre for PFOA are said to be above the 0.07 micrograms per litre adopted by the US.<br>
 In addition to industrial production, PFOS can form from the degradation of its precursors.<br>
 PFOS levels detected in wildlife are thought to be high enough to affect health parameters, and higher serum levels of PFOS are associated with increased risk of chronic kidney disease in the U.S.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.14.6H">16.14.6</a> Erucic acid, C22H42O2<br>
Erucic acid, 13-docosenoic acid (C22H42O2), monounsaturated omega-9 fatty acid, very long chain 22-carbon backbone and single double bond, in Brassicaceae oils, often with bitter-tasting compounds, used as transmission oil, because high tolerance to temperature, readily bio-degradable, binder for oil paints, in mustard oil, in rapeseed oil, but not in canola oil.<br>
Babies should not be given foods high in erucic acid.<br>
