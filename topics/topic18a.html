<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="18.7.0H"></a>18.7.0 Swimming pool chemistry<br>
A swimming pool system lacks the three purifiers that protect water quality in natural bodies of water:<br>
1. Aeration, the addition of oxygen to the water from the continuous flow of water through lakes, streams and rivers.<br>
2. Dilution of sediment from continuous water flow.<br>
3. Prevention of contaminant build-up by water flow, movement and dilution, and biodegradation by aquatic organisms.<br>
 As a swimming pool lacks these purifiers, it is subject to rapid stagnation.<br>
 Also, it is usually contaminated with bacteria, algae, dust and dirt, and organic materials from swimmers wastes, sweat, urine and faeces.<br>
 A swimming pool must be disinfected as part of a total system to remove bacteria, algae and organic contaminants leaving water with acceptable clarity and colour.<br>
 Volume of a swimming pool length × width × depth.<br>
 If length 25 m, width 10 m, depth 1 m to 2 m (average 1.5 m), then volume = 25 × 10 × 1.5 = 375 cubic metres (375 000 litres).<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="18.7.1.0H"></a>18.7.1.0 Chlorine and water<br>
 When chlorine is added to water, a mixture of hypochlorous acid, HOCl, the active sanitizing species, and hydrochloric acid, HCl, forms within seconds at room temperature.<br>
 Cl2 (aq) + 2H2O &lt;=&gt; HOCl + Cl<sup>-</sup> + H3O<sup>+</sup><br>
 chlorine + water &lt;=&gt; hypochlorous acid + chloride ion + hydronium ion.<br>
 In dilute solution and pH &gt; 4, the equilibrium displaces to the right, and little Cl2 exists in solution.<br>
 The chlorine added to swimming pool water does not produce a concentrated solution of a strength to yield such a low pH.<br>
 However, the oxidizing property of the added chlorine is in the HOCl formed and produces the main disinfecting action of added chlorine solutions.<br>
 Hypochlorous acid dissociates almost instantaneously into hydrogen and hypochlorite ions.<br>
 The reaction is reversible.<br>
 The dissociation depends on the pH and temperature.<br>
 Hypochlorous acid exists in a pH dependent equilibrium with hypochlorite ion (OCl<sup>-</sup>) in swimming pool water.<br>
 H2O + HOCl &lt;=&gt; H3O<sup>+</sup> + OCl<sup>-</sup>
 water + hypochlorous acid &lt;=.&gt; hydronium ion + hypochlorite ion.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="18.7.2.0H"></a>18.7.2.0 Chlorination of swimming pools<br>
<a href="../images/13.4.2ch.gif">See diagram 13.4.2</a>: Distribution of HOCl and OCR<sup>-</sup>in water at pH levels.<br>
 Most swimming pools are sanitized with chlorine-based compounds.<br>
 When chlorine compounds are dissolved in water, hypochlorous acid forms, which does the actual sanitizing.<br>
 In most cases, the non-chlorine part of the chlorine compound serves no other purpose than to hold the chlorine until the product dissolves.<br>
 The three categories of sanitizer contain chlorine in different forms.<br>
 All three sanitizers are compatible and effective with other chemicals in swimming pool water.<br>
 Each will do its function without causing objectionable tastes, odours or colours in the water, if properly applied.<br>
 Swimming pool chlorine may be calcium hypochlorite or sodium hypochlorite.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="18.7.2.1H"></a>18.7.2.1 Chlorine gas in swimming pools<br>
 Chlorine is a member of the halogen family of sanitizers.<br>
 Its use in swimming pools is in the form of a gas, as a liquid, in granular or tablet forms.<br>
 When added to swimming pool water it acts as an oxidizer, sanitizer, disinfectant and biocidal agent.<br>
 Chlorine gas is referred to as having 100% available chlorine, is relatively low cost and is used in public swimming pools and most bulk drinking and waste water treatment systems.<br>
 However, it is a gas that must be delivered in bulky metal cylinders and has to be applied to the water through sophisticated metering systems operated by trained personnel.<br>
 It is highly corrosive, toxic, and very acidic, because of the H3O<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup>.<br>
 Operators of regulated public swimming pools may be required to install separate feeding equipment to add soda ash to neutralize the acidity from the chlorine gas.<br>
 If chlorine gas were the only chemical available to disinfect water, there would be few home swimming pools.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="18.7.2.2H"></a>18.7.2.2 Inorganic hypochlorites<br>
 Hypochlorites including calcium hypochlorite, sodium hypochlorite and lithium hypochlorite are used as a disinfectant, sanitizer, bactericide, algicide and oxidizer in swimming pool water.<br>
 Calcium hypochlorite is also used as a disinfectant in drinking water.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="18.7.2.2.1H"></a>18.7.2.2.1 Calcium hypochlorite, Ca(OCl)2<br>
 Calcium hypochlorite, in bleaching powder (30% chlorine), chlorinated lime (OXD 2208)<br>
Calcium hypochlorite, Ca(OCl)2, 65% available chlorine, white granular powder or compressed into pucks, pH 11.8, also contains 5 to 8% of insoluble material, which can cause cloudy water.<br>
 A by-product of this reaction is the calcium ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>), a major component of water hardness, and a contributor to scaling tendencies in the swimming pool.<br>
 Ca(OCl)2 + H2O, Ca<sup>2+</sup> + 2OCl<sup>-</sup> + H2O<br>
 calcium hypochlorite + water + calcium ion + hypochlorite ion + water.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="18.7.2.3H"></a>18.7.2.3 Chlorinated isocyanurates<br>
 Chlorinated isocyanurates, stabilized chlorine, are a group of chlorine swimming pool sanitizers that contain stabilizer (cyanuric acid or isocyanuric acid) as the granular form dichlor 56% available chlorine and the tablet or stick form trichlor 90% available chlorine, the latter usually used in a chlorine feeder.<br>
 Chemical feeder: a device that dispenses chemicals into the swimming pool water at a predetermined rate.<br>
 Some provide chlorine or bromine, while others add cyanuric acid (CNOH)3, also called conditioner and stabilizer.<br>
A granular chemical added to the swimming pool water, which provides a shield to chlorine for protection from the UV radiation from the sun.<br>
 It is also found in dichlor / trichlor products.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="18.7.2.4H"></a>18.7.2.4 Dichlor<br>
<a href="../images/16.13.8chd.gif">See diagram 16.13.8</a>: Trichloroisocyanuric acid, TCCA<br>
Trichloroisocyanuric acid, TCCA, C3Cl3N3O3, white crystalline powder, disinfectant, bleaching agent.<br>
 "Dichlor" is the common name for dichloroisocyanuric acid, C3HCl2N3O3, or the active ingredient in dichlor cleansing powder sodium dichloroisocyanurate C3Cl2N3NaO3.<br>
 Dichlor is a quick dissolving chlorine compound made up of chlorine and cyanuric acid (stabilizer) and has a pH of 6.9.<br>
 Shock treatment with dichlor is not recommended as it may result in over stabilization and chlorine lock.<br>
 If dichlor is used, a monthly check of the cyanuric acid level is recommended, to prevent over stabilization and chlorine lock.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="18.7.2.5H"></a>18.7.2.5 Chlorinating concentrates<br>
 Both the granular and tablets forms are based on cyanuric acid (CNOH)3, composed of alternating C and N atoms.<br>
 In the granular form two atoms of chlorine are added, giving an available chlorine of 56%.<br>
 It is a sodium salt, so it has excellent solubility at 26.1% w / v and a nearly neutral pH of 6.7.<br>
 It may be added directly to the swimming pool by hand broadcasting or it can be pre-dissolved and added as a hypochlorite solution.<br>
 The tablet form contains three atoms of chlorine, giving it 90% available Cl2.<br>
It has a relatively low pH of 2-3 and high available chlorine content, so much less needs to be added.<br>
 It has a minimal impact on pH and its low solubility of 1.2% w / v makes it ideal for use in tablet form in continuous feeding systems.<br>
 The trichloro product should not be added directly to the swimming pool in either its tablet or granular form, because its high available chlorine, slow solubility and acidic pH give it the potential to bleach, or pit any swimming pool surfaces.<br>
 Both products are free of insoluble residues, produce a minimal impact on pH and do not contribute to water hardness or scaling.<br>
 After the chlorine has been consumed in performing the sanitizing functions, the cyanuric acid remains dissolved in the water to provide maximum stabilization for the free chlorine residual.<br>
Secondary chemical treatment with substances that control pH and buffer the swimming pool, is also needed for swimmer comfort.<br>
Depending on swimming pool conditions, secondary treatment might include decolorizing, additional algicide, and chemicals to adjust mineral levels (hardness) or retard evaporation.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="18.2.7.6H"></a>18.2.7.6 Chlorinating tablets, chlorinating concentrate<br>
Pool chlorinating concentrates provide the effectiveness of HOCl, the ease and convenience of concentrated solids, and the benefits of stabilization, to provide outstanding water quality with minimum effort and expense.<br>
 Granular compounds react with water to produce the same active sanitizing species, hypochlorous acid.<br>
Therefore, it is an effective bactericide and algicide that will oxidize organic contaminants.<br>
 Tablets react similarly, but produce three units of hypochlorous acid.<br>
 Both the granular compounds and tablets have a by-product, cyanuric acid, which is supposed to stabilize free chlorine residual without interfering with its sanitizing effectiveness.<br>
 However, the binding action of cyanuric acid reduces the concentration of free available chlorine and demonstrably reduces sanitizer efficiency.<br>
 Pool owners who use cyanuric acid must have higher free residual chlorine to compensate for this fact so that sanitizer efficiency is maintained.<br>
 Some Australian States have banned the use of cyanuric acids.<br>
 So to describe cyanuric acid products as a "conditioner" is misleading.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="18.7.3H"></a>18.7.3 Hypochlorous acid, HOCl<br>
 Hypochlorous acid, HClO, is the active form of chlorine in swimming pool water.<br>
 Hypochlorous acid is a weak acid and dissociates poorly below pH 6, so it exists mainly as HOCl at low pH.<br>
 Between pH 6.0 and 8.5, a very sharp change occurs from undissociated HOCl to almost complete dissociation.<br>
 At 20<sup>o</sup>C and pH greater than 7.5, hypochlorite ions, OCl<sup>-</sup>, predominate.<br>
 HOCl is about 100 times more effective as a sanitizer than OCl<sup>-</sup>, because the negative charge on the OCl<sup>-</sup> ion hinders it entering living 
 cellular structures and oxidizing the contents.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="18.7.4.0H"></a>18.7.4.0 Tests for free chlorine in water<br>
 Free chlorine (free available chlorine, free residual chlorine, residual chlorine) is the amount of chlorine left in the swimming pool water after the chlorine demand has been satisfied.<br>
 It is the amount of free chlorine in the swimming pool water that is available to oxidize, sanitize or disinfect the water.<br>
Free chlorine is active chlorine and is not combined with any other molecule e.g. ammonia.<br>
 It is free to kill bacteria and algae in a swimming pool and is the chlorine available to do its job of sanitizing the water.<br>
 A portion of the free available chlorine is present as hypochlorous acid, which reacts to destroy organic material in the swimming pool water.<br>
 The standard method for determining free chlorine is to measure the amount of oxidant by its ability to liberate iodine from acidified iodide solution.<br>
 Titrate a water sample with a standard iodide solution and detect the iodine released by the blue colour formed with a fresh starch indicator.<br>
 Find the amount of iodine released by back titration with sodium thiosulfate, hypo.<br>
 The reagent is only oxidized to tetrathionate by the iodine.<br>
 With chlorine it is oxidized to sulfate.<br>
 HOCl + 2I<sup>-</sup> + H3O<sup>+</sup> --> Cl<sup>-</sup> + I2 + 2H2O<br>
 hypochlorous acid + iodide ion + hydronium ion --> chloride ion + iodine + water<br>
 I2 + 2S2O3<sup>2-</sup> --> S4O6<sup>2 -</sup>+ 2I<sup>-</sup><br>
iodine + thiosulfate ion --> tetrathionate ion + iodide ion<br>
Devices called rapid test meters can be used to test for chlorine and pH.<br>
 With a DPD test kit, DPD1 shows free available chlorine and DPD3 shows total chlorine.<br>
 The difference, if any, is the level of combined chlorine.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="18.7.5H"></a>18.7.5 Available chlorine<br>
 Available chlorine content is the term used to compare the amount of oxidizing power that products containing chlorine have compared to gas chlorine Cl2.<br>
 It permits easy comparison of relative values of chlorine compounds.<br>
 Available chlorine is the amount of free chlorine that is available to sanitize or disinfect the water.<br>
 It is also called Residual Chlorine and Free Available Chlorine.<br>
 When chlorine gas dissolves in water, it forms hydrochloric acid and hypochlorous acid.<br>
 Since only the hypochlorous acid sanitizes, only half the chlorine added to the water is usable.<br>
 Chlorine gas is defined as 100% available chlorine, so compounds for which all the chlorine in solution is active will have percentages twice the value based on composition.<br>
 Ca(OCl)2, which is 99.2% available chlorine for the pure material may be quoted as 100% available chlorine.<br>
 It produces two moles of active chlorine compared to only one mole from Cl2.<br>
 However, it has more than twice the molecular mass, a ratio of 143: 71.<br>
 So, on a mass basis, both chlorine gas and calcium hypochlorite are equally effective.<br>
 Materials releasing other oxidizing agents when dissolved in water have available chlorine defined in the same manner.<br>
 Approximate percentage available chlorine of substances added to swimming pool water are as follows:<br>
 Cl2 chlorine gas 100% (by definition)<br>
 Bleaching powder (chloride of lime) 35%<br>
 Ca(OCl)2 calcium hypochlorite 99%, industrial products 70%<br>
 NaOCl, sodium hypochlorite 95% (solution 100%)<br>
 Bleach (industrial product) 12%<br>
 Bleach (household product) 3%<br>
 ClO2, chlorine dioxide 263%<br>
 NH2Cl, monochloramine 138%<br>
 NHCl2, dichloramine 165%<br>
 CONClCONClCONCl, C3Cl3N3O3, trichloroisocyanuric acid 91%<br>
 CONClCONClCONH, dichloroisocyanuric acid 72%<br>
 CONClCONClCON<sup>-</sup>Na<sup>+, </sup> sodium dichloroisocyanurate 64%.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="18.7.6H"></a>18.7.6 Dissolve chlorine in swimming pool water by electrolysis<br>
Add common salt to water at concentration of approximately 4000 ppm to generate hypochlorous acid continuously with an electrolysis cell.<br>
The water will gradually become basic so you must add an acid to keep the pH between 7.2 and 7.8 for optimum swimmer comfort and to maintain sanitizer efficiency.<br>
Cathode (-) reaction: 2e<sup>-</sup> + 2H2O --> 2OH<sup>-</sup> + H2 (g)<br>
water --> hydroxyl ion + hydrogen gas<br>
Anode (+) reaction: 2Cl<sup>-</sup> --> Cl2 (g) + 2e<sup>-</sup><br>
chloride ion --> chlorine gas<br>
Overall Reaction: 2Cl<sup>-</sup> + 2H2O --> Cl2 (g) + H2 (g) + 2OH<sup>-</sup><br>
chloride ion + water --> chlorine gas + hydrogen gas + hydroxyl ion.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="18.7.7H"></a>18.7.7 Swimming pool water and pH<br>
 Lower the pH of the swimming pool below pH 7 to increase the oxidizing strength of the HOCl, but more acidic solutions will corrode many components .<br>
 For tiled swimming pools, the recommended pH range is pH 7.4-8.0 and you must add about 200 mg / L calcium chloride to offset removal of calcium salts from the grouting between the tiles.<br>
 A test for chlorine in water may measure the free residual chlorine or the free residual chlorine plus the chloramines, which are termed combined chlorine.<br>
 The lower the pH, the more readily chloramines form.<br>
 Above pH 7 few chloramines form, so keep the pH above 7.<br>

<a href="../images/13.4.2ch.gif">See diagram 13.4.2</a>: Chlorine dosage and residual chlorine for breakpoint chlorination.<br>
 Superchlorination is adding 7 to 10 times the normal dose of chlorine to the swimming pool water to destroy ammonia, nitrogen, chloramines and other contaminants.<br>
 Shock treatment is adding large amounts of an oxidizer such as chlorine, hydrogen peroxide or potassium peroxymonosulfate to the swimming pool water to destroy ammonia and nitrogen compounds, chloramines and other contaminants.<br>
 Superchlorination is used to get rid of chloramines.<br>
 When HOCl is added to pool water at first chloramines form by reaction with nitrogen compounds from humans.<br>
 With increased concentration of HOCl the chloramines are destroyed as in the following equation with the products being off-gassed.<br>
 However, with excess HOCl, the chlorine concentration in the water rises as chlorine no longer combines with organic compounds.<br>
 2NH3 + 3HOCl --> N2 (g) + 3HCl + 3H2O<br>
 ammonia gas + hypochlorous acid --> nitrogen gas + hydrochloric acid + water<br>
 When chlorine in its various forms is added to water, it is used up in oxidizing any material for which it is a sufficiently strong oxidizing agent, e.g. iron II, sulfide, nitrite.<br>
 Next, chloramines, called combined chlorine, form from reactions of chlorine with organic nitrogen compounds.<br>
 The breakpoint when further addition of chlorine is not used to oxidize nitrogenous compounds, but remains as free available chlorine.<br>
 When you superchlorinate or shock treat the swimming pool, the goal is to reach a high enough level of free chlorine to break apart.<br>
 All molecular bonds, specifically the combined chlorine molecules, ammonia or nitrogen compounds and to completely oxidize all organic matter.<br>
 If you add enough chlorine to achieve this breakpoint chlorination, chlorine added after that point will be free available chlorine.<br>
Superchlorination refers to further additions of chlorine that will remain in the water as residual chlorine to react with any material later added to the swimming pool water.<br>
 Maintain a free chlorine residual at all times to achieve sparkling clear, sanitary swimming pool water by periodic super chlorination of the swimming pool water.<br>
 When chloramines are removed, better efficiency of chlorine is achieved.<br>
 More of the chlorine residual can then exist as the free or active form, rather than as the less effective combined form.<br>
 You can use potassium monopersulfate for strong oxidation reactions to oxidize any chloride ion back to chlorine.<br>
Superchlorination is the remedial action that should be taken when the DPD test detects the presence of 0.2 ppm or greater of combined chlorine in the swimming pool.<br>
 Superchlorination simply involves the addition of 5 to 10 × normal daily dose of chlorine.<br>
Super chlorination should be routinely performed on very hot days under heavy loads after heavy rains or if DPD test shows combined chlorine in excess of 0.2 ppm combined chlorine.<br>
 Superchlorination is a remedial action and is recommended to remove gross amounts of chloramines, correct eye and nasal discomfort, or destroy a visible algae growth.<br>
 It also eliminates waiting, vacuuming, scrubbing and back washing to remove algae appeared while chloramines accumulated.<br>
 However, although it works well, eventually if you keep loading chemicals and contaminants in a swimming pool you problems.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="18.7.9H"></a>18.7.9 Alkalinity, total alkalinity and buffer capacity<br>
<a href="../images/13.4.2ch.gif">See diagram 13.4.2</a>: Titration of sodium carbonate with hydrochloric acid.<br>
Alkalinity is the total amount of dissolved alkaline compounds in swimming pool water.<br>
 Alkalinity is used a measure of the buffer capacity of swimming pool water, i.e. the resistance to change in the pH of water when strong acids or bases are added.<br>
 If the alkalinity is too low, pH control is difficult, because the pH is sensitive to small amounts of acid and base.<br>
 Calculate how much 0.1 M hydrochloric acid would be needed to change the pH by one unit if there is no buffering capacity.<br>
 The pH 8.4 of sodium bicarbonate in water lies between the pK values of the first and second dissociation constants of carbonic acid, 3.60 and 10.25.<br>
 Carbon dioxide constitutes about 0.033% of the atmosphere and dissolves in rainwater to form carbonic acid and produce theoretical pH value pH 5.65.<br>
 Carbonic acid has two acidic hydrogens and hence has two dissociation constants, PKa1 and PKa2.<br>
 H2O (l) --> H<sup>+</sup> (aq) + OH<sup>-</sup> (aq)<br>
 2H<sup>+</sup> (aq) + CO3<sup>2-</sup> (aq) --> H2CO3 (aq) carbonic acid<br>
 CO2 + H2O --> H3O<sup>+</sup> + HCO3<sup>-</sup><br>
 HCO3<sup>-</sup> + H2O --> H3O<sup>+</sup> + CO3<sup>2-</sup><br>
 CO2 + H2O --> H2CO3 carbonic acid<br>
 H2CO3 --> HCO3<sup>-</sup> + H<sup>+</sup><br>
 Ka1 2.5 × 10<sup>-4</sup> mol / L, Pka1 3.60<br>
 HCO3<sup>-</sup> --> CO3<sup>2-</sup> + H<sup>+</sup><br>
 Ka2 5.61 × 10<sup>-11</sup> mol / L, PKa2 10.25<br>
 Total equation: CO2 + H2O --> HCO3<sup>-</sup> + H<sup>+<br>
</sup>Total equation KA = 4.30 × 10<sup>-7</sup>, PKa = 6.36, but call this value the acidity constant.<br>
 Total alkalinity is a measure of the buffering capacity of swimming pool water, i.e. resistance to change in pH of the water when acid is added.<br>
 It is usually expressed as carbonate alkalinity, the total amount of alkaline materials present in the water, principally hydroxides, carbonates and bicarbonates.<br>
 Control of pH can be simplified by maintaining total alkalinity in the range of 80 to 150 ppm.<br>
 Total alkalinity is composed of carbonates, bicarbonates, and hydroxides, and functions as a buffer to help keep pH in the proper range.<br>
 Total alkalinity is easily measured with a test kit, and can be adjusted with alkalinity control or acid according to label directions.<br>
 When you measure the total alkalinity, only measure the carbonate alkalinity level.<br>
 The term "alkalinity" comes from the common use of sodium bicarbonate as a buffer and its alkaline pH of 8.4.<br>
 However, you can also use acid buffers and so "buffer capacity" may be a better term than "alkalinity".<br>
 If the swimming pool has an unstable pH, the total alkalinity should be tested and adjusted.<br>
 The ideal total alkalinity range for swimming pools containing either calcium or sodium hypochlorite is between 60 and 120 mg / L with the optimum between 80 and 100 mg / L.<br>
 Total alkalinity too low<br>
 A swimming pool with low alkalinity, below 60 mg / L, will require the addition of a little acid to cause a rapid reduction in pH.<br>
 A constant pH in low alkalinity water is difficult to maintain after rain.<br>
Low buffering capacity causes corrosion and pH bounce, i.e. the pH resumes previous levels soon after adjustment, because the buffering capacity is too low.<br>
 Raise total alkalinity by addition of an alkalinity control base, e.g. sodium bicarbonate, that in turn increases the buffering capacity of the swimming pool.<br>
 To raise alkalinity with sodium bicarbonate, the dosage calculation is based on tables prepared for the swimming pool industry.<br>
 For example, a 25 000 L swimming pool would need 445 g of 57% sodium bicarbonate to increase alkalinity by 10 mg / L.<br>
 You can add 80 to 120 mg / kg of the white powder sodium bicarbonate as a buffering agent to raise the total alkalinity of swimming pool water without having much affect on pH.<br>
 It will only increase pH up to 8.4, regardless of the quantity used.<br>
 Avoid adding large quantities at one time.<br>
 Total alkalinity too high, 
 A swimming pool with high alkalinity, over 120 mg / L, requires the addition of large quantities of acid to produce a drop in pH.<br>
 It will tend to retain pH in most conditions and cause staining, scale deposits and difficulty in adjusting pH.<br>
High buffer capacity requires large amounts of acid or base to change the pH of the solution.<br>
 If the pH rises rapidly even after the addition of large amounts of acid, the buffering capacity is too high.<br>
 Reduce total alkalinity to 80 ppm by addition of granular addition of PH minus or hydrochloric acid (muriatic acid) or sodium bisulfate (sodium bisulfate, sodium hydrogen sulfate) granular dry acid, a dry white crystal that is safer to handle than hydrochloric acid.<br>
To lower alkalinity with hydrochloric acid or sodium bisulfate, the dosage calculation uses tables to find the volume of hydrochloric acid required to lower alkalinity.<br>
 The weight of sodium bisulfate, dry acid, required is found by multiplying the volume of hydrochloric acid by 1.2.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="18.7.10H"></a>18.7.10 Adjusting the pH of swimming pool water<br>
 The ideal range for pH in swimming pools is 7.0 to 7.6.<br>
 The pH of human tears is 7.2 to 7.4.<br>
 Measure the pH with an indicator that changes colour at a suitable pH.<br>
 The indicator is a weak acid that shifts from one colour to the other just as hypochlorous acid shifts from HOCl to OCl<sup>-</sup>.<br>
 Use an indicator with the same pKa as hypochlorous acid.<br>
 The pH of natural water is about pH 5.6, because dissolved carbon dioxide from the air forms carbonic acid that lowers the pH.<br>
 The continuous addition of hypochlorite powder will raise the pH, so you must add "swimming pool acid" after some time, 
 e.g. the solid "swimming pool acid" sodium hydrogen sulfate, NaHSO4.<br>
 You can add hydrochloric acid to salt water swimming pools with electrolyzers.<br>
 A neutralizer is a chemical used to deactivate or destroy chlorine or bromine used in better test kits to increase the accuracy of the swimming pool water tests.<br>
 Base demand is a titration test used to find the amount of a base (alkali) required to increase the pH to the correct level.<br>
 Base demand determined by a titration to find the amount of a base (alkali) required to increase the pH to the correct level.<br>
 Sodium bicarbonate is used as a base to raise the pH, but sodium carbonate is more effective and more commonly used.<br>
 The adding of sodium bicarbonate to water gives pH 8.4, but adding sodium carbonate to water gives pH 11.6.<br>
 The addition of acid changes the pH according to the titration curve diagram.<br>
 The pH of swimming pool water may be changed from pH 7.2 to 7.8 by rain, dust, swimmer wastes and addition of sanitizer.<br>
However, a stabilized granular form of sanitizer, with a pH of between 6 and 7, will have little effect on the pH of swimming pools.<br>
 Stabilized swimming pool chlorine tablets, although low in pH, have a minimal effect on pH, because their high available chlorine and 
 stabilization means far less is needed to provide effective sanitation.<br>
 Chlorine gas, calcium hypochlorite, and liquid bleach all require greater pH adjustment, because their pH is far from the desired operating range of pH range 7.2 to 7.8.<br>
 This pH range must be maintained, because of its impact on sanitizer efficiency, swimmer comfort, corrosion and scaling.<br>
Since total alkalinity affects the amount of pH adjusting chemical added, it should first be adjusted to the 80-125 ppm range.<br>
 After adjusting swimming pool chemistry, pH balance should be checked with pH adjusting chemicals to protect chlorine from UV rays.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="18.7.11H"></a>18.7.11 Oxidizing agents<br>
<a href="../images/13.4.2ch.gif">See diagram 13.4.2</a>: Reduction potential of chlorine in water and pH.<br>
 The ability of a material to oxidize is measured by the standard half-cell reduction potential, in volts.<br>
 This is an equilibrium value given for very specific conditions and so gives only a general indication for a practical situation.<br>
 The larger the half-cell reduction potential, the stronger the oxidizing agent.<br>
 The standard electrode potentials, E<sup>0</sup> are reference to a standard electrode, usually the hydrogen electrode, which is arbitrary defined as 0 V.<br>
 The oxidizing agent HOCl is stronger than OCl<sup>-</sup>.<br>
 HOCL + H3O<sup>+</sup> + 2e<sup>-</sup> &lt; = &gt; Cl<sup>-</sup> + 2H2O, E<sup>0</sup> = 1.49 V<br>
 ClO<sup>-</sup>+ 2H2O + 2e<sup>-</sup> &lt; = &gt; Cl<sup>-</sup> + 2OH<sup>-</sup>, E<sup>0</sup> = 0.94 V<br>
 It is dangerous to store hypochlorite powder swimming pool chlorine near materials that can burn, because it is a strong oxidizing agent.<br>
If the material comes in contact with something that can be oxidized with chlorine, e.g. brake fluid, then a fire can occur.<br>
 Chlorine gas is released when solid hypochlorite powder comes in contact with moisture at any pH.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="18.7.12H"></a>18.7.12 Chlorine levels in swimming pools<br>
Free chlorine must remain in the swimming pool after all the organic material has been oxidized, so measuring free chlorine is necessary.<br>
 This is usually done with test kits, e.g. using OTO, ortho-tolidine (4,4'-diamino-3,3'-dimethylbiphenyl) or DPD  (Diethyl-paraphenylene diamine).<br>
 A chemical reagent used to test the total chlorine level in water at normal temperatures.<br>
 It can measure free available chlorine if the water is first cooled to 1<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 Its results depend on pH, time and concentration of chlorine.<br>
 Because of its toxicity, the use of OTO is restricted or prohibited in many western countries.<br>
 It is chemically similar to benzidine without the methyl groups, a bladder carcinogen.<br>
 The colour test with chlorine works well with laboratory solutions of chlorine in water.<br>
 The reagent also reacts slowly with chloramines, the compounds that chlorine forms when reacting with nitrogenous body waste products in swimming pools.<br>
 So the free chlorine must be measured above what has reacted with waste otherwise under dosing of chlorine may cause ear, eye and throat infections increases, because insufficient free chlorine exists in solution.<br>
 Breakpoint chlorination occurs when free chlorine and combined chlorine are simultaneously minimized.<br>
 Addition of further chlorine gives free chlorine.<br>
 Beyond which point nitrogenous compounds have been oxidized, principally to nitrogen gas.<br>
 The methyl orange test measures free residual chlorine (HOCl + OCl<sup>-</sup>), but the OTO test kit measures the combined chlorine, as well, but you must do the test quickly.<br>
 Add chlorine solution to ammonia to form chloramines.<br>
 Make a stock solution of 0.2 g of Ca(OCl)2 per litre (1.78 × 10<sup>-3</sup> M) as stock solution.<br>
 Dilute by a factor of five for use (3.5 × 10<sup>-6</sup> M or 25 mg /kg Cl2 equivalent).<br>
 Add the stock solution in 20 mL aliquots to 1 mL of 0.015 M NH3 solution (255 mg / kg).<br>
 A concentrated ammonia solution keeps the volumes almost constant.<br>
 Test with indicators.<br>
 Methyl orange will not bleach until about 2 mole equivalents of chlorine have been added (about 80 mL), and free HOCL is present.<br>
 OTO, on the other hand, will show off scale from the beginning, indicating reaction with chloramines as well.<br>
 Note the time taken by the oxidation reactions.<br>
 Measure a chlorine solution as a control to monitor any loss of chlorine.<br>
 Chlorine meters do not measure HOCl concentration.<br>
 They measure ORP and via an algorithm approximate HOCL concentration.<br>
 The reading may be unreliable.<br>

<a href="../images/13.4.2ch.gif">See diagram 13.4.2</a>: Ultraviolet absorption spectrum of swimming pool chlorine.<br>
 Reports suggest that in strong sunlight, up to half of the HOCl is destroyed within 17 minutes.<br>
 Chlorinated sanitizer will produce HOCl, but up to 97% of that residual can be lost in 2 hours so when 4-5 ppm of free available chlorine is added as calcium hypochlorite at 6 am, it will be completely gone<br>by 12 noon, whether or not anyone uses the swimming pool.<br>
 This same wasteful chlorine consumption occurs with chlorine gas and sodium hypochlorite.<br>
 The free available chlorine residual could be maintained by testing the water at noon, adding another 4-5 ppm residual for safe afternoon swimming, then repeat the process at 6 pm to use the swimming pool in the evening or install a chemical feeding system to constantly add sanitizer.<br>

<a href="../images/16.13.8chd.gif">See diagram 16.13.8</a>: Dichlorocyanuric acid, "dichlor".<br>

 cyanuric acid + hypochlorite ion, dichlorcyanuric acid + hydroxide ion<br>
 Stabilizer: also called cyanuric acid or conditioner.<br>
 A granular chemical added to the swimming pool water that provides a shield to chlorine for protection from UV radiation.<br>
 Too much can result in chlorine lock.<br>
 Cyanuric acid can stabilize chlorine in swimming pools by protecting chlorine in the water against the effects of the UV rays from the sun.<br>
 Cyanuric acid is made by heating urea or some of its derivatives.<br>
 It is a selective herbicide, very toxic to barley and radishes.<br>
 It reacts with chlorine to give dichloro(iso)cyanuric acid in a chemical equilibrium.<br>
 Stabilize swimming pool chlorine by using cyanuric acid at a minimum concentration of 30 parts per million, ppm.<br>
 (1 ppm = 1 mg per litre.)<br>
 In the stabilization process, a portion of the chlorine residual is temporarily bonded to the cyanuric acid molecule and protected from the destructive effects of sunlight.<br>
 The nature of this bond is such that the chlorine demand is imposed upon the system and continues to be released as long as a demand exists.<br>
 As OCl<sup>-</sup> or HOCl is used up in the swimming pool more OCl<sup>-</sup> is released from the dichloro(iso)cyanuric acid to re-establish the 
 equilibrium to maintain a constant amount of chlorine in the swimming pool.<br>
 Other industrial chemicals are trichlorocyanuric acid and sodium dichlorocyanuric acid.<br>
 The amount of cyanuric acid is kept constant in the swimming pool between 30 and 80 mg / L by the initial addition of any of the three compounds then only hypochlorite should be added to keep the level of free chlorine at 2 mg / L.<br>
 The equilibrium in the reaction stabilizes the concentration of OCl<sup>-</sup>.<br>
 If excess cyanuric acid is used, the chlorocyanuric acids do not absorb the ultraviolet light from the sun.<br>
 To find the level of cyanuric acid in the swimming pool a reaction with melamine forms a salt that precipitates and scatters light.<br>
 The turbidity is proportional to the amount of cyanuric acid.<br>
 The turbidity is measured by the depth of solution required in a standard Nessler tube to just obliterate an object at the bottom of the tube.<br>
 Anionic surfactants are measured by a similar salt formation chlorine using methylene blue.<br>
 The salts formed are sufficiently lyophilic to transfer into organic solvents and to be estimated by the depth of colour in the organic solvent.<br>
 C3H3N3O3 + C3H6N6 --> C3H3N3O3.C3H6N6<br>
 cyanuric acid + melamine --> melamine cyanurate (melamine cyanuric acid precipitate)<br>
 The test can be done with a small test-tube and a calibrated stick with a black spot on the end.<br>
 The divisions on the stick where depth of spot seen is calibrated with cyanuric acid concentration in ppm, follow Beer's law, 
 Concentration = Ke<sup>-a Depth</sup>.<br>
 During a swimming pool season, the conditioner may decrease from leakage, swimmer activity causing splash out or drag out, and maintenance operations, e.g. vacuuming and filter back washing.<br>
 Because of the slightly acidic pH of conditioner, addition of a small quantity of PH plus or acid may be necessary to maintain pH at the desired level.<br>
 If the conditioner concentration is too high, it can be lowered by dilution with fresh top up water.<br>
 The CYA stabilizer reduces the free chlorine, which is what does the sanitizing, and hence more must be added to maintain free chlorine and an ORP within the range 650 mV to 750 mV.<br>
 Swimming pools not exposed to the sun, e.g. indoor swimming pools should not be treated with CYA.<br>
 Some Australian State governments have banned the use of CYA in swimming pools.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="18.7.15H"></a>18.7.15 Algicides, control of algae in swimming pools<br>
 If a swimming pool has an algae problem first vacuum and backwash, then breakpoint chlorinate.<br>
 Use an algicide as a last resort.<br>
 Algae is the most common fouler of swimming pools, because it is propagated by air-borne spores.<br>
 When conditions favour their growth, e.g. heavy rain, intense sunlight, and presence of nitrogenous materials, they can cause black and green spots on swimming pool walls and form an algae bloom in the water, resulting in a sharp rise in pH, as the algae consume carbon dioxide in the swimming pool water.<br>
 If algae bloom is present, use superchlorination followed by an algicide to control it and prevent its reoccurrence.<br>
 Algicides should be used as a backup to a routine sanitation program.<br>
 Maintain a free chlorine residual in the swimming pool by sanitizing with stabilized swimming pool chlorinating concentrates and adding algicide according to the directions on the label.<br>
 Algae do not cause disease, but may provide an ideal substrate for bacteria.<br>
 Algicides as liquids or granules include copper and silver compounds, Quat compounds, chlorine enhancer and herbicides.<br>
They may be obtained formulated for a specific type of algae, e.g. green algae, mustard algae, blue-green algae, black algae (black spot), the hardest to treat, and be a bactericide.<br>
 Pink algae or red algae-like organisms may be a bacteria.<br>
Chelated copper algicides that contain an ingredient to prevent the copper from staining the swimming pool surfaces or producing coloured water, but do not affect the ability of copper to kill algae.<br>
 Copper may also be used in the equipment and plumbing in swimming pools.<br>
Copper (II) sulfate was one of the original copper algicides as with aluminium sulfate it also provides a flocculent.<br>
 However, it may harm some aquatic creatures in natural swimming pools and stain solids in swimming pools.<br>
 Small concentrations of copper or silver ions produced by electrolysis can be effective.<br>
 Materials similar to cationic surfactants are also used as algicides.<br>
 In addition to getting rid of algae, algicides extend the effectiveness of chlorine residual.<br>
 While chlorine is an algicide, add additional quantities as a backup, a maintenance dose.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="18.7.15.1H"></a>18.7.15.1 Green hair and faded hair from swimming pools<br>
 Low calcium ion level, with low pH and high levels of copper and chlorine from cheaper copper-based algicide, overuse of this algicide or corrosive water may cause green hair, blue fingernails, green, brown or blue water, stained swimming pool surfaces, and leaching of copper from copper pipes, copper heating elements and bronze pump impellers.<br>
 It is not the chlorine that bleaches hair.<br>
 Oxidized metals in the water bind to the protein in the hair shaft and deposit their colour.<br>
 The copper in algicide turns blond hair green.<br>
 Bleach added to a swimming pool may oxidize the copper, but the bleach itself is not the cause of the colour.<br>
 The green precipitate is a mixture of copper sulfate and copper hydroxide and is most noticeable in blond hair and especially bleached hair where the hair shaft may lack the natural oils that reduce water absorption.<br>
 To remove the green tint in hair, 1. Use folk remedies, e.g. wash the hair in aspirin, tomato juice, lemon juice, baking soda, Alka Seltzer, high pH shampoo.<br>
 2. Rinse the hair immediately after leaving the swimming pool.<br>
 3. Use a shampoo that chelates the copper.<br>
 Before swimming, prevent copper from binding to the hair by sealing the hair cuticle with a hair conditioner.<br>
Swimming pool chemicals, especially chlorine and bromine, react with the sebum and oils that protect the hair, leaving the hair's cuticle exposed.<br>
 This allows other chemicals to react with the hair, such as copper compounds, which can give the hair a greenish tint.<br>
 Hair also becomes more susceptible to damage from the ultraviolet rays of sunlight that break the bonds in keratin the protein in the hair to cause roughness and split ends.<br>
 Pigment molecules also succumb to swimming pool chemicals and the sun, so even if the hair does not turn green, it can become lighter or faded.<br>
 The best way to prevent swimmers hair is to keep the swimming pool water from soaking into the hair with a swim cap.<br>
 Limit exposure to swimming pool water by taking only occasional dips, not letting the hair get wet, and by showering after leaving the swimming pool.<br>
 The best treatment is to use a shampoo, but even a quick rinse in fresh water will help remove the swimming pool chemicals.<br>
Follow up with a conditioner to seal the cuticle of the hair's cuticle and replenish its protective coating.<br>
 Healthy hair is less susceptible to swimmers hair than hair that already has damage.<br>
 Also, coloured, permed or heat-treated hair is at greater risk for dryness and colour loss from swimming than untreated hair.<br>
 If you swim a lot, reduce hair processing and keep up the cut so that chlorine will not get in through split ends.<br>
 A special shampoo made just for swimmers may contain ingredients that will chelate copper and other metals so that they do not discolour the hair.<br>
The shampoo may leave a waxy coating on the hair to prevent it from soaking up swimming pool water.<br>
 Another shampoo is a clarifying shampoo to prevent build-ups that can weigh the hair down and dull its shine.<br>
 Another option is to use a regular shampoo and follow-up with a leave-in conditioner that contains a UV filter that give protection from both the sun and the swimming pool water.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="18.7.16H"></a>18.7.16 Total dissolved solids (TDS) water hardness, scale<br>
 Total Dissolved Solids, TDS, are a measure of all the dissolved chemicals in the water, whether they are natural components of source water, residues of treatment chemicals, swimmers wastes, or wind and rain borne atmospheric pollutants.<br>
They stay in the water and may cause staining, scaling and reduced chlorine efficiency, if allowed to accumulate beyond recommended limits.<br>
 All swimming pool water contains total dissolved solids.<br>
 Stabilizing and using chloroisocyanurate produces the least amount of TDS.<br>
 It is estimated that TDS should be maintained at less than 1500 ppm.<br>
 Cyanuric acid causes no ill effects in swimming pool water, but that it may, by accumulation, indicates the onset of problems, because of TDS in the swimming pool.<br>
 The only practical way to remove dissolved solids from a swimming pool is to remove a portion of the water in which they are dissolved.<br>
 The recommended rate of water removal per week is 1 to 3%.<br>
 In a 10 000 gallon swimming pool, this represents 100 gallons per week.<br>
 Hardness, total hardness is a measure of the calcium and magnesium content of the water.<br>
 All water contains some natural hardness.<br>
 The amount will vary regionally, and from source to source.<br>
 Calcium hardness refers to the calcium content of the water.<br>
 If the calcium hardness level is too low, the water may be corrosive and attack the materials of construction.<br>
 So a certain amount of hardness is necessary in water to control its tendency to dissolve.<br>
 Hardness treatment will increase low water hardness and prevent etching, pitting and corrosion of surfaces and metallic components.<br>
The soluble white salt calcium chloride is used to raise the calcium hardness or total hardness level of swimming pool water.<br>
If the calcium hardness level is too high, the water may have a tendency to form scale visible as crusty grey deposits and cloudy water 
 or deposits in piping that will y not function properly if their diameters are decreased by scale formation.<br>
 Scale on swimming pool surfaces is unsightly and unattractive.<br>
 Scale is formed from calcium carbonate crystals when the calcium hardness, pH or total alkalinity levels are too high.<br>

 Assess the cost at, say, 1.5 KW for 6 hours for 4 months and 1.5 KW for 4 hours for 8 months at $0.12 per kWh.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="18.7.18H"></a>18.7.18 Stabilized and unstabilized swimming pools<br>
 In swimming pool waters, the free chlorine, HOCl, may be consumed by the following:<br>
 1. Destroying bacteria and algae introduced by swimmers and by wind and rain borne contamination,<br>
 2. Reacting with reduced metals such as Fe<sup>2+</sup> to produce the oxidized Fe<sup>3+</sup> and chlorine ions,<br>
 3. Action of the ultraviolet energy of sunlight that converts free available chlorine to the inactive chloride ion,<br>
 4. Oxidizing nitrogenous compounds such as ammonia NH3 and urea introduced into the water as components of perspiration, urine and other bodily excretions.<br>
 Maintenance of free available chlorine residual at 1 ppm to 3 ppm.<br>
 Pre-conditioning the swimming pool with 30 ppm of conditioner, and using a sanitizer to maintain that minimum, automatically provides protection for a swimming pool against the effects of sunlight.<br>
 Most overseas countries require swimming pool operators to measure free chlorine and ORP.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="18.7.19H"></a>18.7.19 Bromine products, HBrO<br>
 Bromine is a halogen family used as a sanitizer or disinfectant to destroy bacteria and algae in swimming pools and spas.<br>
 It is resistant to heat and rapid pH fluctuations and is available as a tablet or as sodium bromide "bromide", a granular salt.<br>
 BCDMH (bromochlorodimethylhydantoin) is a bromine sanitizer.<br>
 When BCDMH dissolves in water, it produces hypobromous acid, HBrO, the active form of bromine in swimming pool water.<br>
 Bromamines are by-products formed when bromine reacts with nitrogenous compounds including swimmer waste.<br>
 Unlike chloramines, which are strong smelling and have low sanitizing properties, bromamines are active disinfectants and do not smell, although high levels are harmful to health.<br>
 A brominator is a mechanical or electrical device for dispensing bromine at a controlled rate from a floater filled with bromine sanitizer tablets.<br>
 Sodium bromide is used to raise the bromine levels in a swimming pool before using bromine tablets.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="18.7.20H"></a>18.7.20 Filters<br>
 The three main types of swimming pool filters used in swimming pools are sand filters, cartridge filters and diatomaceous earth, DE filters.<br>
 Filter aids include the clarifiers, flocculents and coagulants that are the inorganic salts of aluminium (alum) or organic polyelectrolytes, and diatomaceous earth, called filter powder.<br>
 Sand filters use hard sharp silica or quartz or the zeolite clinoptilolite.<br>
 Filter micron size is in a unit of length equal to 1 millionth of a metre.<br>
 Microns are used to describe the pore size of swimming pool filter media.<br>
 Sand filters have openings of 25 to 30 microns, cartridge filters have openings of 8 to 16 microns, and DE (diatomaceous earth) filters have openings of 1 to 5 microns.<br>
 Zeolite used in sand filters have openings of 3 to 6 microns.<br>
 Flocculents, e.g. alum, and coagulants cause minute particles to clump together to be trapped by the filter or fall to the bottom as "floc".<br>
 Flocculent are also used to clarify muddy swimming pool water with the charged aluminium ion from alum.<br>
 Aluminium ion is also used in sticks to coagulate blood from shaving cuts and in antiperspirants to coagulate sweat from pores under the arm.<br>
 Alum sinks everything to the bottom to be vacuumed to waste and a small amount of alum can also be used as a sand filter additive.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="18.7.21.0H"></a>18.7.21.0 Test kit for chlorine levels in swimming pools<br>
A test kit is a manual or electrical device used to measure specific chemical residuals, levels or demands in swimming pool water.<br>
 Kits usually contain reagents, vials, titrants and colour comparators for the tests.<br>
 The most common tests are as follows: pH, free available chlorine, combined chlorine, total alkalinity, calcium hardness, cyanuric acid and metals.<br>
 Test strips are small plastic strips with pads attached that have been impregnated with reagents to test swimming pool water.<br>
 The strips are dipped into the water and the resulting colours are compared to a colour scale to find the values.<br>
 Balanced water is the result when all the chemical parameters are within the tolerance limits.<br>
 The most important parameters of water balance are pH, total alkalinity, calcium hardness and temperature, as measured using the Langelier Saturation Index.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="18.7.21.1H"></a>18.7.21.1 Acid demand of swimming pools<br>
 Acid demand is the amount of acid required to bring high pH or total alkalinity down to their proper levels is determined by an acid demand test.<br>
 The acid demand test is a reagent test usually used in conjunction with a pH test to find the amount of acid needed to lower pH or total alkalinity.<br>
Acid demand is the amount of acid that needs to be added to swimming pool water to lower the pH and total alkalinity to acceptable levels.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="18.7.21.3H"></a>18.7.21.3 Methyl orange test for chlorine in swimming pools<br>
 Free chlorine bleaches methyl orange solution quantitatively<br>
 Make a stock solution of methyl orange:<br>
 Dissolve 0.05 g methyl orange in 100 mL of water.<br>
 Make a standard solution: Add 0.2 g NaCl to 10 mL of stock solution then dilute to 100 mL.<br>
 Swimming pools will have different amounts of dissolved salt depending on their treatment history.<br>
 The addition of 0.2 g of NaCl is an attempt to ensure roughly the same ionic strength of the test sample as this may affect the accuracy of the measurement.<br>
 The reagent appears to be stable in the dark for years.<br>
 Make a test solution: Add 3 mL of 6 M hydrochloric acid to 24 mL of standard methyl orange solution.<br>
 Step 1: Put 0.25 mL of test solution in a test-tube.<br>
 Add 10 mL of swimming pool water.<br>
 1.1 It decolorizes instantly so at least 1 mg / kg chlorine present.<br>
 1.2 It does not decolorize instantly so insufficient chlorine in the swimming pool.<br>
 Add more chlorine to the swimming pool and repeat the test.<br>
 Step 2: Put 0.5 mL of test solution in a test-tube.<br>
 Add 10 mL of swimming pool water.<br>
 2.1 It decolorizes instantly so at least 1.5 mg / kg chlorine present.<br>
 2.2 It does not decolorize instantly.<br>
 The swimming pool contains between 1.0 and present.<br>
 1.5 mg / kg of chlorine.<br>
 This is the best concentration.<br>
 Step 3: Put 0.75 mL of test solution in a test-tube.<br>
 Add 10 mL of swimming pool water.<br>
 3.1 It decolorizes instantly so at least 1.75 mg / kg chlorine present.<br>
 3.2 It does not decolorize instantly.<br>
 The swimming pool contains between 1.5 and 1.75 mg / kg of chlorine.<br>
 This concentration is too high.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="18.7.21.5H"></a>18.7.21.5 OTO test for swimming pools<br>
(OTO, ortho-tolidine, ortho-toluidine, o-Toluidine, 2-Aminotoluene, 2-Methylaniline, CH3C6H4NH2)<br>
 The OTO test kit is seen as unreliable and is no longer used extensively.<br>
 If you find a yellow colour in the comparator and a clear liquid reagent, then it is clear that this swimming pool is being tested by the orthotolidine, or OTO method.<br>
 The OTO method has some advantages that have made it popular and widely used.<br>
 It also has some major deficiencies.<br>
 OTO reacts easily with hypochlorite, but reacts more slowly with chloramines, so does not reliably measure "free chlorine", the chlorine in the form of OCl<sup>-</sup> and HOCl.<br>
 The fact that it cannot easily distinguish free from combined chlorine makes it a very doubtful aid to swimming pool operation.<br>
 Even worse, it creates a false sense of security, leading to erroneous diagnosis of swimming pool problems, which delays remedial action.<br>
 The swimming pool owner could test once, twice, or three times daily and still have no idea whether enough free available chlorine was present to protect the quality of the water.<br>
 A 1 ppm residual measured by OTO will provide far less protection to swimming pool than a 1 ppm residual measured by the DPD method.<br>
 Ortho-toluidine may be carcinogenic.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="18.7.21.6H"></a>18.7.21.6 DPD test for swimming pools<br>
 DPD, N,N-Diethyl-P-phenylenediamine, C10H16N2, (C2H5)2NC6H4NH2<br>
 DPD is an indicator reagent used to measure free available chlorine (DPD1) and total chlorine (DPD3) bromine, ozone and other oxidizers in water.<br>
 DPD is far superior to OTO.<br>
 The efficacy of chlorine is affected by many factors, including the sun, temperature, water balance and the chlorine demand of the water.<br>
 DPD, is the phenylenediamine used to determine chlorine in water.<br>
 DPD free chlorine reagent powder pillows, DPD No. 1 tablets, DPD No. 3 tablets<br>
 DPD total chlorine reagent powder pillows.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">1. In the DPD calorimetric method to measure total free chlorine, the intensity of the colour is directly proportional to the amount of 
 chlorine present in the sample.<br>
 When DPD is added, the chlorine oxidizes it to magenta-coloured "Wurster Dye", and colourless imine compound.<br>
 However, the test does not differentiate between the two forms of free chlorine: HOCl, and OCl<sup>-</sup> and at high pH gives an inaccurate reading.<br>
 DPD is a 2<sup>+</sup> cation (NH3<sup>+</sup> and N<sup>+</sup>H), e.g. AQUANAL, often as a sodium salt.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">2. Measure chlorine levels in the range 0 -2 ppm by simple colour comparison<br>
 colourless DPD amine cation + Cl2 --> magenta colour Wurster dye free radical cation + colourless imine cation.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">3. Measure "combined chlorine" as monochloramine, NH2Cl and dichloramine, NHCl2,<br>
 3.1 To measure monochloramine, add 0.1 mg KI to a 10 mL test sample acidified to pH 6.2 to 6.5<br>
 NH2Cl + 3I<sup>-</sup> + H2O + H<sup>+</sup> --> NH4OH + Cl<sup>-</sup> + I3<sup>-</sup><br>
 Then the I3<sup>-</sup> (and free chlorine in the sample) forms the magenta Wurster dye<br>
 3.2 To measure the dichloramine, add &gt;0.1 g of KI to the 10 L sample<br>
 NHCl2 + 3I<sup>-</sup> + H2O + 2H<sup>+</sup> --> NH4OH + 2Cl<sup>-</sup> + I3<sup>-</sup><br>
 This last reaction gives total chlorine in the sample so the dichloamine is measured by subtraction.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">4. When DPD, is added to the sample, chlorine oxidizes the DPD to form two possible oxidation<br>
 product, magenta coloured compound called Wurster Dye, and a colourless imine compound.<br>
 When small amounts of chlorine react, Wurster Dye is the favoured product.<br>
 When high levels of chlorine react the colourless imine compound is favoured, leading to the apparent fading of the solution.<br>
 This method does not differentiate between the two forms of free chlorine: HOCl, and OCl<sup>-</sup>.<br>
 The amounts of HOCl and OCl<sup>-</sup> present in solution are pH dependent.<br>
If the process pH is allowed to rise too high, all free chlorine in solution will be present as OCl-, the less efficient sanitizer, yet the total free chlorine levels, as reported accurately by the DPD test, will remain the same.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2">5. The DPD test kit is in very common use.<br>
 DPD will distinguish free from combined chlorine.<br>
 A DPD residual will be fee available chlorine, not some combination of HOCL, monochloramine, dichloramine and trichloramine.<br>
 It will effectively protect the swimming pool from contamination.<br>
 The method is simple and rapid.<br>
 A DPD NO. 1 tablet is dissolved in a measured amount of swimming pool water to produce a coloured solution.<br>
This colour is compared with the colour standards in the comparator to find the amount of FAC that is present.<br>
 The amount of chloramine that is present can easily be determining by adding a DPD NO. 3 tablet to the same test sample and determining whether any additional colour develops.<br>
 The difference between this total chlorine measurement and the FAC test result equals the chloramine content of the water.<br>
 Example: DPD No. 3 minus DPD No. 1 Chloramines 1.5 ppm to 1.3 ppm 0.2 ppm chloramines.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">6. Total Free Chloramine residual<br>
 This test method indicates precisely when remedial action is necessary to prevent the accumulation of chloramines in swimming pool water.<br>
 Bleaching out occurs when at above 10 ppm free available chlorine in a swimming pool, a DPD test kit often indicates zero chlorine. because the reagent is being destroyed.<br>
 If you observe an initial pink colour that then rapidly fades, you probably have far too much residual chlorine in the water.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="18.7.22H"></a>18.7.22 Starting to use a filled swimming pool<br>
 1. Adjust the water level.<br>
 2. Check pump, filter, dosing equipment and gauges, and replace or repair if faulty.<br>
 3. Check for algae infestation on walls and floor.<br>
 4. Superchlorinate until free chlorine residual of 10 milligrams per litre is obtained.<br>
 This may be achieved by the addition of calcium hypochlorite or by running the sodium hypochlorite dosing pumps while the recirculation system is running.<br>
 5. Start up the pump and filter system.<br>
 6. Run for at least 48 hours before allowing swimmers into the swimming pool.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="18.7.23.0H"></a>18.7.23.0 Chloramines in swimming pools<br>
 Chloramine NH2Cl, dichloramine NHCl2, trichloramine, NCl3<br>
 Organic chloramines, RNHCl, are quite stable and useful sources of chlorine for bleaching, disinfection and oxidation when necessary to kill bacteria.<br>
 However, chloramines can be eliminated from swimming pool water only by using activated carbon filters.<br>
 In pure form it is an oily liquid that is highly reactive and explosive.<br>
 Some chemists who first discovered it or first used it were badly injured.<br>
 It may be formed in swimming pools when disinfecting.<br>
 If the pH of swimming pools is &lt; 6.8, urea forms chloramines.<br>
 Chloramines are mildly toxic to bacteria, but react with urea from swimmers' urine to irritate the eyes and mucous membranes.<br>
 Nitrogen trichloride, not chlorine gas, causes the "swimming pool smell".<br>
 Nitrogen trichloride gas is very volatile and will escape from solution in to the air to give a characteristic noxious chlorine smell.<br>
 It is toxic, it is also very corrosive and is responsible for stress corrosion cracking of the fabric of buildings and ventilation systems.<br>
 chloramines may cause asthma in competitive swimmers and swimming pool instructors.<br>
 The reactions of chlorine with ammonia and ammonia compounds formed from organic waste to form chloramines are often written as follows:<br>
 (1.) 4NH3 + 3Cl2 --> NCl3 + 3NH4Cl<br>
 ammonia + chlorine --> nitrogen trichloride (trichloramine) + ammonium chloride<br>
 In hot water ammonia forms<br>
 (2.) NCl3 + H2O --> NH3 + 3HOCl<br>
 nitrogen trichloride (trichloramine) + hot water --> ammonia + hypochlorous acid [chloric (I) acid]<br>
 There is no chemical that changes colour when someone urinates in a swimming pool.<br>
 There are dyes that could cloud, change colour, or produce a colour in response to urine, but these chemicals would also be activated by other compounds, producing embarrassing false positives.<br>
 Also, ammonia and ammonia compounds react with HOCl to form chloramines.<br>
 (3.) Formation of monochloramine<br>
 NH3 + HOCl --> NH2Cl + H2O<br>
 ammonia + hypochlorous acid &lt;--> chloramine + water<br>
 (4) Formation of dichloramine:<br>
 NH2Cl + HOCl --> NHCl2 + H2O<br>
 chloramine + hypochlorous acid &lt;--> dichloramine + water<br>
 Chloramine may react with each other,<br>
 (5) Reactions of monochloramine with dichloramine<br>
 NH2Cl + NH2Cl --> N2 (g) + 3HCl<br>
 dichloramine + dichloramine, nitrogen + hydrochloric acid<br>
 or, in the presence of excess HOCl, produce nitrogen trichloride<br>
 Total equation: 2NH3 + 3HOCl --> N2 (g) + 3HCI + 3H2O<br>
 (6) Further addition of chlorine forms nitrogen trichloride, the "smell of chlorine", that leaves "agitated" water and may cause eye irritation:<br>
 NH2Cl + HOCl --> NCl3 + H2O<br>
 dichloramine + hypochlorous acid, nitrogen trichloride + water.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="18.7.23.1H"></a>18.7.23.1 Sanitizer<br>
Ammonia NH3 quickly combines with chlorine to form bad smelling chloramines.<br>
 The chloramines are undesirable smelly compounds formed when insufficient levels of free available chlorine react with ammonia and other nitrogen containing compounds (swimmer waste, sweat, urine).<br>
 Chloramines are a threat to human health and are very poor sanitizers.<br>
 Chloramines can be destroyed by superchlorination.<br>
Since all chlorinated sanitizers react with water to produce HOCl, chlorine consumption depends on the amount of contamination that is present.<br>
 Enough sanitizer must be added to meet the chlorine demand of the water before a measurable residual can be maintained.<br>
 This amount depends on the amount of contamination present in make up water, plus whatever is added by swimmer loading, rain, dust and other external sources, e.g. nitrogenous wastes from swimmers' bodies.<br>
 Whether they are as simple as ammonia in urine, or as complex as the components in perspiration or saliva, they present special problems when they accumulate in swimming pool water.<br>
 These contaminants react with HOCl to form compounds called chloramines, or combined chlorine.<br>
 The combined chlorine reaction begins with one unit of ammonia, combining with one unit of HOCl to form monochloramine NH2Cl.<br>
 This reacts with another unit of HOCl to form dichloramine and finally with a third unit of HOCl to produce trichloramine NCl3.<br>
It takes a fourth unit of HOCl to finally convert the original molecule of ammonia into harmless nitrogen gas N2, water and chloride ion C l<sup>-</sup> and a fifth unit of HOCl before a free available chlorine residual can be measured.<br>
 These chloramines cause trouble in swimming pool water, because they are stable and persistent.<br>
 The monodichloramine and trichloramine from this first unit of ammonia will survive and accumulate with the chloramines formed from subsequent units of ammonia.<br>
 This is actually chlorine consumption, because HOCl combined with ammonia forms chloramines.<br>
 Chloramines have very poor sanitizing power, so algae and bacteria can grow.<br>
 In fact, they have such poor swimming pool sanitizing power that they would be rated at only 0 to 10 on a relative activity scale with HOCl rated at 10 000.<br>
 Chloramines could provide germ fee water if they were present at a concentration of at least 25 to 50 ppm.<br>
 However, this concentration would create additional problems in a swimming pool, because chloramines are very pungent and irritating, causing eye irritation and chlorine odours at very low concentrations.<br>
 Unfortunately, the chlorine odours generated by chloramines lead many people to think that too much chlorine has been added.<br>
 So, they stop adding chemicals and problems grow worse.<br>
 These symptoms are a signal to test and adjust pH, and add enough chlorine to oxidize all the chloramines, establishing a free available chlorine residual.<br>
 It is often very difficult to convince a swimming pool owner that insufficient chlorination is the cause of chlorine odours, eye burn and algae, because the owner probably tested the swimming pool when a problem was noticed, and got a very positive chlorine test according to the test kit.<br>
 This is the most confusing problem caused by combined chlorine.<br>
 Some test methods measure it as part of a total chlorine residual.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="18.7.23.2H"></a>18.7.23.2 Combined chlorine<br>
Recent studies have focussed attention on combined chlorine in swimming pools, a common name for mono-, di- and trichloramine.<br>
Chloramines and trihalomethanes, with chloroform, as the best known compound in this group, are generally characterized as disinfection by-products, because they emerge as secondary pollutants out of the reaction between chlorine disinfectants and organic pollutants in water.<br>
 Chloramines are formed in water by reaction between nitrogen hydrocarbons, more especially ammonia compounds like urea (NH2)2CO and chlorine following
 reactions (1) (5)<br>
 1. NH4<sup>+</sup> + H2O, H3O<sup>+</sup> + NH3 (decomposition of urea from urine, sweat)<br>
 2. NH3 + Cl2 --> NH2Cl monochloramine<br>
 3. NH2Cl + Cl2 --> NHCl2 dichloramine<br>
4. NHCl2 + Cl2 --> NCl3 trichloramine<br>
 5. NH2R + Cl2 --> NHRCl alkylmonochloramine<br>
 Trichloramine NCl3, formed in swimming pool water at pH &lt; 6, is very volatile and responsible for a pungent, acid smell, which is generally confused with a strong chlorine odour and, which is the main cause for eye irritation in covered swimming pools.<br>
 Chloramines can be prevented forming by using CO2 as a pH corrector to limit the low pH needed for trichloramine formation, or by using alternative disinfection products, bromine, ozone or chlorine dioxide (in pure form or as a complex compound, e.g. Hydroxan, all with a low chloramine forming potential.<br>
 Once formed, chloramines can be reduced with:<br>
 1. active charcoal in granular form in filters, in powder or as hydroanthracite in double layer filters<br>
 2. breakpoint chlorination, with chlorine at least ten times above the chloramine concentration in swimming pool water.<br>
 As chloramines can hardly be found in open air swimming pools, because of the almost immediate destruction by incident sunlight, the idea grew years ago to use artificial sunlight as a chloramine reduction tool.<br>
 The chloramine separator of P. Kaas used ultraviolet and infrared light and was used with changing success from the years 1975-80 on.<br>
 The use of UV light was promoted as best available technique in water treatment of swimming pools by the Flemish Technology Research Institute VITO.<br>
 Recently, new UV systems became available on the market using low or medium pressure UV lamps.<br>
 Low pressure lamps contain mercury vapour at about 10<sup>-3</sup> bar and emit monochromatic light of 254 nm while the medium pressure.<br>
 One type operates at mercury vapour pressures that emits polychromatic light, including the 254 nm wavelength.<br>
 This is near the optimum wavelength of 245 nm at which monochloramine, the precursor of dichloramine and trichloramine, breaks down by photochemical oxidation.<br>
 Thus low pressure lamps focus on the breakdown of monochloramine, while medium pressure lamps attack dichloramine and trichloramine.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="18.7.24H"></a>18.7.24 Total chlorine 
 Total chlorine is the sum of combined chlorine and free chlorine, i.e. the total amount of chlorine in the swimming pool water.<br>
 When chlorine is added to water in a newly filled swimming pool, some of it is consumed in the process of destroying algae, bacteria and other oxidizable material in the water.<br>
 The amount of chlorine consumed in this process is referred to as the chlorine demand of the water.<br>
 Once the chlorine demand is satisfied, any additional chlorine added is referred to as chlorine residual.<br>
 With a DPD test kit, DPD1 shows free available chlorine and DPD3 shows total chlorine.<br>
 The difference, if any, is the level of combined chlorine.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="18.7.25H"></a>18.7.25 Combined chlorine<br>
 Combined chlorine is the measure of chlorine that has attached itself to other molecules or organisms, usually ammonia or nitrogen compounds.<br>
 Most of these compounds are present as unwanted chloramines.<br>
 So combined chlorine is the chlorine that has combined with ammonium.<br>
 compounds or organic matter containing nitrogen to form chloramines.<br>
 Combined chlorine residual is the chlorine combined with simple nitrogen compounds such as ammonia and urea as chloramine that is non-effective as a sanitizer compared to free available chlorine.<br>
 Bactericidal properties of combined chlorine (i.e. chloramines) is only about one hundredth that of a similar level of free chlorine in water.<br>
With a DPD test kit, DPD1 shows free available chlorine and DPD3 shows total chlorine.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="18.7.31H"></a>18.7.31 Chlorine lock:<br>
Chlorine lock occurs if the level of cyanuric acid (stabilizer) in the swimming pool water is much over 80 ppm, the chlorine becomes trapped and is unable to oxidize effectively.<br>
 Despite being able to measure normal chlorine levels, the redox potential is very low, indicating a lack of oxidizer.<br>
 The only way to fix this is to drain some of the swimming pool water and refill the swimming pool.<br>
 Care should be taken when using stabilized chlorine products (dichlor or trichlor) to avoid the level of cyanuric acid increasing too much.<br>

 The organic waste may form undesirable chloramines, which require large amounts of chlorine or non-chlorine shock to be destroyed.<br>
 There is a famous myth that a special substance may be added to swimming pool water to reveal the presence of urine and embarrass the urinating swimmer.<br>
 No such substance exists.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="18.7.58H"></a>18.7.58 Sodium bicarbonate<br>
 A base used to raise total alkalinity in swimming pool water with only a slight effect on the pH.<br>
 Sodium bicarbonate can only raise the pH of the swimming pool water to 8.5, regardless of the amount used.<br>
 Do not add large quantities at one time.<br>
 A correspondent from New Zealand reports that he got great results, sparking water, excellent control and minimal chemical use by raising the total alkalinity to 200 ppm + using sodium bicarbonate and in the process got a stable pH of 8.3, which he almost never had to test for.<br>
 Also, the chemical was safe to use.<br>
The correspondent compensated for the higher pH by running the swimming pools with a FAC of around 4 ppm and not letting it drop below 1 ppm.<br>
 He only used sodium hypochlorite diluted to 8% to give a good shelf life.<br>
 This procedure was satisfactory for about 20 swimming pools.<br>
 In this procedure the ORP is above 650 mV at pH 8.4 and 4 ppm free chlorine, but less than 750 mV.<br>
 650 mV to 750 mV is the recommended range for effective sanitation.<br>
 Assuming he did not use stabilizer or did not need to, he probably needed to top up the bicarbonate relatively frequently to keep it at around 200.<br>
 A lower alkalinity and a weekly dose of acid, to give lower pH and higher ORP could allow free chlorine to be reduced to about 1 ppm.<br>
 To maintain a stable pH level, add about 100 mg / kg of sodium bicarbonate to water, i.e. about 6 kg in a 60, 000 litre pool.<br>
 Or<br>
Add 1.5 pounds of baking soda for each 10, 000 gallons of water to raise total alkalinity by 10 ppm, for total alkalinity within 80 to 150 ppm.<br>
 Maintain a proper level of total alkalinity to minimize changes in pH when acidic or basic chemicals or contaminants enter the water, reducing chloramine formation, corrosivity of water, eye irritation and unpleasant odours, while improving bactericidal effectiveness.<br>
