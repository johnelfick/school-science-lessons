<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="14.1.0H">14.1.0</a> Exothermic and endothermic reactions<br>
The reaction is exothermic if the energy absorbed in bond breaking &lt; energy released when bonds form.<br>
In an exothermic reaction, water containing the reacting ions become hotter, because of the heat energy released by the ions.<br>
The reaction is endothermic if the energy absorbed in bond breaking &gt; energy released when bonds form.<br>
In an endothermic reaction, water containing the ions becomes colder, because the ions absorb heat energy.<br>
Energy is measured in joules (J) or kilojoules (kJ).<br>
In an endothermic reaction, the energy absorbed when chemical bonds break is greater than the energy released when chemical bonds form.<br>
C + y kJ --> D, i.e. C -->D<br>
DH = +y kJ / mol C.<br>

 <b>Be careful!</b> The reactions may be vigorous.<br>
The reactants of exothermic reactions form products with rise in temperature.<br>
 If less energy is needed to break the bonds in a reaction than the energy released by making the bonds, the reaction is endothermic.<br>
 1. Put 1 cm of white anhydrous copper (II) sulfate powder in a test-tube.<br>
 Hold a thermometer with the bulb in the powder.<br>
 Add water drop by drop.<br>
 Record any change in the thermometer reading.<br>
 (Water with anhydrous compounds reactions.)<br>
 CuSO4 + 5H2O --> CuSO4.5H2O<br>
2. Put 10 mL of 0.4 M copper (II) sulfate solution into a wide test-tube.<br>
Support a thermometer with the bulb in the solution.<br>
Add magnesium powder, or magnesium ribbon, a little at a time, until the blue colour disappears.<br>
Record any change in the thermometer reading.<br>
Magnesium is higher in the reactivity series than copper so it displaces copper from its sulfate.<br>
3. To a little water in a wide test-tube, add concentrated sulfuric acid, drop by drop, down the side of the test-tube.<br>
Stir gently with a thermometer after the addition of each drop.<br>
Record any change in the thermometer reading.<br>
(Concentrated acid with water reactions)<br>
4. Citric acid with sodium hydrogen carbonate solution<br>
5. Thermite reaction<br>

6. Dilute hydrochloric acid with dilute sodium hydroxide solution.<br>
 (Neutralization reactions)<br>
7. Burning substances and combustion of fuels.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="14.1.2H">14.1.2</a> Endothermic reactions<br>
<a href="../images/3.81ch.gif">See diagram 3.81: </a> Temperature of potassium nitrate solution.<br>
 An endothermic reaction drops in temperature as it absorbs heat energy.<br>
 If more energy is needed to break the bonds in a reaction than the energy released by making the bonds, the reaction is endothermic.<br>
 Endothermic dissolving processes of a solid in a solvent are associated with low solubility.<br>
 1. Put 10 mL of water in a test-tube.<br>
 Read the temperature of the water.<br>
Dissolve 2 g of potassium nitrate in the water.<br>
 The temperature should fall through 90 oC.<br>
 So while dissolving, the particles are absorbing heat energy.<br>
 This energy is taken from the surrounding water.<br>
 Repeat the experiment with potassium chloride.<br>
 Mg + CuSO4 --> MgSO4 + Cu displacement<br>
 2. Add citric acid to sodium hydrogen carbonate solution in styrofoam cup.<br>
 Stir the solution and note the temperature change.<br>
 When the reaction stops the temperature should return to room temperature.<br>
 H3C6H5O7 (aq) + 3NaHCO3 (s) --> 3CO2 (g) + 3H2O (l) + Na3C6H5O7 (aq)<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="14.1.3H">14.1.3</a> Energy of reactions<br>
1. Energy of reactions, Heat of reaction (enthalpy), Thermal capacity, Hess's law<br>
* Pairs of atoms may be bound together by the sharing of electrons between them in a covalent bond.<br>
 Two or more atoms bound together by one or more covalent bonds form a molecule, with definite size, shape and arrangement of bonds.<br>
 An atom or group of atoms covalently bound together may gain or lose one or more electrons to form ions.<br>
* Forces weaker than covalent bonding exist between molecules.<br>
 The structure of a metal involves positive ions embedded in a sea of electrons.<br>
* All chemicals contain two kinds of energy, kinetic energy of the particles and the energy stored in their chemical bonds.<br>
 Energy is absorbed when chemical bonds are broken and energy is released when chemical bonds form.<br>
In a chemical reaction, some bonds are broken in the reactants and some bonds form in the products.<br>
2. Heat of reaction<br>
Heat of reaction (enthalpy of reaction) DH, can be expressed as heat of combustion, heat of crystallization, heat of formation, heat of neutralization, heat of solution.<br>
DH is the heat change for a reaction in kJ per mol of reactant or product.<br>
If DH is negative the reaction is exothermic.<br>
If DH is positive the reaction is endothermic.<br>
Enthalpy of reaction, heat of reaction<br>
Enthalpy, heat content, refers to the energy stored in a substance.<br>
Enthalpy, H = U + PV, where U = internal energy, P = pressure and V = volume, of a system.<br>
The SI unit is the joule.<br>
Energy from chemical reactions<br>
The heat of reaction, DH (δH) is the heat change for a reaction in kJ per mol of reactant or product.<br>
Heat of reaction is also called the enthalpy of reaction.<br>
For endothermic reactions, DH (δH) is positive.<br>
For exothermic reactions, DH (δH) is negative.<br>
 A --> B + xkJ.<br>
 i.e. A --> B, DH is -xkJ / mol A.<br>
<b>Be careful! The reactions may be vigorous!</b>.<br>
3. Thermal capacity<br>
Thermal capacity (heat capacity) is the ratio of how much heat is supplied to the resulting rise in temperature.<br>
Specific heat capacity refers to the mass of the substance and is measured in J K-1 kg-1.<br>
 Molar heat capacity refers to amount of substance and is measured in J K-1 mol-1 (K = kelvin, oK = - 273.15 Co).<br>
4. Hess's law, (law of additivity, law of constant heat summation)<br>
Hess's law states that the overall energy change from reactants to products is the same by direct reaction or any other route.<br>
If equations can be added to give a final equation, the heats of reaction of each equation can be added to give the heat of reaction of the final equation.<br>
This law is an example of the principle of conservation of energy.<br>
 For example:<br>
 Reaction 1 H2SO4 (10 M) + NaOH (1 M) --> NaHSO4 (0.5 M) + H2O, dH1<br>
 Reaction 2 H2SO4 (10 M) + solvent --> H2SO4 (1 M) dH2<br>
 Reaction 3 H2SO4 (1M) + NaOH (1 M) --> NaHSO4 (0.5 M) + H2O, dH3,<br>
 dH1 = dH2 + dH3.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="14.3.1H">14.3.1</a> Heat of displacement reaction<br>
<a href="../images/3.2.83ch.gif">See diagram 3.2.83</a>: Heat from a displacement reaction<br>
 1. Use 02 M copper (II) sulfate solution and zinc or iron.<br>
 Use a plastic container, insulated with a polystyrene jacket for insulation, with a one-hole stopper fitted with a thermometer.<br>
 Put 25 mL of 02 M copper (II) sulfate in the container.<br>
 Replace the stopper invert and shake gently.<br>
 Record the initial temperature of this solution.<br>
 Add 05 g of zinc dust.<br>
 The amount is more than needed to ensure that all the copper (II) sulfate is used up in the reaction.<br>
 Replace the stopper, invert the bottle and shake gently.<br>
 Record the highest temperature reached.<br>
 The temperature difference should be about 10 oC.<br>
 Zn (s) + Cu2+ (aq) --> Zn2+ (aq) + Cu (s).<br>
2. Put 25 mL 0.2 M copper (II) sulfate solution in a 100 mL plastic bottle fitted with a one-hole stopper and thermometer.<br>
 Replace the stopper, invert the bottle and shake it gently.<br>
 Record the temperature of this solution.<br>
 Turn the bottle the right way up, remove the stopper and add 0.5 g of zinc dust.<br>
 The quantity of zinc powder is in excess to ensure that all the copper (II) sulfate is used up in the reaction, so some zinc will remain.<br>
 Replace the stopper, invert the bottle, and shake gently.<br>
 Record the highest temperature reached.<br>
 Calculate the rise of temperature.<br>
This rise of temperature in not affected by the volume of 0.2 M copper (II) sulfate used for the experiment.<br>
For a 1 M solution, multiply the rise in temperature by 5 (5 × 0.2M = 1.0 M).<br>
 The reactants lost energy to the solution.<br>
 The temperature change is usually between 9 oC and 10 oC.<br>
 Zn (s) + Cu2+ (aq) --> Zn2+ (aq) + Cu (s).<br>
3. Repeat the experiment with 0.5 g of iron powder or iron filings.<br>
 This amount is again in excess so that all the copper (II) sulfate will be used up in the reaction.<br>
 The temperature change is usually between 6 oC and 7 oC.<br>
 The zinc metal became zinc ions and copper ions became copper metal due to transfer of electrons from zinc metal to the copper ion.<br>
To get electrical energy, these electrons must flow in an external conductor, e.g. a wire, from the zinc to the copper.<br>
 The potential or voltage will reflect the greater activity of zinc over copper.<br>
 The current flowing will depend on the extent and rate of the reaction.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="14.3.2H">14.3.2</a> Heat of neutralization with a calorimeter<br>
<a href="../images/3.1.5ch.gif">See diagram 3.1.5</a>: Heat of neutralization<br>
 Neutralization heat is the formation heat of one mole of water molecules from H+ and OH- ions.<br>
 The measured value of neutralization heat is thus Q / 005.<br>
 If no insulated cup is available in the laboratory, the following simple apparatus can be used instead.<br>
 The heat of neutralization reaction of strong acids with bases is -58 kJ / mol.<br>
 The heat of neutralization = the heat of formation of one mole of water molecules from the ions.<br>
 Since the reacting particles release energy by giving this to the solution, the energy change can be written:<br>
 H (change of heat) = x -kJ / mol, the heat released when one mole of hydrogen ions (H+) reacts with one mole of hydroxide ions (OH-).<br>
 Both 1 mol / L hydrochloric acid and 1 mol / L sodium hydroxide have a density of 1 g / mL.<br>
The mass of 50 mL of 1 mol / L HCl =o 005 kg, i.e. m1 = 005 kg, so is the mass of 50 mL of 1 mol /L NaCl solution, i.e. m2 = 005 kg.<br>
 Consequently, the heat released by this neutralization reaction can be calculated as follows:<br>
 Quantity of heat = mass × specific heat × change in temperature.<br>
 Q = (005 + 005) × 42 × (t1 - t2).<br>
 H+ (aq) + OH- (aq) ---> H2O (l).<br>
Experiments<br>
 1. Make a simple calorimeter by using a plastic cup inside an insulated box.<br>
 Pour 50 mL of 2 M hydrochloric acid into the plastic cup and record the initial temperature.<br>
 Pour 50 mL of 2 M sodium hydroxide solution into a beaker and note the original temperature.<br>
When the initial temperatures are the same, add sodium hydroxide solution to the plastic cup while stirring constantly with the thermometer.<br>
 Record the highest temperature.<br>
 Assume that the specific heat capacity of this weak solution is the same as water = 42 kJ / kg /oC.<br>
 Also, assume that all the heat from the reaction heats the water, raising the temperature from t1 to t2.<br>
 Calculate how much heat that would be produced if 1 M of sodium hydroxide is neutralized by 1 M of hydrochloric acid.<br>
2. Dissolve 40 g of sodium hydroxide pellets in water and make up to 500 mL, a 2M solution.<br>
Prepare 500 mL of a 2M hydrochloric acid solution and leave to cool.<br>
Note the temperature of the solutions when cool.<br>
Quickly add the acid to the base and stir with a thermometer.<br>
Note the maximum temperature reached.<br>
The increase of temperature should be 13 oC.<br>
You have doubled the volume of water by adding one solution to the other.<br>
So the final solution contains 1 mole of OH- (aq) ions that reacted with 1 mole of H+ (aq) ions to form 1 mole of water molecules.<br>
Assume that the specific heat of this weak solution is the same as the specific heat of water.<br>
3. Place some strips of paper in the bottom of a large beaker, and then stand a small beaker on the paper strips.<br>
Stuff the space between the two beakers with a lot more strips of paper.<br>
Cover the mouth of the large beaker using a piece of cardboard to reduce heat loss.<br>
Repeat the experiment with 1 mol / L ethanoic acid (acetic acid) replacing hydrochloric acid.<br>
The determined value of neutralization heat will be lower, because ethanoic acid is a weak acid, mainly in molecular form in aqueous solution.<br>
So some energy released by the neutralization must be used to ionize the ethanoic acid molecules.<br>
 4. Repeat the experiment with equal concentrations of other strong acids and bases.<br>
 The heat of neutralization, J, is the same, because the same chemical reaction above occurs.<br>
 Na+ + OH- + H+ + Cl- --> Na+ + Cl- + H2O + J joules<br>
 OH- + H+ --> H2O + J joules.<br>
5. Repeat the experiment using 2 M ethanoic acid, acetic acid, HAc.<br>
The heat of neutralization, J1, is lower.<br>
Ethanoic acid is a weak acid mainly in molecular form.<br>
Some energy from the heat of neutralization is used to ionize the ethanoic acid molecules.<br>
HAc + J1 --> H+ + Ac-<br>
So the heat evolved = J - J1<br>
CH3COOH (aq) + NaOH (aq) --> CH3COONa (aq) +H2O (l).<br>

 1. Prepare a supersaturated solution of sodium ethanoate-3-water to make a "heat pack".<br>
 Dissolve 125 g sodium ethanoate-3-water, CH3CO2Na.3H2O, in 12.5 mL water.<br>
 Heat to form a clear solution, cover with a watch glass and leave to cool.<br>
 Hold a watch glass in the palm of your hand, pour in some solution then add a few crystals of sodium ethanoate-3-water.<br>
 The supersaturated solution immediately crystallizes.<br>
 Feel the heat given out.<br>
 The exothermic property of the crystallization of saturated solutions is used in "heat packs" sold by chemical suppliers.<br>
2. Heat packs provide instant, portable and reusable heat and generate heat for two to three hours.<br>
To reactivate after use, boil the heat pack in water until it is clear and then remove and let cool.<br>
Heat packs may contain sodium acetate, which will freeze at 54C in an open container.<br>
However, when this solution is in a sealed container, the solution can be cooled below this temperature, as low as -10 oC.<br>
Flexing a metal "trigger" within the sealed container causes a few molecules of liquid to crystallize.<br>
This crystallization starts a chain reaction causing the supercooled solution to change from a liquid to a solid as crystals form.<br>
This phase change causes the pack to give out heat.<br>
When the heat pack contents crystallize, its temperature returns to its freezing point.<br>
This supercooled solution can be stored for extended periods and still crystallizes on demand,<br>
Once the unit has given off all of its heat, it is then recycled by heating it in boiling water.<br>
The crystals dissolve in their own water of crystallization.<br>
The heat pack returns back to a liquid state and then cools below its freezing temperature.<br>
It is then ready to be activated again.<br>

Experiments
1. Mix half a metal bottle top of powdered sulfur with the same volume of iron filings.<br>
Heat a small portion of the mixture on the metal bottle top with the cork removed or in a hard glass test-tube.<br>
When the reaction begins, i.e. the mixture starts to glow, stop heating by moving the Bunsen burner to the side.<br>
If the glow stops, heat the test-tube again.<br>
The reaction of a mixture of iron with sulfur gives out so much heat that the mixture becomes red hot.<br>
Note the following different properties of powdered sulfur, iron filings and the iron (II) sulfide: | appearance | colour | hardness | magnetism|.<br>
Iron is magnetic so is easily removed from a mixture of iron and sulfur, but iron (II) sulfide is not magnetic.<br>

K3Fe(CN)6 (aq) + Fe2+ (aq) --> KFe[Fe(CN)6] (s) + 2 K+ (aq)<br>
10. In blueprinting, the undeveloped paper is covered with iron (III) ferricyanide ion, and citrate.<br>
In the light, the citrate reduces the iron (III) to iron (II).<br>
With the addition of water, the deep blue pigment forms.<br>

 1. Put 2 cm of iron (III) chloride solution in a test-tube.<br>
 Pass hydrogen sulfide through the solution until there is no further precipitate of sulfur occurs.<br>
 Filter the solution and note the pale green solution.<br>
 Test the filtrate with potassium ferricyanide for proof of iron (II) salt.<br>
 2FeCl3 + H2S --> 2FeCl2 + 2HCl + S (s)<br>
 Iron (III) ions are reduced to iron (II) ions by electron gain.<br>
 Fe3+ + e- --> Fe2+<br>
Sulfide ions are oxidized by electron loss.<br>
 H2S &lt;--> 2H + + S2-<br>
 S2- - 2e- --> S.<br>
2. Add an equal volume of concentrated hydrochloric acid and pieces of granulated zinc to 3 cm of iron (III) salt solution.<br>
 Leave for half an hour then filter.<br>
 Test the filtrate with excess of sodium hydroxide solution to show that reduction to iron (II) is complete.<br>
 In the presence of acid, zinc atoms ionize and the electrons are accepted by iron (III) ions that are reduced to iron (II) ions.<br>
 Zn --> Zn3+ + 2e-<br>
 2Fe3+ + 2e- --> 2Fe2+.<br>
