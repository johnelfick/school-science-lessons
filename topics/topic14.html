<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="14.1.0H">14.1.0</a> Exothermic reactions<br>
The reactants of exothermic reactions form products with rise in temperature.<br>
Exothermic reactions give out heat energy<br>
In an exothermic reaction, the amount of energy absorbed when chemical bonds brake is less than the amount of energy released when chemical bondsform.<br>
The reaction is exothermic if the energy absorbed in bond breaking &lt; energy released when bonds form.<br>
In an exothermic reaction, water containing the reacting ions become hotter, because of the heat energy released by the ions.<br>
Example of exothermic reactions include; Combustion of gases, mixing strong acids and bases, adding water to strong acids and any anhydrous salt. dissolving laundry detergent in water, respiration, freezing water, burning candles, mixing cement and water.<br>
Uncontrolled exothermic reactions cause damaging fires and explosions.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="14.2.0H">14.2.0</a> Endothermic reactions<br>
 If less energy is needed to break the bonds in a reaction than the energy released by making the bonds, the reaction is endothermic.<br>
The reaction is endothermic if the energy absorbed in bond breaking &gt; energy released when bonds form.<br>
In an endothermic reaction, water containing the ions becomes colder, because the ions absorb heat energy.<br>
Energy is measured in joules (J) or kilojoules (kJ).<br>
In an endothermic reaction, the energy absorbed when chemical bonds break is greater than the energy released when chemical bonds form<br>
C + y kJ --> D, i.e. C -->D<br>
DH = +y kJ / mol C.<br>
In an endothermic reaction, the amount of energy absorbed when chemical bonds are broken is greater than the amount of energy released when chemical bonds are formed.
Endothermic reactions take in heat energy<br>
<a href="../images/3.81ch.gif">See diagram 3.81: </a> Temperature of potassium nitrate solution.<br>
 An endothermic reaction drops in temperature as it absorbs heat energy.<br>
 If more energy is needed to break the bonds in a reaction than the energy released by making the bonds, the reaction is endothermic.<br>
 If less energy is needed to break the bonds in a reaction than the energy released by making the bonds, the reaction is endothermic.<br>
 Endothermic dissolving processes of a solid in a solvent are associated with low solubility.<br>
  Mg + CuSO4 --> MgSO4 + Cu displacement<br>
 2. Add citric acid to sodium hydrogen carbonate solution in styrofoam cup.<br>
 Stir the solution and note the temperature change.<br>
 When the reaction stops the temperature should return to room temperature.<br>
 H3C6H5O7 (aq) + 3NaHCO3 (s) --> 3CO2 (g) + 3H2O (l) + Na3C6H5O7 (aq)<br>
 3. Dissolve ammonium chloride in water.<br>
 4. Dissolve ammonium nitrate in water.<br>
 5. Dissolve potassium chloride in water.<br>
 6. Pass dry ammonium chloride over barium hydroxide octahydrate crystals.<br>
 7. Add sodium carbonate to ethanoic acid.<br>
 8. Add thionyl chloride (SOCl2) to cobalt (II) sulfate heptahydrate.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="14.3H">14.3</a> Heat of reaction, Hess's law<br>
Heat of reaction (enthalpy of reaction) DH, can be expressed as heat of combustion, heat of crystallization, heat of formation, heat of neutralization, heat of solution.<br>
 DH is the heat change for a reaction in kJ per mol of reactant or product.<br>
 If DH is negative the reaction is exothermic.<br>
 If DH is positive the reaction is endothermic.<br>
Hess's law, law of additivity, law of constant heat summation, states that the overall energy change from reactants to products is the same by direct reaction or any other route.<br>
So if equations can be added to give a final equation the heats of reaction of each equation can be added to give the heat of reaction of the final equation.<br>
This law is an example of the principle of conservation of energy.<br>
 For example:<br>
 Reaction 1 H2SO4 (10 M) + NaOH (1 M) --> NaHSO4 (0.5 M) + H2O, dH1<br>
 Reaction 2 H2SO4 (10 M) + solvent --> H2SO4 (1 M) dH2<br>
 Reaction 3 H2SO4 (1M) + NaOH (1 M) --> NaHSO4 (0.5 M) + H2O, dH3,<br>
 dH1 = dH2 + dH3.<br>
Thermal capacity<br>
 Thermal capacity (heat capacity) is the ratio of how much heat is supplied to the resulting rise in temperature.<br>
 Specific heat capacity refers to the mass of the substance and is measured in J K-1 kg-1.<br>
 Molar heat capacity refers to amount of substance and is measured in J K-1 mol-1 (K = kelvin, oK = - 273.15 Co).<br>
Energy of reactions<br>
1. Pairs of atoms may be bound together by the sharing of electrons between them in a covalent bond.<br>
 Two or more atoms bound together by one or more covalent bonds form a molecule, with definite size, shape and arrangement of bonds.<br>
 An atom or group of atoms covalently bound together may gain or lose one or more electrons to form ions.<br>
2. Forces weaker than covalent bonding exist between molecules.<br>
 The structure of a metal involves positive ions embedded in a sea of electrons.<br>
3. All chemicals contain two kinds of energy, kinetic energy of the particles and the energy stored in their chemical bonds.<br>
 Energy is absorbed when chemical bonds are broken and energy is released when chemical bonds form.<br>
In a chemical reaction, some bonds are broken in the reactants and some bonds form in the products.<br>
<b>"Be Careful! When diluting strong acids always slowly add ACID to WATER.<br>
 Never add water to acid.</b><br>
 1. Add concentrated sulfuric acid very slowly to water.<br>
 Stir the mixture thoroughly each time a small amount of acid is added.<br>
 Note any change in temperature.<br>
100 mL H2SO4 + 100 mL H2O (20o C) → H3O++ HSO4– (130o C, after about one minute!)<br>
2. Pass hydrogen chloride gas into water.<br>
 Note any change in temperature.<br>
3. Add acetic acid to water.<br>
 Acetic acid, a weak acid, produces less heat than the strong acids sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid.<br>
4. To a little water in a wide test-tube, add concentrated sulfuric acid, drop by drop, down the side of the test-tube.<br>
 Stir gently with a thermometer after the addition of each drop.<br>
 Note any changes in the thermometer reading.<br>
5. Pour 2 cm of water into a test-tube.<br>
 Add concentrated sulfuric acid drop by drop down the side of the tube.<br>
 BE CAREFUL!<br>
 Stir gently with a thermometer after the addition of each drop.<br>
 Record the changes in temperature of the solution.<br>
6. Pour dilute sodium hydroxide solution into the test-tube.<br>
 Test with litmus paper.<br>
 Red litmus paper turns blue.<br>
 Add dilute hydrochloric acid until the litmus paper turns to a colour between blue and red.<br>
 Record the changes in temperature of the solution.<br>
Energy from chemical reactions<br>
 The heat of reaction, DH (δH) is the heat change for a reaction in kJ per mol of reactant or product.<br>
 This is also called the enthalpy of reaction.<br>
 For endothermic reactions, DH (δH) is positive.<br>
 For exothermic reactions, DH (δH) is negative.<br>
 A --> B + xkJ<br>
 i.e. A --> B, DH is -xkJ / mol A<br>
<b>Be careful! The reactions may be vigorous!</b>.<br>
Experiments<br>
 1. Use a test-tube containing a thermometer.<br>
 Record the initial temperature.<br>
 Put anhydrous copper (II) sulfate powder in the test-tube.<br>
 Add water drop by drop.<br>
 Record the changes in temperature of the solution.<br>
 2. Put white anhydrous copper (II) sulfate powder to a depth of 1 cm in a test-tube.<br>
 Hold a thermometer with the bulb in the powder.<br>
 Add water drop by drop.<br>
 Record the changes of the thermometer reading.<br>
CuSO4 (s) (white) + 5H20 (l) --> CuSO4.5H2O (s) (blue)<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="14.4H">14.4</a> Heat of rusting<br>
 1. Moisten some steel wool with iron chloride solution to accelerate rusting.<br>
 Wrap the bulb of a thermometer in the steel wool.<br>
 Hang in a draught free place.<br>
 Note the temperature changes as rust forms.<br>
2. Roll some steel wool into a ball and weigh it.<br>
 Use tongs to hold the ball of steel wool over a sheet of paper.<br>
 Heat the steel wool over a burner until red-hot.<br>
 Remove the burner and blow gently on the red hot steel wool until it stops burning.<br>
 Weigh the burned steel wool and any fragments that have fallen on to the sheet of paper.<br>
 The weight is greater, because the iron oxide that forms is heavier than the steel wool.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="14.5H">14.5</a> Heat of neutralization with a calorimeter<br>
<a href="../images/3.5ch.gif">See diagram 3.5</a>: Heat of neutralization<br>
 Neutralization heat is the formation heat of one mole of water molecules from H+ and OH- ions.<br>
 The measured value of neutralization heat is thus Q / 005.<br>
 If no insulated cup is available in the laboratory, the following simple apparatus can be used instead.<br>
 The heat of neutralization reaction of strong acids with bases is -58 kJ / mol.<br>
 The heat of neutralization = the heat of formation of one mole of water molecules from the ions.<br>
 Since the reacting particles release energy by giving this to the solution, the energy change can be written:<br>
 H (change of heat) = x -kJ / mol, the heat released when one mole of hydrogen ions (H+) reacts with one mole of hydroxide ions (OH-).<br>
 Both 1 mol / L hydrochloric acid and 1 mol / L sodium hydroxide have a density of 1 g / mL.<br>
The mass of 50 mL of 1 mol / L HCl =o 005 kg, i.e. m1 = 005 kg, so is the mass of 50 mL of 1 mol /L NaCl solution, i.e. m2 = 005 kg.<br>
 Consequently, the heat released by this neutralization reaction can be calculated as follows:<br>
 Quantity of heat = mass × specific heat × change in temperature.<br>
 Q = (005 + 005) × 42 × (t1 - t2).<br>
 H+ (aq) + OH- (aq) ---> H2O (l).<br>
Experiments<br>
 1. Make a simple calorimeter by using a plastic cup inside an insulated box.<br>
 Pour 50 mL of 2 M hydrochloric acid into the plastic cup and record the initial temperature.<br>
 Pour 50 mL of 2 M sodium hydroxide solution into a beaker and note the original temperature.<br>
When the initial temperatures are the same, add sodium hydroxide solution to the plastic cup while stirring constantly with the thermometer.<br>
 Record the highest temperature.<br>
 Assume that the specific heat capacity of this weak solution is the same as water = 42 kJ / kg / oC.<br>
 Also, assume that all the heat from the reaction heats the water, raising the temperature from t1 to t2.<br>
 Calculate how much heat that would be produced if 1 M of sodium hydroxide is neutralized by 1 M of hydrochloric acid.<br>
2. Dissolve 40 g of sodium hydroxide pellets in water and make up to 500 mL, a 2M solution.<br>
Prepare 500 mL of a 2M hydrochloric acid solution and leave to cool.<br>
Note the temperature of the solutions when cool.<br>
Quickly add the acid to the base and stir with a thermometer.<br>
Note the maximum temperature reached.<br>
The increase of temperature should be 13 oC.<br>
You have doubled the volume of water by adding one solution to the other.<br>
So the final solution contains 1 mole of OH- (aq) ions that reacted with 1 mole of H+ (aq) ions to form 1 mole of water molecules.<br>
Assume that the specific heat of this weak solution is the same as the specific heat of water.<br>
3. Place some strips of paper in the bottom of a large beaker, and then stand a small beaker on the paper strips.<br>
 Stuff the space between the two beakers with a lot more strips of paper.<br>
 Cover the mouth of the large beaker using a piece of cardboard to reduce heat loss.<br>
 Repeat the experiment with 1 mol / L ethanoic acid (acetic acid) replacing hydrochloric acid.<br>
 The determined value of neutralization heat will be lower, because ethanoic acid is a weak acid, mainly in molecular form in aqueous solution.<br>
 So some energy released by the neutralization must be used to ionize the ethanoic acid molecules.<br>
 4. Repeat the experiment with equal concentrations of other strong acids and bases.<br>
 The heat of neutralization, J, is the same, because the same chemical reaction above occurs.<br>
 Na+ + OH- + H+ + Cl- --> Na+ + Cl- + H2O + J joules<br>
 OH- + H+ --> H2O + J joules.<br>
<a name="14.6H">
5. Repeat the experiment using 2 M ethanoic acid, acetic acid, HAc.<br>
 The heat of neutralization, J1, is lower.<br>
 Ethanoic acid is a weak acid mainly in molecular form.<br>
 Some energy from the heat of neutralization is used to ionize the ethanoic acid molecules.<br>
 HAc + J1 --> H+ + Ac-<br>
 So the heat evolved = J - J1<br>
 CH3COOH (aq) + NaOH (aq) --> CH3COONa (aq) +H2O (l).<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">14.6 Heat of displacement reaction<br>
<a href="../images/3.2.83ch.gif">See diagram 3.2.83</a>: Heat from a displacement reaction<br>
 1. Use 02 M copper (II) sulfate solution and zinc or iron.<br>
 Use a plastic container, insulated with a polystyrene jacket for insulation, with a one-hole stopper fitted with a thermometer.<br>
 Put 25 mL of 02 M copper (II) sulfate in the container.<br>
 Replace the stopper invert and shake gently.<br>
 Record the initial temperature of this solution.<br>
 Add 05 g of zinc dust.<br>
 The amount is more than needed to ensure that all the copper (II) sulfate is used up in the reaction.<br>
 Replace the stopper, invert the bottle and shake gently.<br>
 Record the highest temperature reached.<br>
 The temperature difference should be about 10 oC.<br>
 Zn (s) + Cu2+ (aq) --> Zn2+ (aq) + Cu (s).<br>
2. Put 25 mL 0.2 M copper (II) sulfate solution in a 100 mL plastic bottle fitted with a one-hole stopper and thermometer.<br>
 Replace the stopper, invert the bottle and shake it gently.<br>
 Record the temperature of this solution.<br>
 Turn the bottle the right way up, remove the stopper and add 0.5 g of zinc dust.<br>
 The quantity of zinc powder is in excess to ensure that all the copper (II) sulfate is used up in the reaction, so some zinc will remain.<br>
 Replace the stopper, invert the bottle, and shake gently.<br>
 Record the highest temperature reached.<br>
 Calculate the rise of temperature.<br>
This rise of temperature in not affected by the volume of 0.2 M copper (II) sulfate used for the experiment.<br>
For a 1 M solution, multiply the rise in temperature by 5 (5 × 0.2M = 1.0 M).<br>
 The reactants lost energy to the solution.<br>
 The temperature change is usually between 9 oC and 10 oC.<br>
 Zn (s) + Cu2+ (aq) --> Zn2+ (aq) + Cu (s).<br>
<a name="14.7H">
3. Repeat the experiment with 0.5 g of iron powder or iron filings.<br>
 This amount is again in excess so that all the copper (II) sulfate will be used up in the reaction.<br>
 The temperature change is usually between 6 oC and 7 oC.<br>
 The zinc metal became zinc ions and copper ions became copper metal due to transfer of electrons from zinc metal to the copper ion.<br>
To get electrical energy, these electrons must flow in an external conductor, e.g. a wire, from the zinc to the copper.<br>
 The potential or voltage will reflect the greater activity of zinc over copper.<br>
 The current flowing will depend on the extent and rate of the reaction.<br>
<a name="14.8H">
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">14.7 Heat of reaction, potassium permanganate with glycerol<br>
<b>BE CAREFUL!</b> This is a dangerous experiment.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2">14.10 Heat of reaction, potassium with diethyl ether<br>
 This experiment is too dangerous for schools.<br>
<b>BE CAREFUL! THIS IS A DANGEROUS EXPERIMENT!</b><br>
 Use very small quantities and follow your safety rules.<br>
 Remember that strong oxidants should be stored separately from flammable organic chemicals.<br>
 Diethyl ether has an ignition temperature about 80 oC. A mixture of diethyl ether vapour and air is explosive!<br>
Experiment<br>
 Put a very small piece of potassium metal and a few drops of diethyl ether in a beaker covered with a watch glass.<br>
 Pour water into the large beaker.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2">14.11</a> Heat of reaction, crystallization of sodium acetate, sodium acetate heat pack<br>
Reusable hand warmers have a supersaturated sodium acetate solution inside the packet.<br>
 As the solution crystalizes, it releases energy as heat.<br> 
To reuse these hand warmers, boil the closed packet in water to return the crystals to a liquid.<br>
 1. Prepare a supersaturated solution of sodium ethanoate-3-water to make a "heat pack".<br>
 Dissolve 125 g sodium ethanoate-3-water, CH3CO2Na.3H2O, in 12.5 mL water.<br>
 Heat to form a clear solution, cover with a watch glass and leave to cool.<br>
 Hold a watch glass in the palm of your hand, pour in some solution then add a few crystals of sodium ethanoate-3-water.<br>
 The supersaturated solution immediately crystallizes.<br>
 Feel the heat given out.<br>
 The exothermic property of the crystallization of saturated solutions is used in "heat packs" sold by chemical suppliers.<br>
<a name="14.12H">
2. Heat packs provide instant, portable and reusable heat and generate heat for two to three hours.<br>
To reactivate after use, boil the heat pack in water until it is clear and then remove and let cool.<br>
Heat packs may contain sodium acetate, which will freeze at 54 oC in an open container.<br>
However, when this solution is in a sealed container, the solution can be cooled below this temperature, as low as -10 oC.<br>
Flexing a metal "trigger" within the sealed container causes a few molecules of liquid to crystallize, which starts a chain reaction causing the supercooled solution to change from a liquid to a solid as crystals form.<br>
This phase change causes the pack to give out heat.<br>
When the heat pack contents crystallize, its temperature returns to its freezing point.<br>
This supercooled solution can be stored for extended periods and still crystallizes on demand,<br>
Once the unit has given off all of its heat, it is then recycled by heating it in boiling water.<br>
The crystals dissolve in their own water of crystallization, the heat pack returns back to a liquid state and then cools below its freezing temperature.<br>
It is then ready to be activated again.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">14.12 Heat of reaction, iron with oxygen gas, iron powder heat pack, disposable hand warmers<br>
 1. Disposable heat packs are used for transporting small animals that need heat to survive the journey, e.g. sugar gliders.<br>
 Open the outer wrapper and remove the inner pad.<br>
 Shake the contents in open air and heat will begin to be generated in 4-5 minutes.<br>
 Place the heat source in shipping containers.<br>
 After use, dispose of an outer wrapper and expired heat pack.<br>
 The contents are high grade iron powder that undergoes rapid rusting with heat as a by-product, activated charcoal powder, cellulose, zeolite and water.<br>
2. Use an "instant hot pack".<br>
 Remove inner pack.<br>
 Squeeze or shake several times.<br>
 Allow a few minutes to warm up.<br>
 Keep covered in pocket, glove or clothing for maximum warmth.<br>
 Caution: Store in cool dry place.<br>
 The hot pack has an outer plastic bag.<br>
The inside bag is made from cloth or a paper with many tiny holes and contains a mixture of iron powder, salt, charcoal and sawdust, all dampened with water.<br>
 When the paper bag is removed from the plastic bag and shaken vigorously it gets hot.<br>
 Iron is reacting with oxygen gas in the air to make iron oxide or rust.<br>
3. Hand warmers<br>
 To make an air-activated hand warmer, put 25 g of iron powder or very fine iron filings and 1 g of sodium chloride in a small plastic bag.<br>
 Shake the bag to mix.<br>
 Add about a tablespoon of vermiculite or sawdust or sand to the bag and shake well.<br>
 Add 5 mL of water and seal the bag without squashing out all the air.<br>
 Shake the bag vigorously.<br>
 A reaction should start after about a minute.<br>
 4Fe (s) + 3O2 (g) --> 2Fe2O3 (s)<br>
 "Hand warmers" as sold by chemical suppliers contain iron powder, water, sodium chloride, activated charcoal, and vermiculite, in a polypropylene package.<br>
<a name="14.13H">
4. Put iron powder in a plastic bag, e.g. a "Ziploc" bag.<br>
 Add sodium chloride and mix contents by shaking the closed bag.<br>
 Add 1 tablespoon of small vermiculite pieces and mix again.<br>
 Add 5 mL water to the bag and seal with a twist tie.<br>
 Squeeze and shake the bag.<br>
 After 2 minutes feel the bag and observe the heat produced.<br>
 The iron powder and the oxygen in the bag react to form iron oxide.<br>
 Salt speeds this reaction and is therefore a catalyst.<br>
 The vermiculite insulation ensures that the heat stays in the bag.<br>
 The iron oxide formed is a compound.<br>
 2Fe + 3O2 ---> Fe2O3 + heat.<br>
hand warmers make use of the oxidation of iron to achieve an exothermic reaction<br>

Sodium thiosulfate heat pack<br>
 Fill a test-tube 3 / 4 full of sodium thiosulfate crystals.<br>
 Heat the crystals over a Bunsen burner until all of the crystals have melted.<br>
 Let the clear colourless liquid cool to room temperature.<br>

<a name="14.15.2H">
Small pieces of steel, e.g. pins, needles, nails, will not ignite when heated with a lighter or Bunsen burner, because the surface area / volume ratio is too small.<br>
However, a grinding wheel can be used to break steel into tiny pieces and heat them by friction to form incandescent pieces of iron with large surface / volume ratio, that react with oxygen in the air to form sparks.<br>
Pull out strands of steel wool from a steel wool pad and use them to connect the terminals of a 6 volt battery.<br>
The strands become hot caused by the high resistance of the iron and the surface starts to oxidize until all the strands are converted to iron oxides.<br>
The strands burn brighter and faster if you blow on them to increase the oxygen supply.<br>

Add strong black tea to samples of fruit juice, e.g. apple, pineapple, cranberry.<br>

The precipitate may not appear for hours or days and the time for precipitation may depend on the temperature and concentrations of the tea and fruit juice.<br>
Pineapple juice should give the shortest time for precipitation.<br>
The precipitate is formed by a reaction between the ferric, Fe3+, non-haem iron from the fruit juice with the tannins in the black tea.<br>
The non-haem iron is an important component in your diet, but black tea may make this iron indigestible so that we cannot absorb it.<br>

Be careful! The reaction of iron (II) sulfide with hydrochloric acid will form the poisonous gas, hydrogen sulfide, with an odour of rotten eggs.<br>
Experiments
1. Mix half a metal bottle top of powdered sulfur with the same volume of iron filings.<br>
Heat a small portion of the mixture on the metal bottle top with the cork removed or in a hard glass test-tube.<br>
When the reaction begins, i.e. the mixture starts to glow, stop heating by moving the Bunsen burner to the side.<br>
If the glow stops, heat the test-tube again.<br>
The reaction of a mixture of iron with sulfur gives out so much heat that the mixture becomes red hot.<br>
Note the following different properties of powdered sulfur, iron filings and the iron (II) sulfide: | appearance | colour | hardness | magnetism|.<br>
Iron is magnetic so is easily removed from a mixture of iron and sulfur, but iron (II) sulfide is not magnetic.<br>
Fe + S --> FeS (s).<br>
2. Use < 10 g total material iron with sulfur in a fume cupboard.<br>
