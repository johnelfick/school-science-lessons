Organic chemistry is the chemistry of carbon compounds.<br>
The C--C bond is strong, 4 valence electrons on the C atom allow it to join with 4 other atoms, join with atoms of non-,metals, form straight or branched chains.<br> 
Atoms of saturated compounds are linked by single bonds ans unsaturated compounds are linked by double or triple bonds.<br>
Hydrocarbon compounds contain only carbon and hydrogen only.<br>
The main types are the alkanes, alkenes and alkynes.<br>
In alkenes and alkynes, addition reactions occur at the double bonds = or triple bonds ≡.<br>
Triple bond (has 6 electrons in the bond), e.g. Carbon monoxide, C≡O.<br>
Be careful! When heating organic chemicals, do not point the test-tube towards anyone!.<br>
Organic compounds may suddenly vaporize and spurt out of the test-tube!.<br>
1. Classification by molecular framework<br>
* Acyclic compounds have chains of unbranched or branched carbon atoms.<br>
* Carbocyclic compounds have rings of carbon atoms.<br>
* Heterocyclic compounds have rings of carbon atoms with one atom in a ring not carbon, e.g. O, N, S.<br>
2. Names of organic chemicals<br>
Common groups: Cl, chloro | F, fluoro | OH, hydroxy | NH2 amino | NO2 nitro|<br>
Alkyl group: symbol R, from related alkane, e.g. methane, CH4 --> methyl, Ch3, ethane CH6 --> ethyl, C2H5<br>
Alkenes: CnH2n, unsaturated hydrocarbons that contain a double bond, = | ethene, C2H4 | propene, C3H6 |.<br>
Alkynes: CnH2n-2, unsaturated hydrocarbons that contain a triple bond, ≡ | ethyne, C2H2 | propyne, C3H4 |.<br> 
3. Classification by functional group, e.g. hydroxyl group, OH, is characteristic of alcohols.<br>
Functional groups are the qualities of organic chemistry molecules that cause the molecules' characteristic chemical reactions.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.1.2H">16.1.2</a> Addition reactions<br>
An addition reaction occurs when an atom or atoms are added to a double bond or triple bond unsaturated molecule to fom a new molecule.br>
For example, (hydrogenation):<br>
CH2=CH2 (g) + H2 (g) --> CH3CH3 (g)<br>
ethene + hydrogen --> ethane (Pt catalyst)<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.1.3H">16.1.3</a> Oxidation reactions, loss of electrons<br>
 An ankanol is an aliphatic alcohol, e.g. methanol, and is derived from an alkane.<br>
 Primary alcohols can be directly oxidized to aldehydes or carboxylic acids.<br>
 Primary alkanols (alcohols) -CH2-OH --> alkanals (aliphatic aldehydes)<br>
 Example: CH3OH + O2 --> CH2O + H2 (Pt catalyst)<br>
 Oxidation of methanol to methanal using a platinum catalyst<br>
 CH3OH + O2 --> 2HCHO + 2H2O<br>
methanol + oxygen --> methanal + water<br>
 Alkanals --> alkanoic acids, e.g. butanoic acid, CH3(CH2)2COOH<br>
Oxidation of methanol to methanal, platinum catalyst<br>
<a href="../images/16.3.3ch.gif">See diagram 16.3.3</a>: Oxidation of methanol<br>
<b> Be careful! This experiment may be too dangerous for a school science laboratory.</b><br>
Test the experiment in the science preparation room before demonstrating it in the classroom.<br>
Do not let anyone look down into the flask if the experiment appears not to be working!.<br>
Put 10 mL methanol in a flask and heat briefly with a Bunsen burner.<br>
Heat a piece of platinum wire connected to a copper wire until it is red hot.<br>
Hook a copper / platinum wire inside the flask to start the reaction.<br>
Heat the wire again if the reaction does not start.<br>
The reaction continues till all the MeOH is used up.<br>
To stop the reaction, remove the catalyst platinum wire catalyst.<br>
<b>Be careful!</b>.<br>
Methanol is oxidized to methanal when the vapour reaches a certain concentration with a loud "whoosh" sound as the vapour burn and leaves the flask.<br>
The copper T-piece acts as a chimney allowing entry of air when the vapour bums.<br>
The Pt wire changes from red-hot to silver.<br>
CH3OH + O2 --> CH2O + H2 (Pt catalyst).<br>
CH2O + O2 --> CO2 + H2O (Pt catalyst).<br>
Oxidation of methanol to methanal using a platinum catalyst<br>
 CH3OH + O2 --> 2HCHO + 2H2O<br>
methanol + oxygen --> methanal + water<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.1.4H">16.1.4</a> Reduction reactions, gain of electrons<br>
 Alkanals (aliphatic aldehydes) --> primary alkanols (alcohols), -CH2-OH<br>
 Experiment<br>
 Add drops of formalin to a test-tube one quarter filled with Fehling's A and B solutions and heat to boiling.<br>
 Note the yellow then orange then red precipitate of copper (I) oxide.<br>
 The copper from the copper (II) sulfate solution has been reduced from copper (II) to copper (I).<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.1.5">16.1.5</a> Substitution reactions, (displacement reactions)<br>
A substitution reaction occurs when an atom or group in a molecule is replaced by another atom or group.<br>
For example, (chlorination, halogenation): Methane with chlorine<br>
Be Careful! Dangerous experiment!<br>
When a mixture of an alkane and chlorine gas are stored at low temperature in the dark no reaction occurs.<br>
At high temperatures or in sunlight, a substitution exothermic reaction, "chlorination" produces chloromethane, and HCl.<br>
CH4 + Cl2 --> CH3Cl + HCl<br>
Excess chlorine can produce dichloromethane, trichloromethane, and tetrachloromethane.<br>
A mixture of chlorine and methane explodes violently in direct sunlight forming hydrogen chloride and free carbon.<br>
BE CAREFUL! Do not mix chlorine and methane!<br>
CH4 (g) + 2Cl2 (g) --> C (s) + 4HCl (g) + energy<br>
Chloromethane, CH3Cl, (methyl chloride)<br>
Dichloromethane, CH2Cl2, (methylene chloride)<br>
Trichloromethane, CHCl3, (chloroform)<br>
Tetrachloromethane, CCl4, (carbon tetrachloride)<br>

 Acyl chloride (RCOCl), e.g. ethanoyl chloride, Acetyl chloride, CH3COCl.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.1.9H">16.1.9</a> Acrylamide<br>
 Acrylamide, C3H5NO, 2-propenamide, ethylene carboxamide, acrylic amide, propenoic acid, UN 2074, vinyl amide, is toxic if ingested,
 crystalline form and aqueous solutions, monomer or polymer.<br>
Acrylamide, C3H5NO, CH2CHCONH2, is the amide of acrylic acid, propenoic acid CH2CHCOOH, an unsaturated liquid carboxylic acid.<br>
Acrylamide is a poison, harmful if swallowed, inhaled or absorbed through skin, affects central and peripheral nervous systems and reproductive system.<br>
It causes irritation to skin, eyes and respiratory tract, suspected cancer hazard depending on level and duration of exposure, possible birth defect hazard.<br>
It is thermally unstable, but can polymerize explosively if heated to the melting point.<br>
It is most common in overcooked French fries and potato chips, also burned toast and burned high carbohydrate foods.<br>
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recommends consuming golden not dark brown or black toast, short espresso not lungo, and not overcooked foods.<br>
Acrylamide is a toxic chemical which could cause tumours.<br>
It is not deliberately added to food by manufacturers, it is a by-product of the cooking process and has always been around.<br>
A lot of research has been done into the chemical's effect on humans, first highlighted as a potential risk in a 2002 Swedish study.<br>
In 2015, the European Food Standard Agency (EFSA) published its first full risk assessment of acrylamide in food, 
which found that the chemical potentially increases the risk of cancer for all age groups.<br>
FSA: "This means that acrylamide might contribute to your lifetime risk of developing cancer, but it is not possible to estimate how big this contribution may be.<br>
Eating too much processed and red meat, and cooking meat at high temperatures on grills and BBQs, could also increase your cancer risk.<br>
"Coffee has been shown to be a healthy beverage." said William Murray, president the National Coffee Association, in reaction to the decision.<br>
A previous case resulted in potato-chip makers agreeing in 2008 to pay $3 million and remove acrylamide from their products.<br>
The chip-makers opted to do that rather than post cancer warnings like those that are found, and largely ignored, throughout California.<br>
He argued the lawsuit "does nothing to improve public health.".<br>
Kathryn M. Wilson, Harvard University, told the LA Times: "I think the evidence that acrylamide makes a difference for human cancer risk is pretty weak.".<br>
31/3/2018 LOS ANGELES.<br>
A Los Angeles judge determined that coffee companies must carry a cancer warning label, because of a chemical produced in the roasting process.<br>
The judge said Wednesday that Starbucks and other companies failed to show that benefits from drinking coffee outweighed any risks.<br>
He ruled in an earlier phase of trial that companies had not shown the threat from the chemical was insignificant.<br>
The Council for Education and Research on Toxics, a nonprofit group, sued Starbucks and 90 other companies as follows:<br>
Under a state law that requires warnings on a wide range of chemicals that can cause cancer, including acrylamide, a carcinogen present in coffee.<br>

Amides, acid amides (-amide) (amide group: -CONH2, RCONH2<br>
 Suffix: -amide, e.g. urea, H2NC=ONH2<br>
 [IUPAC says: Do NOT distinguish amides with NH2, NHR, NR2 groups by the terms "primary, secondary, tertiary".]<br>
1. Primary amides RCONH2, e.g. alkanamides: ethanamide (acetamide), CH3CONH2 propanamide C2H5CONH2.<br>
2. Secondary amides, N-substituted amides RCONHR'.<br>
3. Tertiary amides RCNR'R".<br>

 (the polymer group -CO-NH-)<br>
 inorganic amides, e.g. KNH2.<br>
Aramids<br>
Aramids are aromatic polyamides, amide groups (–CO–NH–) bound directly to two aromatic rings, e.g. "Kevlar", "Nomex".<br> 
Aramid fibres are made by spinning liquid crystal aramid polymers to long chain polymer molecules with remarkable strength.<br>
The polymer chains are linked laterally by hydrogen bonds, used in rope and textile high performance fibres.<br>
<a name="KevlarH">"Kevlar"</a>, is a synthetic fibre with of high-tensile strength, is used as a reinforcing material for the rubber in motor vehicle tyres and tie-wires
Kevlar is synthesized from 1,4-phenylene-diamine and terephthaloyl chloride in a condensation reaction.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.1.11H">16.1.11</a> Bleaches<br>
A bleach can cause animal fibres or cloth to lose colour and become white.<br>
Exposure to sunlight can cause bleaching.<br>
A bleach is a chemical to remove colour or whiten fabric.<br>
Sodium hypochlorite solution is called "liquid bleach".<br>
A formulation containing calcium hypochlorite is called a bleaching powder"<br>
Most bleaches are oxidizing agents, so the powerful oxidizer chlorine is the active agent in many leaches as a hypochlorite, to release chlorine.<br>
Non-chlorine bleaches are usually peroxides, e,g, hydrogen peroxide, sodium percarbonate, and sodium perborate.<br>
Sulfur dioxide, is used to bleach wool.<br>
Sodium and calcium hypochlorite are used primarily as household bleaching agents or disinfectants..<br> 
They are components of commercial bleaches, cleaning solutions, and disinfectants for drinking water and waste water purification systems and swimming pools..<br>
Sodium hypochlorite, NaClO, NaOCl, known as "bleach"or "chlorine bleach" is used dissolved in water for domestic bleaching of clothes.<br>
It is a clear, green to yellow liquids with an odour of chlorine.<br>
Calcium hypochlorite, Ca(ClO)2, Ca(OCl)2, calcium hypochloride, is a white solid that readily decomposes in water releasing oxygen and chlorine.<br> 
Calcium hypochlorite is a white granular solid, (or tablets compressed from the granules, with an odour of chlorine, toxic, irritating to the skin.<br> 
It is used for water purification, disinfectant for swimming pools, for bleaching paper and textiles.<br>
Bleaches used in swimming pools<br>

ethanol + carbamic acid --> urethane
Urethanes are esters of carbamic acid, i.e. alkyl carbamates.<br>
Polymers that include repeating carbamate units, -NH (CO)O-. are called polyurethanes<br>
Polyurethanes are from the polymerization of isocyanates.<br>
Examples of carbamates: carbamic acid, ammonium carbamate, bendiocarb, carbaryl, urethane.<br>
Combustion of carbamates may produce noxious NOx and carbon monoxide.<br>
Carbamates are more reactive than amides and can form polyurethane resins.<br>
Carbamates are incompatible with strong acids and bases, strong oxidizing acids, and peroxides.<br>

Consumption of methylated spirits<br>
Do not consume methylated spirits.
If methylated spirits is swallowed, do NOT induce vomiting, because it may enter the lungs.<br>
Flammability of methylated spirits<br>
Methylated spirit is highly flammable and must not be used near naked flames.<br>
It must be boiled in a beaker or set on wire gauze over a Bunsen burner to extract chlorophyll from leaves.<br>
Do not heat methylated spirit over a Bunsen burner, even in a closed container such as a flask with a reflux condenser, because the flask may crack.<br>
Methylated spirit burns with a nearly colourless flame, so if there is a fire, be careful of the invisible flames.<br>
Use a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher and fire blankets to smother the flames.<br>
Heating methylated spirits<br>
Use a water bath to heat methylated spirit in a flask, so if the flask cracks, a mixture of water and methylated spirit is less flammable than pure methylated spirit.<br>
Handling methylated spirits<br>
Repeated contact of the skin with methylated spirit can cause dermatitis, so wear rubber gloves if using methylated spirit as a solvent for cleaning.<br>
Mixing methylated spirits<br>
Do not mix methylated spirit with an oxidizing acid, e.g. concentrated nitric acid, because a vigorous reaction or explosion may occur.<br>
Uses of methylated spirits<br>
Use methylated spirit as a cheap low toxicity cleaning solvent for solvent extraction.<br>

Octane is in some hydrocarbons with unbranched carbon chains, which prematurely explode in the cylinder.<br>
They produce an audible knocking sound or "ping" sound (knocking, pinking).<br>
A scale of "knock property" has isooctane (2,2,4-trimethylpentane) at 100 (a good fuel) and heptane at 0 (a poor fuel).<br>
So gasoline with octane number 80 has the same properties as a mixture of 80% isooctane and 29% heptane.<br>
Octane number is the percentage of iso-octane normal heptane mix with the same knocking behaviour of the fuel being tested.<br>
Octane number indicates the knock rating of a motor fuel.<br>
A high octane fuel has a longer self-ignition delay in motor car engine.<br>
In Brisbane, most "family cars" use 91 octane "unleaded petrol".<br>
This is the lowest octane rating of the different petrol sold in garages.<br>
A high octane rating of a fuel means that it has less tendency to pre-ignite in a high compression engine.<br>
Pre-ignition means that before the spark plug has fired, the fuel air mixture burns, because of heat created in the cylinder by compression.<br>
Unleaded petrol has the octane rating 98.<br>
