Organic chemistry is the chemistry of carbon compounds.<br>
The C--C bond is strong, 4 valence electrons on the C atom allow it to join with 4 other atoms, join with atoms of non-,metals, form straight or branched chains.<br> 
Atoms of saturated compounds are linked by single bonds ans unsaturated compounds are linked by double or triple bonds.<br>
Hydrocarbon compounds contain only carbon and hydrogen only.<br>
The main types are the alkanes, alkenes and alkynes.<br>
In alkenes and alkynes, addition reactions occur at the double bonds = or triple bonds ≡.<br>
Triple bond (has 6 electrons in the bond), e.g. Carbon monoxide, C≡O.<br>
Be careful! When heating organic chemicals, do not point the test-tube towards anyone!.<br>
Organic compounds may suddenly vaporize and spurt out of the test-tube!.<br>
1. Classification by molecular framework<br>
* Acyclic compounds have chains of unbranched or branched carbon atoms.<br>
* Carbocyclic compounds have rings of carbon atoms.<br>
* Heterocyclic compounds have rings of carbon atoms with one atom in a ring not carbon, e.g. O, N, S.<br>
 2. Classification by functional group, e.g. hydroxyl group, OH, is characteristic of alcohols.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.1.1H">16.1.1</a> Addition reactions<br>
An addition reaction occurs when an atom or atoms are added to a double bond or triple bond unsaturated molecule to fom a new molecule.br>
For example, (hydrogenation):<br>
CH2=CH2 (g) + H2 (g) --> CH3CH3 (g)<br>
ethene + hydrogen --> ethane (Pt catalyst)<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.1.2H">16.1.2</a> Oxidation reactions, loss of electrons<br>
 Primary alcohols can be directly oxidized to aldehydes or carboxylic acids.<br>
 Primary alkanols (alcohols) -CH2-OH --> alkanals (aliphatic aldehydes)<br>
 Example: CH3OH + O2 --> CH2O + H2 (Pt catalyst)<br>
 Oxidation of methanol to methanal using a platinum catalyst<br>
 CH3OH + O2 --> 2HCHO + 2H2O<br>
methanol + oxygen --> methanal + water<br>
 Alkanals --> alkanoic acids, e.g. butanoic acid, CH3(CH2)2COOH<br>zzz
Oxidation of methanol to methanal, platinum catalyst<br>
<a href="../images/16.3.3ch.gif">See diagram 16.3.3</a>: Oxidation of methanol<br>
<b> Be careful! This experiment may be too dangerous for a school science laboratory.</b><br>
Test the experiment in the science preparation room before demonstrating it in the classroom.<br>
Do not let anyone look down into the flask if the experiment appears not to be working!.<br>
Put 10 mL methanol in a flask and heat briefly with a Bunsen burner.<br>
Heat a piece of platinum wire connected to a copper wire until it is red hot.<br>
Hook a copper / platinum wire inside the flask to start the reaction.<br>
Heat the wire again if the reaction does not start.<br>
The reaction continues till all the MeOH is used up.<br>
To stop the reaction, remove the catalyst platinum wire catalyst.<br>
<b>Be careful!</b>.<br>
Methanol is oxidized to methanal when the vapour reaches a certain concentration with a loud "whoosh" sound as the vapour burn and leaves the flask.<br>
The copper T-piece acts as a chimney allowing entry of air when the vapour bums.<br>
The Pt wire changes from red-hot to silver.<br>
CH3OH + O2 --> CH2O + H2 (Pt catalyst).<br>
CH2O + O2 --> CO2 + H2O (Pt catalyst).<br>
Oxidation of methanol to methanal using a platinum catalyst<br>
 CH3OH + O2 --> 2HCHO + 2H2O<br>
methanol + oxygen --> methanal + water<br>

 Alkanals (aliphatic aldehydes) --> primary alkanols (alcohols), -CH2-OH<br>
 Experiment<br>
 Add drops of formalin to a test-tube one quarter filled with Fehling's A and B solutions and heat to boiling.<br>
 Note the yellow then orange then red precipitate of copper (I) oxide.<br>
 The copper from the copper (II) sulfate solution has been reduced from copper (II) to copper (I).<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.1.4H">16.1.4</a> Substitution reactions, (displacement reactions)<br>
A substitution reaction occurs when an atom or group in a molecule is replaced by another atom or group.<br>
For example, (chlorination, halogenation): Methane with chlorine<br>
Be Careful! Dangerous experiment!<br>
When a mixture of an alkane and chlorine gas are stored at low temperature in the dark no reaction occurs.<br>
At high temperatures or in sunlight, a substitution exothermic reaction, "chlorination" produces chloromethane, and HCl.<br>
CH4 + Cl2 --> CH3Cl + HCl<br>
Excess chlorine can produce dichloromethane, trichloromethane, and tetrachloromethane.<br>
A mixture of chlorine and methane explodes violently in direct sunlight forming hydrogen chloride and free carbon.<br>
BE CAREFUL! Do not mix chlorine and methane!<br>
CH4 (g) + 2Cl2 (g) --> C (s) + 4HCl (g) + energy<br>
Chloromethane, CH3Cl, (methyl chloride)<br>
Dichloromethane, CH2Cl2, (methylene chloride)<br>
Trichloromethane, CHCl3, (chloroform)<br>

<a href="../images/16.13.7chd.gif">See diagram 16.13.7</a>: Carbamates, carbaryl, methiocarb.<br>
Carbamate ion, CH2NO2-, is a derivatives of carbamic acid, NH2COOH, H2NC(=O)OH<br>
Carbamates are esters of carbamic acid, CH2NO2-, NH2COOH.<br>
Carbamate esters are called urethanes.
A urethane, C3H7NO2, NH2COOC2H5 is the ethyl ester of carbamic acid and is found in alcoholic beverages
ethanol + carbamic acid --> urethane
Urethanes are esters of carbamic acid, i.e. alkyl carbamates.<br>
Polymers that include repeating carbamate units, -NH (CO)O-. are called polyurethanes<br>
Polyurethanes are from the polymerization of isocyanates.<br>
Examples of carbamates: carbamic acid, ammonium carbamate, bendiocarb, carbaryl, urethane.<br>
Combustion of carbamates may produce noxious NOx and carbon monoxide.<br>
Carbamates are more reactive than amides and can form polyurethane resins.<br>
Carbamates are incompatible with strong acids and bases, strong oxidizing acids, and peroxides.<br>
Many carbamates are used as pesticides for their anticholinesterase activity, e.g. carbaryl, propoxur, bendiocarb and methomyl.<br>

 Acrylamide, C3H5NO, 2-propenamide, ethylene carboxamide, acrylic amide, propenoic acid, UN 2074, vinyl amide, is toxic if ingested,
 crystalline form and aqueous solutions, monomer or polymer.<br>
Acrylamide, C3H5NO, CH2CHCONH2, is the amide of acrylic acid, propenoic acid CH2CHCOOH, an unsaturated liquid carboxylic acid.<br>
Acrylamide is a poison, harmful if swallowed, inhaled or absorbed through skin, affects central and peripheral nervous systems and reproductive system.<br>
It causes irritation to skin, eyes and respiratory tract, suspected cancer hazard depending on level and duration of exposure, possible birth defect hazard.<br>
It is thermally unstable, but can polymerize explosively if heated to the melting point.<br>
It is most common in overcooked French fries and potato chips, also burned toast and burned high carbohydrate foods.<br>
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recommends consuming golden not dark brown or black toast, short espresso not lungo, and not overcooked foods.<br>
Acrylamide is a toxic chemical which could cause tumours.<br>
It is not deliberately added to food by manufacturers, it is a by-product of the cooking process and has always been around.<br>
A lot of research has been done into the chemical's effect on humans, first highlighted as a potential risk in a 2002 Swedish study.<br>
In 2015, the European Food Standard Agency (EFSA) published its first full risk assessment of acrylamide in food, 
which found that the chemical potentially increases the risk of cancer for all age groups.<br>
FSA: "This means that acrylamide might contribute to your lifetime risk of developing cancer, but it is not possible to estimate how big this contribution may be.<br>
Eating too much processed and red meat, and cooking meat at high temperatures on grills and BBQs, could also increase your cancer risk.<br>
"Coffee has been shown to be a healthy beverage." said William Murray, president the National Coffee Association, in reaction to the decision.<br>
A previous case resulted in potato-chip makers agreeing in 2008 to pay $3 million and remove acrylamide from their products.<br>
The chip-makers opted to do that rather than post cancer warnings like those that are found, and largely ignored, throughout California.<br>
He argued the lawsuit "does nothing to improve public health.".<br>
Kathryn M. Wilson, Harvard University, told the LA Times: "I think the evidence that acrylamide makes a difference for human cancer risk is pretty weak.".<br>
31/3/2018 LOS ANGELES.<br>
A Los Angeles judge determined that coffee companies must carry a cancer warning label, because of a chemical produced in the roasting process.<br>
The judge said Wednesday that Starbucks and other companies failed to show that benefits from drinking coffee outweighed any risks.<br>
He ruled in an earlier phase of trial that companies had not shown the threat from the chemical was insignificant.<br>
The Council for Education and Research on Toxics, a nonprofit group, sued Starbucks and 90 other companies as follows:<br>
Under a state law that requires warnings on a wide range of chemicals that can cause cancer, including acrylamide, a carcinogen present in coffee.<br>

Consumption of methylated spirits<br>
Do not consume methylated spirits.
If methylated spirits is swallowed, do NOT induce vomiting, because it may enter the lungs.<br>
Flammability of methylated spirits<br>
Methylated spirit is highly flammable and must not be used near naked flames.<br>
It must be boiled in a beaker or set on wire gauze over a Bunsen burner to extract chlorophyll from leaves.<br>
Do not heat methylated spirit over a Bunsen burner, even in a closed container such as a flask with a reflux condenser, because the flask may crack.<br>
Methylated spirit burns with a nearly colourless flame, so if there is a fire, be careful of the invisible flames.<br>
Use a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher and fire blankets to smother the flames.<br>
Heating methylated spirits<br>
Use a water bath to heat methylated spirit in a flask, so if the flask cracks, a mixture of water and methylated spirit is less flammable than pure methylated spirit.<br>
Handling methylated spirits<br>
Repeated contact of the skin with methylated spirit can cause dermatitis, so wear rubber gloves if using methylated spirit as a solvent for cleaning.<br>
Mixing methylated spirits<br>
Do not mix methylated spirit with an oxidizing acid, e.g. concentrated nitric acid, because a vigorous reaction or explosion may occur.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.7.7H">16.7.7</a> Nitrites<br>
Nitrites (NO2-), dioxonitrate ion, salts or esters of nitrous acid, HNO2, (O=NOH)<br>
Nitrites group: -C=N, Suffix: -nitrite, e.g. sodium nitrite NaNO2, potassium nitrite KNO2, used as meat curing agents.<br> 
Reactions of nitrites<br>
Use a fume cupboard for these experiments.<br>
The oxide N2O3 is unstable at temperatures above 
-21 oC and decomposes into nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide.<br>
N2O3 --> NO + NO2.<br>
1. Add dilute hydrochloric acid to sodium nitrite solution.<br>
Note the solution turns pale blue with effervescence and brown fumes are given off.<br>
Acids react with nitrites to produce unstable nitrous acid that decomposes into nitric oxide and oxygen.<br>
The oxygen oxidizes nitrous acid to nitric acid.<br>
3NO3- + 2H + --> NO3- + H2O + 2NO<br>
Finally, the nitric oxide finally reacts with the oxygen of the air to form nitrogen dioxide<br>
2NO + O2 --> 2NO2.<br>
2. Mix iron (II) sulfate solution and sodium nitrite solution.<br>
Add drops of dilute sulfuric acid.<br>
The solution turns brown, because of the loose compound that iron (II) 
 sulfate makes with nitric oxide.<br>
This test distinguishes between a nitrite and a nitrate.<br>
3. Add drops of concentrated hydrochloric acid to two mL of potassium iodide solution.<br>
Pour the mixture into sodium nitrite solution.<br>
Iodine forms as a brown colour or a black precipitate, because of the
oxidation of potassium iodide to iodine.<br>
Iodide ion is oxidized by electron loss and nitrous acid is reduced by electron gain.<br>
2I- - 2e- --> I2<br>
2HNO3 + 2H + + 2e- --> 2H2O + 2NO<br>
2HNO3 + 2H + + 2I- --> 2H2O + I2 + 2NO<br>
Finally, the nitric oxide finally reacts with the oxygen of the air to form nitrogen dioxide<br>
2NO + O2 --> 2NO2<br>
The nitrous acid acts as an oxidizing agent.<br>
2NO2- + 4H + + 2e- --> 2H2O + 2NO (electron gain).<br>
4. Pass hydrogen sulfide into sodium nitrite solution acidified with dilute hydrochloric acid.<br>
Note the rapid reaction, the precipitate of sulfur and the brown fumes.<br>
Sulfide ions from the partially ionized hydrogen sulfide lose electrons and are oxidized.<br>
Nitrite ions accept these electrons and are reduced.<br>
S2- - 2e- --> S<br>
2NO2- + 4H + + 2e- --> 2H2O + 2NO<br>
2NO2- + 4H + + S2- --> 2H2O + 2NO + S<br>
The nitrous acid acts as an oxidizing agent.<br>
2NO2- + 4H + + 2e- --> 2H2O + 2NO (electron gain).<br>
<a name="12.18.2.0H"></a>
5. Add a piece of copper to sodium nitrite solution acidified with dilute sulfuric acid.<br>
Note the rapid reaction to attack the copper and the solution turns blue.<br>
The nitrous acid acts as an oxidizing agent.<br>
2NO2- + 4H + + 2e- --> 2H2O + 2NO (electron gain).<br>
6. Add sodium nitrite solution to bromine water acidified with dilute sulfuric acid.<br>
The bromine water loses its colour, because of reduction to hydrobromic acid.<br>
The bromine is reduced to bromide ions by accepting electrons, the nitrite ion is oxidized and so acts as a reducing agent by supplying the electrons.<br>
Br2 + 2e- --> 2Br-<br>
NO2- + H2O --> NO3-+ 2H+ + 2e-<br>
NO2- + H2O + Br2 --> 
 NO3-+ 2H + + 2Br-<br>
The nitrous acid acts as a reducing agent and is oxidized to nitric acid.<br>
No gas is given off.<br>
If the free nitrous acid is in excess, it will decompose into nitric acid and oxygen.<br>
H2O + NO2- --> NO3- + 2H+ + 2e- (electron loss)<br>
If the free nitrous acid is in excess, decomposition occurs.<br>
7. Add sodium nitrite solution to potassium permanganate solution acidified with dilute sulfuric acid.<br>
The solution loses its colour.<br>
The permanganate ion oxidizes and the nitrite ion reduces and is itself oxidized.<br>
MnO4- + 8H+ + 5e- --> Mn2+ + 4H2O (electron gain)<br>
H2O + NO2- - 2e- --> NO3-+ 2H+ (electron loss)<br>
5NO3- + 2MnO4- + 6H+ --> 5NO3- + 2Mn2+ + 3H2O<br>
The nitrous acid acts as a reducing agent and is oxidized to nitric acid.<br>
No gas is given off.<br>
If the free nitrous acid is in excess, it will decompose into nitricacid and oxygen.<br>
H2O + NO2- --> NO3- + 2H+ + 2e- (electron loss)<br>
If the free nitrous acid is in excess, decomposition occurs.<br>
8. Add ammonium chloride solution to sodium nitrite solution.<br>
Heat the solution and observe the effervescence and the colourless odourless gas given off.<br>
The gas gives negative results for the limewater test, litmus test, and lighted splint test.<br>
The gas is nitrogen.<br>
NH4+ + NO2- --> 2H2O + N2 (g).<br>
9. Nitrosamines, produced by nitrous acid with secondary amines, can be formed in the gut when nitrites react with amino acids.<br>

 Arenes, aromatic hydrocarbons, are cyclic unsaturated compounds, the simplest being benzene, C6H6.<br>
 Arenes, e.g. benzene, naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene<br>
 Arenes do not mix with water, but they do mix with hydrocarbons and all non-polar solvents.<br>
 Arenes usually burn with a smoky flame, as do most aromatic compounds, because of the high carbon: nitrogen ratio.<br>
 So when they burn in air, some carbon soot usually remains in the air.<br>
 Arenes are called aromatic compounds, because the first arenes were isolated from fragrant oils.<br>
 However, nowadays aromatic refers to the structure, not the smell.<br>

Octane is in some hydrocarbons with unbranched carbon chains, which prematurely explode in the cylinder.<br>
They produce an audible knocking sound or "ping" sound (knocking, pinking).<br>
A scale of "knock property" has isooctane (2,2,4-trimethylpentane) at 100 (a good fuel) and heptane at 0 (a poor fuel).<br>
So gasoline with octane number 80 has the same properties as a mixture of 80% isooctane and 29% heptane.<br>
Octane number is the percentage of iso-octane normal heptane mix with the same knocking behaviour of the fuel being tested.<br>
Octane number indicates the knock rating of a motor fuel.<br>
A high octane fuel has a longer self-ignition delay in motor car engine.<br>
In Brisbane, most "family cars" use 91 octane "unleaded petrol".<br>
This is the lowest octane rating of the different petrol sold in garages.<br>
A high octane rating of a fuel means that it has less tendency to pre-ignite in a high compression engine.<br>
Pre-ignition means that before the spark plug has fired, the fuel air mixture burns, because of heat created in the cylinder by compression.<br>
Unleaded petrol has the octane rating 98.<br>
