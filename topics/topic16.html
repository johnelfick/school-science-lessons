Organic chemistry is the chemistry of carbon compounds.<br>
Hydrocarbons contain carbon and hydrogen only.<br>
The main types are the alkanes, alkenes and alkynes.<br>
In alkenes and alkynes, addition reactions occur at the double bonds = or triple bonds ≡.<br>
Triple bond (has 6 electrons in the bond), e.g. Carbon monoxide, C≡O.<br>
Be careful! When heating organic chemicals, do not point the test-tube towards anyone!.<br>
Organic compounds may suddenly vaporize and spurt out of the test-tube!.<br>
1. Classification by molecular framework<br>
1.1 Acyclic compounds have chains of unbranched or branched carbon atoms.<br>
1.2 Carbocyclic compounds have rings of carbon atoms.<br>
1.3 Heterocyclic compounds have rings of carbon atoms with one atom in a ring not carbon, e.g. O, N, S.<br>
 2. Classification by functional group, e.g. hydroxyl group, OH, is characteristic of alcohols.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.1.01H">16.1.01</a> Addition reactions<br>
An addition reaction occurs when an atom or atoms are added to a double bond or triple bond unsaturated molecule to fom a new molecule.br>
For example, (hydrogenation):<br>
CH2=CH2 (g) + H2 (g) --> CH3CH3 (g)<br>
ethene + hydrogen --> ethane (Pt catalyst)<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.1.02H">16.1.02</a> Substitution reactions, (displacement reactions)<br>
A substitution reaction occurs when an atom or group in a molecule is replaced by another atom or group.<br>
For example, (chlorination, halogenation): Methane with chlorine<br>
Be Careful! Dangerous experiment!<br>
When a mixture of an alkane and chlorine gas are stored at low temperature in the dark no reaction occurs.<br>
At high temperatures or in sunlight, a substitution exothermic reaction, "chlorination" produces chloromethane, and HCl.<br>
CH4 + Cl2 --> CH3Cl + HCl<br>
Excess chlorine can produce dichloromethane, trichloromethane, and tetrachloromethane.<br>
A mixture of chlorine and methane explodes violently in direct sunlight forming hydrogen chloride and free carbon.<br>
BE CAREFUL! Do not mix chlorine and methane!<br>
CH4 (g) + 2Cl2 (g) --> C (s) + 4HCl (g) + energy<br>
Chloromethane, CH3Cl, (methyl chloride)<br>
Dichloromethane, CH2Cl2, (methylene chloride)<br>
Trichloromethane, CHCl3, (chloroform)<br>
Tetrachloromethane, CCl4, (carbon tetrachloride)<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.1.03H">16.1.03</a> Oxidation reactions, loss of electrons<br>
 Primary alcohols can be directly oxidized to aldehydes or carboxylic acids.<br>
 Primary alkanols (alcohols) -CH2-OH --> alkanals (aliphatic aldehydes)<br>
 Example: CH3OH + O2 --> CH2O + H2 (Pt catalyst)<br>
Oxidation of methanol to methanal using a platinum catalyst<br>
CH3OH + O2 --> 2HCHO + 2H2O<br>
methanol + oxygen --> methanal + water<br>
 Alkanals --> alkanoic acids, e.g. butanoic acid, CH3(CH2)2COOH<br>
 Secondary alkanols (alcohols) (CH3)2CHOH --> alkanones<br>

<a name="AlkanonesH">Alkanones</a>, (ketones, RCOR'), simplest ketone: acetone (2-propanone, dimethyl ketone), C3H6O<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.1.04H">16.1.04</a> Reduction reactions, gain of electrons<br>
 Alkanals (aliphatic aldehydes) --> primary alkanols (alcohols), -CH2-OH<br>
 Experiment<br>
 Add drops of formalin to a test-tube one quarter filled with Fehling's A and B solutions and heat to boiling.<br>
 Note the yellow then orange then red precipitate of copper (I) oxide.<br>
 The copper from the copper (II) sulfate solution has been reduced from copper (II) to copper (I).<br>

 <a href="../images/16.1.1chd.gif">See diagram 16.1.1</a>: Alkanes, alkenes, alkynes.<br>
 Alkanes, alkenes, alkynes or their derivatives are aliphatic compounds, i.e. non-cyclic organic compounds.<br>
 Acyclic molecules have carbon atoms in chains, but not in rings.<br>
 The chains may be unbranched or branched.<br>
 Aromatic compounds contain a benzene ring in the molecule.<br>
 Hydrocarbon compounds contain only hydrogen and carbon.<br>
 Hydrocarbons are usually colourless and have low solubility in water.<br>
 Crude oil is a mixture of hydrocarbons.<br>
 Hydrocarbons may be saturated, i.e. have only single bonds, or unsaturated, i.e. contain multiple bonds, e.g. double bond =, or triple bond, carbon monoxide, C≡O.<br>
<a name="IodinevalueH">Iodine value</a>, the number of grams of iodine absorbed by 100 g of fat or oil, to indicate the amount of unsaturated acids.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.4.1.1H">16.4.1.1</a> Alkanes CnH2n+2, paraffins<br>
Alkanes (paraffins): aliphatic hydrocarbons with only single bonds, i.e. just C-C, C-H single bonds<br>
Alkanes, cyclohexane, heptane, hexane, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), octane, pentane, petroleum spirit<br>
Alkanes: methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, nonane<br>
The first 10 unbranched alkanes and molecular formula: methane CH4, ethane C2H6, propane CH3H8, butane CH4H10, pentane CH5H12, hexane CH6H14, heptane CH7H16, octane CH8H18, nonane CH9H20, decane CH10H22<br>
Alkanes burn in oxygen to give carbon dioxide and water.<br>
Candle wax is a mixture of different alkanes that are solid at room temperature.<br>
Alkanes are usually associated with natural petroleum deposits and can be distilled from petroleum.<br>
1. Alkanes (paraffins) are saturated hydrocarbons, i.e. all single bonds between C atoms, have formula CnH2n<sup>+2</sup> and names end in "ane".<br>
The names of unbranched alkanes come from the number of carbon atoms.<br>
The name of branched alkanes come from the longest chain of carbon atoms.<br>
The hydrocarbon branches, alkyl groups, symbol R, are formed by removing one hydrogen atom from the alkane and named by changing the "ane" to "yl", e.g. methane, CH4 to methyl, CH3<sup>-</sup>, also "Me".<br>
The carbon atoms of the longest continuous name are numbered starting at the end of the chain closest to the first branch, e.g. an eight carbon chain with an ethyl group attached to carbon 5 and a methyl group attached to carbon 3 and carbon 4 is called 5-ethyl-3, 4-dimethyloctane.<br>
Saturated hydrocarbons, e.g. hexane C6H14, all carbons have either four or three hydrogens bonded to them and no double bonds, triple bonds or rings, react in almost the same way.<br>
Formation of alkanes:<br>
* Hydrogenation of alkenes --> alkanes<br>
 CH2=CH2 + H2 --> CH3-CH3 (Pt catalyst)<br>
 ethylene + hydrogen --> ethane<br>
 CH3CH=CHCH3 + H2 --> CH3CH2CH2CH3 (Pt catalyst)<br>
* Decarboxylation (remove CO2) from molecules that have -COOH group<br>
 RCOONa + NaOH --> R-H + Na2CO3 (dry distillation with soda lime)<br>
 CH3COONa + NaOH --> CH4 + Na2CO3<br>
 

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.4.1.2H">16.4.1.2</a> Cycloalkanes<br>
 Cycloalkanes, CnH2n, cycloolefins, cyclanes, polymethylenes, cycloparaffins, saturated carbon rings<br>
 Cycloalkanes are saturated hydrocarbons with a ring of carbon atoms, e.g. the position of branches depends on the alphabetical order of the branch names so that highest in order is attached to carbon 1, e.g. 1-ethyl-2-methylcyclopropane.<br>
 Cyclopropane C3H6, colourless gas, former anaesthetic, petroleum odour, is easily ignited, may cause frostbite, containers may explode.<br>
 Cyclobutane C4H8, tetramethylene, condenses to liquid at 13<sup>o</sup>C, insoluble in water, containers may explode.<br>
 Cyclopentane C5H10, pentametylene, colourless liquid, flash point -37<sup>o</sup>C, is insoluble in water.<br>
 Cycloheptane C7H14, heptamethylene, colourless oily liquid, flash point 16<sup>o</sup>C, narcotic effect<br>
 Cyclooctane C8H16, octamethylene<br>

<a href="../topics/topicIndexB.html#BenzeneH">Benzene</a>, C6H6, has a stable six-sided ring structure.<br>
 Arenes, e.g. benzene, naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene<br>
 Arenes do not mix with water, but they do mix with hydrocarbons and all non-polar solvents.<br>
 Arenes usually burn with a smoky flame, as do most aromatic compounds, because of the high carbon: nitrogen ratio.<br>
 So when they burn in air, some carbon soot usually remains in the air.<br>
 Arenes are called aromatic compounds, because the first arenes were isolated from fragrant oils.<br>
 However, nowadays aromatic refers to the structure, not the smell.<br>

Some hydrocarbons with unbranched carbon chains prematurely explode in the cylinder and produce an audible knocking sound or "ping" sound (knocking, pinking).<br>
A scale of "knock property" has isooctane (2,2,4-trimethylpentane) at 100 (a good fuel) and heptane at 0 (a poor fuel).<br>
So gasoline with octane number 80 has the same properties as a mixture of 80% isooctane and 29% heptane.<br>
Octane number is the percentage of iso-octane normal heptane mix with the same knocking behaviour of the fuel being tested, so it indicates the knock rating of a motor fuel.<br>
A high octane fuel has a longer self-ignition delay in motor car engine.<br>
In Brisbane, most "family cars" use 91 octane "unleaded petrol".<br>
This is the lowest octane rating of the different petrol sold in garages.<br>
A high octane rating of a fuel means that it has less tendency to pre-ignite in a high compression engine.<br>
Pre-ignition means that before the spark plug has fired, the fuel air mixture burns, because of heat created in the cylinder by compression.<br>
Unleaded petrol has the octane rating 98.<br>

 Acrylamide, C3H5NO, 2-propenamide, ethylene carboxamide, acrylic amide, propenoic acid, UN 2074, vinyl amide, is toxic if ingested, crystalline form and aqueous solutions, monomer or polymer.<br>
 Polyacrylamides: <a href="appendixD.html#3.7.3.0H">3.7.3.0</a>.<br>
Acrylamide, C3H5NO, CH2CHCONH2, is the amide of acrylic acid, propenoic acid CH2CHCOOH, an unsaturated liquid carboxylic acid.<br>
Acrylamide is a poison, harmful if swallowed, inhaled or absorbed through skin, affects central and peripheral nervous systems and reproductive system.<br>
It causes irritation to skin, eyes and respiratory tract, suspected cancer hazard depending on level and duration of exposure, possible birth defect hazard.<br>
It is thermally unstable, but can polymerize explosively if heated to the melting point.<br>
It is most common in overcooked French fries and potato chips, also burned toast and burned high carbohydrate foods.<br>
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recommends consuming golden rather than dark brown or black toast, short espresso rather than lungo, and avoiding overcooked foods.<br>
Acrylamide is a toxic chemical which could cause tumours.<br>
It is not deliberately added to food by manufacturers, it is a by-product of the cooking process and has always been around.<br>
A lot of research has been done into the chemical's effect on humans, first highlighted as a potential risk in a 2002 Swedish study.<br>
In 2015, the European Food Standard Agency (EFSA) published its first full risk assessment of acrylamide in food, which found that the chemical potentially increases the risk of cancer for all age groups.<br>
The FSA explain: "This means that acrylamide might contribute to your lifetime risk of developing cancer, although it is not possible to estimate how big this contribution may be.<br>
Eating too much processed and red meat, and cooking meat at high temperatures on grills and BBQs, could also increase your cancer risk.<br>
"Coffee has been shown, over and over again, to be a healthy beverage, " said William Murray, president and chief executive of the National Coffee Association, in reaction to the decision.<br>
A previous case resulted in potato-chip makers agreeing in 2008 to pay $3 million and remove acrylamide from their products.<br>
The chip-makers opted to do that rather than post cancer warnings like those that are found, and largely ignored, throughout California.<br>
He argued the lawsuit "does nothing to improve public health.".<br>
Kathryn M. Wilson, a cancer epidemiologist at Harvard University, told the LA Times: "I think the evidence that acrylamide makes a difference for human cancer risk is pretty weak.".<br>
31/3/2018 LOS ANGELES.<br>
A Los Angeles judge determined that coffee companies must carry a cancer warning label, because of a chemical produced in the roasting process.<br>
The judge said Wednesday that Starbucks and other companies failed to show that benefits from drinking coffee outweighed any risks.<br>
He ruled in an earlier phase of trial that companies had not shown the threat from the chemical was insignificant.<br>
The Council for Education and Research on Toxics, a nonprofit group, sued Starbucks and 90 other companies under a state law that requires warnings on a wide range of chemicals that can cause cancer, including acrylamide, a carcinogen present in coffee.<br>

Bleaching powder is usually a mixture of calcium chlorate (I) [basic calcium chloride, calcium hypochlorite], calcium chloride and calcium hydroxide prepared by passing chlorine gas through a calcium hydroxide solution.<br>
Calcium chlorate (I) oxidizes ethanol to ethyl aldehyde.<br>
Aldehydes or ketones have a hydrogen atom attached to the carbon atom attached to the carbonyl group, C=O.<br>
This hydrogen atom can be replaced by a halogen atom to form halogen compounds.<br>
If a molecule contains three such hydrogen atoms, e.g. ethanol and propanone (acetone) molecule, a trihalide may be formed, e.g. trichloromethane (chloroform, CCl3).<br>
H3C-C(O)-R + 3OX --> X3C-C(O)-R.<br>

Ethanol, ACS reagent, 99.5% (200 proof), absolute, ethyl alcohol, CH3CH2OH, C2H5OH, clear, colourless, mobile liquid, volatile organic compound, inflammable.<br>
It has a pleasant odour, burning taste, miscible with water and most organic solvents, rectified spirit, grain alcohol, spirit of wine.<br>
Constant boiling mixture = 95.6% ethanol and 4.4% water, BP. -78.3<sup>o</sup>C, absolute alcohol = 100% ethanol.<br>
RD 0.79 gm cm<sup>-3</sup>, BP. 78.5<sup>o</sup>C, absorbs moisture from air.<br>
Ethyl alcohol becomes very viscous at liquid nitrogen temperatures.<br>
This is known as 'foetal alcohol syndrome'.<br>
Consumption of ethanol during pregnancy may affect the unborn child, resulting in abortion, developmental problems, or birth defects, "foetal alcohol syndrome".<br>
Chronic ingestion of ethanol may cause liver cirrhosis and affect the nervous system.<br>

Methylated spirits (95% CH3CH2OH, 5% CH3OH), or absolute ethanol is usually denaturated with 4.8% methanol.<br>
However, thet composition is legally different in different countries, e.g. Australia 2% methanol.<br>
Methylated spirits, methylated ethanol, "spirits", "metho".<br>
Methylated spirits is sold retail in Australia as 95% ethanol, UN 1170, duplicator fluid / duplicator spirit, Fordigraph spirit duplicator fluid<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.2.9.9H">16.2.9.9</a> Denatured alcohol<br>
Additional substances are used to "denature" the ethanol so it cannot be consumed
However, it may be consumed by Aboriginal people in Australia by mixing methylated spirits with condensed milk.<br>
The sugar derivative, sucrose octoacetate, in Thaumatin, from the West African plant Ketemfe (Thaumatococcus danielli), E 957, relative sweetness 750 to 1 600<br>
It is bitter to raste and is used as a harmless denaturant for alcohol to make denatured spirit undrinkable.<br>
Previously, denatured spirit contained methanol to make it undrinkable, but it caused blindness in alcoholics determined to drink it.<br>
Use of methanol in home-made alcoholic beverages is illegal, because it may cause blindness.<br>
Spirit vini meth (90% ethanol + 5% v/v methanol+ 5% water)<br>
Denatured alcohol, denatured spirits (+ 2% of methyl alcohol, pyridine + other coal tar unpalatable chemicals).<br>
(in UK ethanol + 9.5% methanol + 0.5% pyridine + blue dye), (190-proof ethanol + 4% methanol + 1% other denaturants), (99% methylated spirits +1% bitrex)<br>
Consumption of methylated spirits<br>
Do not consume methylated spirits.
If methylated spirits is swallowed, do NOT induce vomiting, because it may enter the lungs.<br>
Flammability of methylated spirits<br>
Methylated spirit is highly flammable and must not be used near naked flames.<br>
It must be boiled in a beaker or set on wire gauze over a Bunsen burner to extract chlorophyll from leaves.<br>
Do not heat methylated spirit over a Bunsen burner, even in a closed container such as a flask with a reflux condenser, because the flask may crack.<br>
Methylated spirit burns with a nearly colourless flame, so if there is a fire, be careful of the invisible flames.<br>
Use a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher and fire blankets to smother the flames.<br>
Heating methylated spirits<br>
Use a water bath to heat methylated spirit in a flask, so if the flask cracks, a mixture of water and methylated spirit is less flammable than pure methylated spirit.<br>
Handling methylated spirits<br>
Repeated contact of the skin with methylated spirit can cause dermatitis, so wear rubber gloves if using methylated spirit as a solvent for cleaning.<br>
Mixing methylated spirits<br>
Do not mix methylated spirit with an oxidizing acid, e.g. concentrated nitric acid, because a vigorous reaction or explosion may occur.<br>
Uses of methylated spirits<br>
Use methylated spirit as a cheap low toxicity cleaning solvent for solvent extraction.<br>
Observe the rapid changes in colour during the dissolution of plant pigments in methylated spirits.<br>
