 Copper wire connecting is PVC-covered<br>
 Copper is a metallic element used for coin alloys, electrical wiring, heating vessels, jewellery, roofing material, conducting electricity and lightning conductors.<br>
 Copper, Cu (cuprum) is a bright red-orange, ductile, malleable and ductile transition metal, with high electrical and thermal conductivity.<br>
 Copper deficiency may occur in infants fed only on cow's milk.<br>
 Copper bracelets may alleviate, but not cure, arthritis.<br>
 Copper bowls may be preferable for beating cream.<br>
 Copper poisoning may occur from water standing for a long time in copper pipes or copper hot water service.<br>
 It becomes dull when exposed to air, and in moist air becomes coated with verdis blue or green, basic copper carbonate.<br>
 It can be attacked by mineral acids, e.g. hydrochloric and sulfuric acids and organic acids, e.g. acetic acid.<br>
 It competes with zinc for entry from the intestines, so an increase in dietary zinc may result in copper deficiency.<br>
 It has reaction with dilute HCl or H2SO4 or with water.<br>
 It is a cofactor for many enzymes and proteins, and is used in the development of nerve, bone, blood and connective tissue.<br>
 It is an excellent conductor of heat.<br>
 It is extracted from cuprite Cu2S, and malachite (basic copper (II) carbonate, Cu2CO3(OH)2.<br>
 It is available as ingots, filings, foil, powder, turnings, nails, wire, turnings.<br>
 It is soluble in dilute ammonia.<br>
 It is incompatible with alkali solutions, sodium azide and acetylene.<br>
 It is the only red or red-brown metal.<br>
 It reacts with concentrated oxidizing acids, HNO3 or H2SO4 to produce high oxidation number ions, and sulfur dioxide SO2 or nitrogen dioxide, NO2.<br>
 It reacts with strong oxidants, e.g. chlorates, bromates and iodates, to cause an explosion hazard.<br>
 Most Cu + compounds are white, but copper (I) oxide is brick red.<br>
 The heated powder forms an oxide.<br>
 The recommended daily allowance, RDA, is 1.5 to 3.0 mg.<br>

 At pH below 7.0, the toxicity of copper is greatly enhanced.<br> 
 Prepare solutions of desired pH by diluting some 0.1 M hydrochloric acid (pH 1).<br> 
 Add standard copper solution to produce a 1 ppm concentration of copper.<br> 
3. Effect of other metals on the toxicity of a copper algicide<br>
 Toxicity of ionic copper on algal growth is reduced by trivalent (3+) 
metal ions, including those of Mn, Co, Al, Fe and Cr.<br> 
 They form a layer of metal (III) hydroxide around the algal cell, adsorb copper and reduce the penetration of copper into the cell.<br> 
 The degree of insolubility of the metal (III) hydroxide is related to its ability to protect against copper toxicity.<br> 
 Test different metals while keeping the Cu 2+ concentration the same.<br> 
4. Effect of availability of copper on the toxicity of a copper algicide<br>
 The two types of algicides sold are 1. ionic copper, a 5% CuSO4 solution (5 g copper (II) sulfate / 100 mL) and 2. chelated copper (about 7% Cu).<br> 
 Chelated copper such as copper alkanolamine complex is more toxic to algae than ionic copper, because both the metal and the organic ligand enter the algae cell.<br> 
 Also, chelated copper is more resistant to changes in pH.<br> 
 Test the algicide ability of both forms of algicide at the same concentration of Cu 2+ , and compare them at different pH.<br> 
 Chelated copper remains active algicide for several weeks whereas copper (II) sulfate remains active only for a few days.<br> 
 If pool water contains a high concentration of carbonate ions, so the copper ions in copper (II) sulfate will react quickly with the carbonate ions and form an insoluble precipitate of copper carbonate.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.7.11.5H">12.7.11.5</a> Prepare copper from copper sulfate<br>
1. Shake iron filings with 2 cm of blue vitriol solution in a test-tube for a few minutes.<br>
The colour of the solution will fade, and, if the shaking is continued long enough, will disappear.<br>
Filter the contents of the tube.<br>
Note the red-brown powder left in the filter paper.<br>
copper sulfate + iron --> copper + iron sulfate<br>
The red-brown powder is not pure copper, because excess of iron filings have been used, so it is a mixture of copper and excess iron filings coated with copper.<br>
2. Repeat the experiment using a piece of lead instead of iron filings.<br>
After cleaning the lead rub it with sandpaper and then immerse it in hot copper sulfate solution.<br>
The heat is necessary, because the action is slow in the cold.<br>
A film of copper will be deposited on the lead.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.7.11.7H">12.7.11.7</a> Prepare copper (I) oxide with golden syrup<br>
1. Add sodium hydroxide solution to 2 cm of copper (II) sulfate solution.<br>
A blue jelly-like precipitate of copper hydroxide forms.<br>
Stir golden syrup on the end of a spoon into a little hot water until it has dissolved.<br>
Add 2 cm of this solution to the copper hydroxide precipitate in the test-tube.<br>
Heat the test-tube gently.<br>
A yellow precipitate of copper (I) oxide, CuO, forms in the test-tube.<br>
The colour gradually changes to orange.<br>
Filter off the precipitate.<br>
The copper (I) oxide is left in the filter paper turns red, its usual colour.<br>
2. Repeat the experiment with a solution of black treacle, or the sweet sold as "barley sugar".<br>
These foods contain glucose.<br>
This chemical action may be used as a test for glucose.<br>
3. Use the solution to test on a cut apple for glucose.<br>
Heat small pieces of the apple with water.<br>
After filtering the liquid, use it in the same way as described for the golden syrup solution above.<br>
2NaOH (aq) + CuSO4 (aq) --> Na2SO4 (aq) + Cu(OH)2 (s).<br>

Copper (II) sulfate with ammonium chloride<br>
Add 1 mL of powdered copper (II) sulfate and 1 mL of ammonium chloride to a test-tube nearly full of water.<br>
Dissolve the substances by holding the thumb over the end of the test-tube and shake the test-tube upside.<br>
Use a small paint brush to write on a piece of paper with the faint blue solution.<br>
When the writing has dried, it is invisible.<br>
Warm the paper in front of a flame to make the writing appear in yellow letters.<br>
CuSO4.5H2O + 2NH4Cl --> (NH4)2SO4 + CuCl2 + 5H2O<br>
Copper (II) chloride solution is green-blue.<br>

Make a strong solution of copper sulfate by heating 1 cm of the powder with 2 cm of water in a test-tube.<br>
When the powder has dissolved, cool the test-tube under the tap.<br>
Pour drops of methylated spirits into the test-tube.<br>
A shower of very small crystals of copper sulfate precipitates in the test-tube, because copper sulfate is insoluble in methylated spirit.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.15.3.1H">12.15.3.1</a> Prepare iron sulfate with copper (II) sulfate solution<br>
1. Shake 2 mL of iron filings with 4 cm of copper sulfate solution in a test-tube for a few minutes.<br>
The colour of the solution will fade.<br>
If the shaking continued for long enough the colour disappears.<br>
Filter the contents of the test-tube.<br>
A red-brown powder is left in the filter paper as the more reactive Fe, displaces Cu to form FeSO4 and Cu.<br>
Fe (s) + CuSO4 (aq) --> FeSO4 (aq) + Cu (s)<br>
iron + copper sulfate --> iron (II) sulfate + copper<br>
The red-brown powder is not pure copper, because as excess iron filings are used in the experiment it is a mixture of copper and excess iron filings coated with copper.<br>

Zinc metal can displace copper ions from a solution of copper (II) sulfate.<br>
Add excess zinc powder to copper (II) sulfate solution.<br>

A film of copper deposits on the lead.<br>
Pb (s) + Cu 2+ (aq) + SO4 2- (aq) --> Pb 2+ (aq) + SO4 2- (aq) + Cu (s)<br>
Pb 2+ (aq) + SO4 2- (aq) --> PbSO4 (s)<br>
However, the lead sulfate is insoluble in the solution and rapidly forms a layer on the lead strip.<br>
So most people think no reaction occurs.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.15.4H">12.15.4</a> Prepare copper (II) carbonate and copper (II) oxide<br>
Add 2 cm of copper sulfate solution to 2 cm of sodium carbonate solution.<br>
A blue-green precipitate of copper carbonate forms in the double decomposition reaction<br>
Filter the precipitate, and with a spill transfer it to a metal lid.
Hold the lid in a pair of pliers and warm it gently over a small flame.<br>
The green colour copper (II) carbonate will change to black, because of formation of black copper (II) oxide.<br>
2Na + + SO4 2- + Cu 2+ + CO3 2 - --> Na2SO4 + CuCO3<br>
Na2CO3 + CuSO4 --> Na2SO4 + CuCO3<br>
sodium carbonate + copper sulfate --> sodium sulfate + copper (II) carbonate<br>
Another explanation:<br>
2Na2CO3 +2CuSO4 + H2O --> 2Na2SO4 + Cu2(OH)2CO3 + CO2<br>
sodium carbonate + copper sulfate + water --> sodium sulfate + basic copper carbonate + carbon dioxide<br>
Cu2(OH)2CO3 = 2CuO + CO2+ H2O.<br>

 The green surface is called a patina.<br>
 It also forms on old unpolished bronze.<br>
 1. Heat a narrow strip of copper foil, for half a minute, using the test-tube holder, so that only a small part of the foil is in the flame.<br>
 Describe what happens to the metal.<br>
 The metal does not melt.<br>

4. Show that something is added to the copper from the air.<br>
 Use a sensitive balance to weigh the copper before and after heating.<br>
5. Use two identical hard glass test-tubes with one-hole stoppers fitted with bent delivery tubes.<br>
 Fix both test-tubes to a stand so that the test-tubes slope down with the ends of the delivery tubes under water in a beaker.<br>
 Put copper foil in the first test-tube and heat with a hot burner flame.<br>
 After two minutes, heat the empty second test-tube.<br>
 Move the burner regularly between the two test-tubes until no more bubbles come out of the ends of the delivery tubes.<br>
 Stop heating both test-tubes.<br>
 As the test-tubes cool, they suck water up the delivery tube.<br>
 The test-tube containing the copper (II) oxide sucks up more water.<br>
