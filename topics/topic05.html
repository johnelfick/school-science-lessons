<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.1.1H">5.1.1</a> Alloys<br>
 1. Alloys (Latin: alligere, bind together)<br>
 Alloys have metallic properties and are composed of two or more elements.<br>
 Alloys can be compounds, solid solutions, e.g. gold copper alloys and alum crystals, or just mixtures of the components.<br>
 Alloys are used for coins, type metal, heating elements, construction, machinery, e.g. brass taps, bronze coins or ship propellers, duralumin aircraft parts, stainless steel knives.<br>
 Light metal alloys, e.g. duralumin, 94.5% aluminium, 4% copper, 1% manganese, 0.5% magnesium have strength and lightness for construction of aircraft and racing cars.<br>
 Coins and jewellery are made of a precious metal mixed with another metal to make them harder and not wear easily.<br>
 Iron alloys are tougher than pure iron so are used to make machines, e.g. stainless steel is made from iron chromium nickel alloys.<br>
 Magnetic alloys, e.g. "Alnico" (iron, aluminium, nickel and cobalt), are used to make permanent magnets for refrigerator doors and radio speakers.<br>
 However, electromagnets must be turned on or off so a different iron nickel alloy is used.<br>
 One piece of alloy metal may contain several solid phases, because of the limited solubility of one metal in another.<br>
 Metals may be suddenly cooled, quenched, to prevent phase equilibrium being established.<br>
 2. Alloys are a compound, solution or mixture of two or more metals.<br>
 A few alloys contain a non-metal, e.g. steel.<br>
 The first known alloy was bronze, a mixture of copper and tin, used to make utensils and swords, spears and shields about 6000 years ago.<br>
 Later came brass, copper and zinc, steel, iron and carbon and many other alloys.<br>
 Usually, alloys have characteristics different from the component metals.<br>
 For example they usually melt at lower temperature and are harder than the constituent metals.<br>
 The fusion of metals to form alloys is often done under a flux that may promote liquefaction, prevent volatilization and unnecessary exposure to the air.<br>
 Example of a useful alloy<br>
 Babbitt's metal, alloy for bearings (Sn 5-90%, Sb 7-10%, Cu 1.5-6%, Pb 5-48%)<br>
 Make a collection of alloys found in the home, school laboratory and workshop.<br>
Alloys<br>
<a name="GermansilverH"></a> German silver, silvery-looking cheap alloy of copper, zinc and nickel</a><br>
<a name="ManganinH"></a> Manganin, resistance alloy, 86% Cu, 12% Mn, 2% Ni, for low temperatures, almost zero temperature coefficient of resistance<br>
<a name="MischmetalH"></a> Misch metal, mixed metal alloy, Ce, La, Nd, cigarette lighter flint, deoxidizer<br>
<a name="PinchbeckH"></a> Pinchbeck, cheap alloy resembling gold, 83.6% copper, 16.4% zinc<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.1.2H">5.1.2</a> Carat<br>
Pure gold is rated at 24 carats, so 18 carat gold contains six parts of an alloy.<br>
Gold leaf, 23-24 carat, is gold beaten into very thin sheets for gilding decoration and electrical contacts, e.g. gold leaf electroscope.<br>
The concentration of gold in sea water is about 10-30 g / km2, but no profitable method of extraction is known.<br>
The red-purple alloy guanin, prized by pre-Columbian Indians in the Cuba region, was an alloy of gold, silver and copper.<br>
Note the colour, and density of the specimen.<br>
For gold, a carat is a ratio of 1 / 24.<br>
Purity of gold is measured in carats, (ct).<br>
24 carat gold is pure gold.<br>
22 carat gold is 22 parts pure gold and 2 parts copper or other metal alloy.<br>
18 carat gold is 18 parts of gold in 24 parts of alloy, usually copper.<br>
14 carat gold is 14 parts pure gold and 14 parts copper or other metal.<br>
The official mark stamped on gold and silver objects after being assayed is the hall mark (from Goldsmith's Hall, London).<br>
For gold, the standard mark is a crown in England for 22 and 18 carat gold followed by the number of carats in figures.<br>
Lower standards of gold have the number of carats in figures without the crown.<br>
The term "carat" is said to come from Arabic quirat and Greek keration, the seed of the carob tree, Ceratonia siliqua.<br>
<a href="../images/Carob.jpg">See diagram</a>: Carob tree.<br>
<a href="https://www.daleysfruit.com.au/buy/carob-tree.htm">Carob Tree</a>, Daley's Fruit Trees.<br>
This seed was used to weigh gold, at 0.18 g per seed, regardless of the shape of the seed.<br>
Although this assumption was found to be inaccurate, for a long time, the carob seed remained the only known way to weigh gold.<br>
 The Australian uncirculated $100 coin is 91.67% gold, 4.17% silver and 4.17% copper<br>
 Sterling silver is an alloy of 92.5% silver and 7.5% copper.<br>
 For precious stones, 1 carat is about 1 / 142 of an ounce, formerly 3.17 grains, but now standardised at 0.20 g.<br>
 In 1907, the Fourth General Conference on Weights and Measures decided that one diamond carat = 200 mg, 0.2 g, of a diamond.<br>
 So for diamonds, the term "carat" is used to mean 0.2 grams.<br>
 Diamonds with high carat weights are cut from larger rough crystals.<br>
 Also, diamond carats are measured in "points", where 100 points = 1 carat.<br>
 Diamonds are not alloys, but pure carbon.<br> 

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.1.3H">5.1.3</a> Amalgams<br>
 Amalgams are alloys of mercury with most other metals.<br>
 Silver / mercury amalgams were commonly used in dentistry, but nowadays are replaced by hard plastic.<br>
 Previously, the backs of mirrors and glass balls were coated with 30 parts mercury / 70 parts tin amalgams.<br>
 All amalgams are decomposed by heat into mercury vapour and the metal residue.<br>
 Copper amalgam, Viennese metal, was used for cementing metals.<br>
 Zinc amalgam was used in electric batteries.<br>
 Gold amalgams were used for gilding.<br>
 Lead amalgams were used to solder metals.<br>
 Nowadays, amalgams are seldom used for fear of mercury poisoning when the amalgams decompose.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.1.4H">5.1.4</a> Case-hardening<br>
Case-hardening produces a hard surface layer in steel, either by heating in a carbon rich medium followed by quenching and tempering, or by rapidly heating the surface of a high carbon steel above the ferrite / austenite transformation temperature, 50 oC, followed by quenching and tempering.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.1.5H">5.1.5</a> Cast iron<br>
The alloy cast iron contains some additional combination of Ni, Cr, Cu, Mo, to obtain the high temperature form austenite or the low temperature ferritic form.<br>
If the austenite is cooled very quickly by quenching, it forms the very hard martensite steel.<br>
Tempering between 220 oC and 450 oC oxidizes the carbon in the steel to soften it and make it more ductile.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.1.6H">5.1.6</a> Copper-aluminium alloys, bronze<br>
 The aluminium-copper alloys usually contain 2 to 10% copper.<br>
 The copper provides substantial increases in strength and facilitates precipitation hardening.<br>
 Copper can also reduce ductility and corrosion resistance of aluminium.<br>
 However, these alloys can be the most difficult aluminium alloys to weld, because of their susceptibility to solidification cracking.<br>
 These alloys are some of the highest strength heat treatable aluminium alloys.<br>
 The most common applications are aerospace, military vehicles and rocket fins.<br>
 The 10% aluminium alloy, aluminium bronze (looks like 18 carat gold!).<br>
 Cu Al Ni alloys used in Australian $1 and $2 coins and in English one pound and two pound coins.<br>
 The Australian one dollar "kangaroos" coin is 92% copper, 6% aluminium, 2% nickel.<br>
 The United Kingdom one pound coin is 70% copper, 24.5% zinc, 5.5% nickel.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.1.7H">5.1.7</a> Copper-chromium alloys<br>
 Chromium copper alloys containing 0.6 to 1.2% Cr are used for their high strength, corrosion resistance and electrical conductivity.<br>
 They are "age-hardenable", i.e. a change in properties occurs at high temperature due to the precipitation of chromium out of the solid solution.<br>
 The strength of fully-aged chromium copper is nearly twice that of pure copper and its conductivity remains high at 85% IACS i.e. 85% of pure copper.<br>
 These high streproduce ngth alloys retain their strength at elevated temperatures.<br>
 The corrosion resistance of chromium copper alloys is better than that of pure copper, because chromium improves the chemical properties of the protective oxide film.<br>
 A time capsule made of specially-created "cupaloy" alloy made of 99.4% copper, 0.5% chromium, and 0.1% silver to last for 5000 years.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.1.8H">5.1.8</a> Copper-nickel alloys<br>
 The addition of nickel to copper improves strength and corrosion resistance, but good ductility is retained.<br>
 Copper-nickel alloys have excellent resistance to marine corrosion and biofouling.<br>
 The two main alloys are 90/10 and 70/30.<br>
 The 70/30 is stronger and has greater resistance to sea water flow.<br>
 However, but the 90/10 will provide good service for most applications and, being less expensive, tends to be more widely used.<br>
 Both alloys contain small, but important additions of iron and manganese for the best combination of resistance to flowing sea water and to overall corrosion.<br>
 Copper-nickel alloys are used for marine applications due to their excellent resistance to seawater corrosion, resistance to biofouling and easy to fabric.<br>
 They have provided reliable service for several decades while offering effective solutions to today's technological challenges.<br>
 As copper nickel sheathing it releases copper, and loses weight, to protect against barnacle growth on ships,
 The 70% copper + 30% nickel is used as base for silver-plated middle value coins.<br>
German silver, nickel silver, is silver-white alloy of copper, zinc and nickel, but it contains no silver.<br>
It is very hard, resistant to corrosion, ersistant to electricity, and does not tarnish, because no silver content.<br>
 Monel (TM), alloys composed mostly of nickel and copper, with some iron, manganese, carbon, and silicon, have strong corrosion resistance.<br>
 All Australian coins are made from an alloy of 75% copper and 25% nickel.<br>
 The United States "nickel" (0.05 US dollars), is 75% copper, 25% nickel.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.1.9H">5.1.9</a> Copper-tin alloys, bronze<br>
 Copper- tin alloys, tin bronzes, have corrosion resistance.<br>
 Tin bronzes are stronger and more ductile than red and semi-red brasses.<br>
 They have high wear resistance and low friction coefficient against steel.<br>
 The room temperature phase transformations are slow and usually do not occur, therefore these alloys are single phase alloys.<br>
 The tin bronzes are used in bearings, gears, piston rings, valves, fittings, coins, bells.<br>
 1. 10% Sn, carrots bronze<br>
 2. Phosphorus added to give stronger phosphor bronze.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.1.10H">5.1.10</a> Copper-zinc alloys, brass<br>
 1. 5% Zn alloy, gilding metal, used for cheap jewellery, low value coins<br>
 2. 10% Zn, brass as sold by chemical suppliers<br>
 3. 15% Zn, red brass<br>
 4. 30% Zn, used for cartridge and shell cases<br>
 5. 2% Zn + 88% Cu + 10% Sn, admiralty gun metal, was used for guns.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.1.11H">5.1.11</a> Copper, brass and bronze alloys<br>
 Formerly, brass was any alloy of copper with tin or zinc and even other metals, but nowadays brass is only the yellow alloy of copper and zinc.<br>
 Bronze is a brown alloy of copper with up to 30% tin and other metals.<br>
 The hardness and workability of brass make it a valuable manufacturing material.<br>
 Alpha brasses have &lt; 40% zinc, are malleable and can be worked cold.<br>
 Beta brasses have &gt; 40% zinc, must be worked hot, but are harder and stronger.<br>
 Since the Bronze Age, brass was made by melting copper with calamine, basic zinc carbonate, ZnCO3.2ZnO.3H2O.<br>
 In the King James version of the Bible, 2 Chronicles, Chapter 4, Verse 16: 16: "The pots also, and the shovels, and the flesh hooks and all their instruments, did Huram his father make to king 
 Solomon<br>for the house of the LORD of bright brass."<br>
 Yellow brass may be 70% copper and 30% zinc.<br>
Experiment<br>
Add dilute nitric acid to brass, pure copper and iron filings and compare the reactions.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.1.12H">5.1.12</a> Eutectic and dystectic mixtures<br>
 1. A eutectic mixture is a mixture of two substances that melts and freezes at a temperature lower than the melting points of the constituents or of any other mixture of them.<br>
 A dystectic mixture is a mixture of two substances at the composition yielding the highest melting point.<br>
 The melting point of the alloy is lower than the melting points of any of the metals it contains.<br>
 The eutectic temperature is the lowest temperature at which both solid components of a mixture are in equilibrium with the liquid phase.<br>
2. Eutectic temperature and percentage composition by weight<br>
 183 oC: Sn 63.0% Pb 37.0%<br>
 198 oC: Sn 91.0% Zn 9.0%<br>
 221 oC: Sn 96.5% Ag 3.5%<br>
 227 oC: Sn 99.2% Cu 0.8%.<br>
3. When the temperature of a mixture of 63.0% tin and 37.0% lead cools to 183 oC, the liquid mixture freezes sharply.<br>
 So above 183 oC the mixture is liquid and below 183 oC the mixture is solid.<br>
 An eutectic mixture has a sharp melting point as if it were a pure substance.<br>
 This mixture (electricians' solder), has a comparatively low melting point, conducts electricity, "wets" copper wire and sets very quickly, so components are not overheated.<br>
 When the temperature of mixture of 30% tin and 70% lead (plumbers' solder), cools to 250 oC, the liquid mixture starts to solidify, but it does not freeze sharply.<br>
 It finally solidifies at 183 oC, giving the plumber time to ensure a good setting of a joint.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.1.13H">5.1.13</a> Higher MP alloys<br>
 Use a burner for solder (MP 250 oC), but use a furnace for the others.<br>
Experiment<br>
 Melt the copper first then add the other metals.<br>
 Brass alloys are very resistant to corrosion so are commonly used for taps.<br>
 Bronzes are very hard and are used for bearings.<br>
 There are many specialist bronzes, e.g. phosphor bronze, aluminium bronze, gunmetal for gears.<br>
 Copper alloys have a special designation, e.g. | CZ, copper zinc | PB, phosphor bronze | CT, copper tin |, CN copper nickel | LG leaded gunmetal |.<br>
 Bell metal for casting bells, is a CT alloy in ration 4:1, + small amounts of othe metals

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.1.14H">5.1.14</a> Lower melting point alloys<br>
These alloys have a melting point lower than any of the constituent metals, e.g. Wood's metal, has melting point 80 oC, but the lowest melting point of the constituents, tin, has melting point 232 oC.<br>
A sprinkler stop valve fire control system may have a metal plug in the fire sprinkler bulb made of a bismuth alloy that melts at 155 oC to open the sprinkler and put out the fire.<br>
Similarly, electrical fuse wire in a circuit melts when heated to a certain temperature when excessive electric current flows through it.<br>
Common solder remains in a semi-melted state at around 200 oC, so it can be managed easily.<br>
For alloys containing bismuth and lead, first melt them together, then add the other ingredients.<br>
The temperature should not be higher than necessary to prevent excess oxidation.<br>
Lower melting point alloys with the parts shown are by weight:<br>
Electrical fuse: 8.5 Pb, 2.5 Sn, 1.3 Bi, 0 Cd<br>
Wood's metal: 4 Pb, 2 Sn, 7 Bi, 1 Cd<br>
Lower melting alloys may be produced by using a Bunsen burner.<br>
The higher melting alloys. e.g. bronze and brass, are produced in a furnace with the copper melted first and the other metals added.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.1.15H">5.1.15</a> Nitinol memory wire<br>
 Nitinol Memory Wire, solid state chemistry, Ni Ti alloys<br>
 This crystalline metal changes phase at about 50 oC.<br>
 Bend it, then drop it into hot water and it returns to its original shape.<br>
 The wire can be set into different shapes by heating with a candle flame.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.1.17H">5.1.17</a> Stainless steel<br>
Stainless steel contains 12-5% Cr to produce the stainless chromium oxide film on the surface to prevent corrosion.<br>
So stainless steel must be kept clean to maximum availability of oxygen to the chromium atoms.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.1.18H">5.1.18</a> Steel<br>
Plain carbon steel contains up to 2% carbon and up 0.8% manganese, 0.3% silicon and 0.5% sulfur and phosphorus.<br><br>
Low alloy steels contain in addition up to 5% Mn, Ni, Cr, Va, Mo.<br><br>

Tends to be “sticky” in machining.<br>
This grade has high strength with reasonable ductility & weldability.<br> 
The greatest usage of steel is in hard chrome-plated bar for hydraulic & pneumatic rams: e.g. Hard-chromed bar.<br>
It is widely used free machining steel with reasonable ductility & weldability.<br> 
It is used for shafts, which require considerable machining, and concrete case hardened ferrules, (circular rings or sleeves for fastening and joining).<br>
Premium grade free-cutting steel is used by repetition engineers for a wide variety of applications.<br> 
Excellent machinability & suitable for case hardening & electroplating.<br>
Highest strength free machining steel.<br> 
It is used when other free machining steels have insufficient strength, e.g. tow balls (for joining to a trailer and allowing swiveling and articulation, automotive clutch boss, (motor clutch housing).<br> 

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.1.19H">5.1.19</a> Wrought iron<br>
Nowadays, wrought iron is used to produce decorative staircases, balustrading, fencing, gates, security doors, window grilles, and furniture.<br>
Wrought iron is a tough malleable form of iron, used for forging or rolling rather than casting.<br>
It is made by puddling (stirring) pig iron while it is still molten.<br>
It is nearly pure, but contains some filaments of slag.<br>
Pure iron can be made by hammering to form wrought iron, with &lt; 0.25% carbon:<br>
 Fe3C + FeO --> 4Fe + CO (g).<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.2.1H">5.2.1</a> Concentrations and volumes<br>
 Concentration is the quantity of dissolved substance, solute, per unit quantity of solvent in a solution.<br>
Or, concentration is the number of ions or molecules of a substance, in a given volume of solvent.<br>
 Concentration, c (formerly molarity), is expressed as moles per litre, mol l-1, mol dm-3<br>
 Concentration can also be expressed as moles per cubic metre or moles per cubic decimetre<br>
 1 litre = 1 cubic decimetre (1 dm3) = 1000 cubic centimetres (1000 cm3).<br>
* Mass concentration is the mass of a constituent divided by the volume of the mixture.<br>
Mass concentration, ρρ = g cm-3, kg l-1, kg dm-3<br>
Mass concentration = mass / volume.<br>
SI unit kg/m3 = to g/L.<br>
w/v (g/mL) weight in grams of solute/milliliters of solute.<br>
w/w weight in grams of solute/weight in grams of solution (g/g).<br>
* Molar concentration is the amount of a constituent in moles divided by the volume of the mixture.<br>
Molar concentration = number of moles / volume.<br>

 Equal numbers of gas molecules occupy equal volumes.<br>
 So the molar volumes of all gases are the same at the same

 A molar solution, 1 M, contains 1 mole of solute per litre of solution.<br>
 1 M = 1 gram molecular weight of solute / litre of solution, so a 1 M NaCl solution contains (23 + 35.5) = 58.5 g of NaCl in 1 litre of solution.<br>
 A 1 M hydrochloric acid solution contains (1 + 35.5) = 36.5 g / L.<br>
 2. Molarity is the concentration of the solution expressed as the number of moles of the dissolved substance per dm3 (litre) of solution.<br>
 A molar solution has a concentration of one mole per dm3 (litre).<br>
 3. 1 M (1 molar solution) = 1 mol / L = 1 mol / dm3 = 1 mol dm-3 = 1000 mol / m3<br>

 1 molal = moles per Kg water.<br>
 Molality is the concentration of a solution expressed as number of moles of the dissolved substance per kilogram of solvent.<br>
 The SI unit for molality is moles per kilogram of solvent, mol / kg.<br>

1. A normal solution contains 1 gram equivalent weight of solute per litre of solution.<br>

H2SO4 / litre.<br>
So molarity × valence = normality.<br>
A 2 mol per litre solution of sulfuric acid, 2M, is a 4 N solution.<br>
The term "normal solution" is obsolescent and is no longer used or taught in chemistry teaching, but it is still being used in the chemical industry and medicine.<br>
2. Normality was a concentration unit formerly used for acid, bases, oxidizing agents and reducing agents, based on the concentration 
 of H+ and OH- in a solution.<br>
A normal solution has a concentration of one gram equivalent per dm3 (litre).<br>
One litre of a normal solution contains the weight in grams of the solute that is equivalent to 1 g of replaceable hydrogen gas.<br>
So 25 mL of N HCl would react exactly with 25 mL of N NaOH or 250 mL of N / 10 NaOH.<br>
For monobasic acids, the equivalent is numerically the same as the molecular weight.<br>
For dibasic acids, the equivalent is numerically equal to half the molecular weight.<br>

 So dissolve (4 / 2)M × 80 g = 160 g sodium hydroxide in 1 litre of water to make a 4 M solution.<br>
 2. If a solution less concentrated than in preparation instructions is needed, dissolve less solute in one litre of water.<br>
 For a 0.01 M sodium iodide solution, Table 5.4.1.0 shows that 15 g of sodium iodide is needed to make 1 litre of 0.1 M solution.<br>
 So dissolve (0.01 / 0.1) M × 15 g = 1.5 g sodium iodide in 1 litre of water to make a 0.1 M solution.<br>
3. A stock bottle or "Winchester" bottle may have a volume of 2.4 litres.<br>
To make 2.4 litres of 2 M Sulfuric, 55 mL of conc. acid is needed to make 1 litre of 1 M solution.<br>

 2. Pour 25 mL of 2 M hydrochloric acid into a 50 cm2 burette.<br>
 Very carefully pour 25 mL of water on top of the hydrochloric acid, leaving a space between the liquid and the top of the burette.<br>
 The two solutions should not mix much.<br>
 3. Push the length of magnesium ribbon by the middle to be just inside into the open end of the burette.<br>
 Curl the magnesium ribbon around so that it stays in place like a spring under tension.<br>
 4. Pour water into a beaker, close the top opening of the burette with your finger and quickly invert the burette so that the lower end is under the water<br>
 5. Clamp the burette to a burette stand and quickly note the 
 inverted burette reading on the scale before the magnesium starts reacting with the acid.<br>
 The liquid level in the burette must start on the graduated scale.<br>
 If it is not on the scale turn the tap on and off quickly to let the level drop to be on the scale.<br>
 6. When all the magnesium has reacted with the downwards diffusing acid and no more gas bubble form, because all the magnesium has reacted, note the inverted burette reading again.<br>
 Calculate the difference in burette readings, about 30.5 cm3.<br>

 So 1 mole of magnesium produces 1 mole of hydrogen molecules, i.e. 24.4 litres = 24, 400 cm3 of hydrogen gas.<br>
 If 0.03 g of magnesium produces 30.5 cm3 of hydrogen gas, the mass of magnesium needed to produce 24, 400 cm3 of hydrogen gas = 24, 400 × 0.03 / 30.5

 So the relative atomic mass of magnesium is 24.8.<br>

 Solution refers to a homogeneous mixture of two or more components in the same phase, i.e. with no boundaries, with the atoms or molecules interspersed, e.g. salt water.<br>
 A mixture of gases can also be referred to as a solution.<br>
 However, the term solution commonly refers to an aqueous solution, a solute dissolved in the solvent water.<br>
 In this document the term solution refers to an aqueous solution unless otherwise indicated, e.g. ethanol solution.<br>

 A saturated solution contains the maximum amount of solute at that temperature.<br>
 In a saturated solution, the rate of loss of solute particles leaving the solution is equal to the rate of solute particles entering the solution, so the dissolved substance is in equilibrium with the undissolved substance.<br>
 As the maximum equilibrium concentration depends on temperature, a saturated solution can become an unstable supersaturated solution by slow cooling.<br>

 Record the weight of the weighing bottle + anhydrous sodium carbonate powder<br>
 If weight &gt; 6.63 g, add more anhydrous sodium carbonate powder until weight is just more than 6.63 g.<br>
 * Record mass of sodium carbonate powder =. g 
Tip out sodium carbonate powder into a beaker.<br>
 Record weight of the weighing bottle (+ remaining sodium carbonate powder).<br>
 * Record mass of any remaining sodium carbonate powder in weighing bottle = g.<br>
 Do not try to remove the last traces of sodium carbonate clinging to the weighing bottle.<br>
 Mass of sodium carbonate in beaker = g (1.1 - 2.1).<br>
 2. Prepare 250 mL of sodium carbonate solution from the powder in the beaker.<br>
 Add about 100 mL of distilled water or deionized water to the beaker.<br>
 Stir with a glass rod until all the powder has dissolved.<br>
 Pour the solution through a filter funnel into a 250 volumetric flask.<br>
 Rinse the beaker with distilled water from a plastic wash bottle.<br>
 Wash the glass rod and inside of the funnel.<br>
 Repeat steps the above procedure.<br>
 Add more distilled water from the plastic wash bottle to the volumetric flask, to about 2 cm below the graduation mark.<br>
 Add more distilled water from a dropper until the lower meniscus of the solution just rests on the graduation mark.<br>
 Put the stopper in the mouth of the flask.<br>
 Press the stopper into position and invert the flask several times to mix the contents well.<br>
 3. Calculate the molarity of the standard sodium carbonate solution prepared.<br>
 Mass of Na2CO3 used = x g<br>
 Molar mass of Na2CO3 = 106 g mol-1 (23.00 x 2 + 12.00 + 16.00 x 3).<br>
 Volume of sodium carbonate solution prepared = 250 mL.<br>
 Molarity of the standard sodium carbonate solution prepared = number of moles of Na2CO3 / volume of sodium carbonate solution = (x / 106) / 250 = M.<br>
 4. Prepare standard sodium carbonate solution by dilution<br>
Prepare a washed pipette.<br>
Use a pipette filler to suck water into a pipette to fill part of the bulb.<br>
Hold the pipette horizontally and rotate it slowly so that water washes the inner wall up to the graduation mark.<br>
Let the washing water to run out into the sink.<br>
Repeat the above procedure to prepare a washed pipette using the prepared sodium carbonate solution instead of water.<br>
Use the pipette filler and the washed pipette to transfer 25.0 mL of the prepared sodium carbonate solution into a clean 250 mL volumetric flask.<br>
Add distilled water from a plastic wash bottle into the volumetric flask, to a level about 2 cm below the graduation mark.<br>
Add distilled water from a dropper until the lower meniscus of the solution just rests on the graduation mark.<br>
Put the stopper in the volumetric flask.<br>
Press the stopper into position then invert the volumetric flask several times to mix the contents well.<br>
25.0 mL of the M sodium carbonate solution is diluted to a volume of 250 mL.<br>
So, the molarity of the diluted sodium carbonate solution = ( X ) M =.M<br>
Attach a label to the volumetric flask, e.g. Name, Class, Na2CO3 (aq), Molarity, Date, and store the volumetric flask in a safe place.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.4.7H">5.4.7</a> Prepare dilute acids<br>
Acids and alkalis are dangerous materials, especially when they are concentrated.<br>
 Keep nearby, calcium carbonate or sodium hydrogen carbonate or whiting (for acids), and solid citric acid (for alkalis).<br>
 Use safety glasses and nitrile chemical-resistant protective gloves when carrying out dilution of concentrated acids or alkalis, but be sure that the outside surfaces of gloves and bottles are dry to 
avoid<br>accidental slipping of bottles when handled.<br>
 Any acid or alkali that contacts the skin should be immediately washed off with copious quantities of water.<br>
 Then apply dilute sodium bicarbonate solution to the affected area (for acid burns), or very dilute ethanoic acid (acetic acid), or vinegar solution or boracic acid (for alkali burns), to neutralize traces of the acid or alkali.<br>
 Any spills of acids or alkalis should be diluted as above, before mopping up.<br>
 For large spills, solid neutralizers such as solid sodium bicarbonate or whiting (for acids), and solid citric acid (for alkalis), should be used.<br>
 Glacial ethanoic acid (acetic acid), concentrated hydrochloric acid, concentrated nitric acid and ammonia produce poisonous or extremely irritating gases or vapours.<br>
 So use the fume cupboard when removing stoppers from bottles of these acids.<br>
 Use 2 M acids from chemical suppliers.<br>
 Be Careful! Teachers who have not previously diluted concentrated to make dilute acids should ask an experienced teacher to help them.<br>
 Carefully add the concentrated acid in small quantities to 750 mL deionized water with continuous stirring.<br>
 BE CAREFUL! ALWAYS ADD ACID TO WATER!<br>
 When the solution is cool, add the rest of the water to total volume of one.<br>
 Large quantities of heat are produced when concentrated sulfuric acid is mixed with water.<br>
 Dangerous spitting that is hazardous to eyes, skin and clothing, can result from the addition of water to the acid or from the too rapid addition of the acid to water.<br>
 Allow the solution to cool before transferring to stock bottles.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.4.8H">5.4.8</a> Prepare dilute bases<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.6.0H">5.6.0</a> Prepare solutions of known concentration<br>
 When preparing solutions the number of molecules of water of crystallization shown on the bottle should be checked against the table.<br>
 If different, a new calculation is needed.<br>
 The formula after each substance is for its form provided by chemical suppliers.<br>
 In making up solutions, deionized water (or demineralized water), should be used.<br>
 If none is available, tank water is a suitable substitute.<br>
 The amount of chemical should be dissolved in about one quarter of the volume of deionized water needed and then diluted to the needed volume.<br>
 The symbol, M, stands for molarity, i.e. the number of moles of solute per litre of solution.<br>
 Usually, the masses are not exact fractions of the formula mass.<br>
 Where concentrations are needed other than those shown in preparation instructions, calculate the quantity of solute or solvent needed.<br>
 Some solutions, e.g. Ca(OH)2, limewater, react with the carbon dioxide of the air, so the solutions should be kept in sealed containers.<br>
