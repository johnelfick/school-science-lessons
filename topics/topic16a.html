<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.1.10H"></a><h3>16.1.10 Phospholipids (phosphoglycerides)</h3>
Phospholipids are the key component of cell membranes. 
In aqueous solutions, phospholipids are driven by hydrophobic interactions, which result in the hydrophobic fatty acid tails aggregating to minimize interactions 
with the water molecules. 
The result is a phospholipid bilayer: a membrane that comprises two layers of oppositely oriented phospholipid molecules, with their heads exposed to the liquid 
on both sides, and with the tails directed into the membrane. 
Phospholipids can be produced commercially and have been used in nanotechnology delivery and materials science.

Phospholipids are an important precursor for the generation of carbonyl compounds that play a significant role in the characteristic aroma of deep-fat fried food
Phospholipids form when hydroxyl groups form esters with phosphate groups.<br>
They occur as two groups:<br>
1. Phosphoglycerides, e.g. lecithin in cell membranes and in bile.<br>
Phosphatidyl choline (formerly lecithin), phosphatide with organic base choline, in biological membranes, e.g. egg yolk, is used as a natural emulsifier.<br>
Egg yolk phospholipids (EYPL) are used as carriers for lipophilic drugs and are a major ingredient of lipid microspheres.<br>
2. Sphingolipids in plant and animal cell membranes.<br>

The term "aromatic" may mean a fragrant, pungent, spicy, sweet smelling odour, usually compounds having a benzene ring, or it may refer to ring-shaped flat molecules with a ring of resonance bonds (changing forwards and backwards) as in the benzene molecule.<br>
Originally the term "aromatic" referred to compounds containing the <a href="../topics/topicIndexP.html#PhenylH">Phenyl</a> radical.<br>
Aromatics, aromatic compounds, benzene derivatives, ring systems, arenes: benzene, toluene, naphthalene<br>

(diazines: pyrazine, pyridazine, pyrimidine)<br>
Aromatics have planar ring-type groups usually composed of carbon atoms, and at least one benzene ring in the molecule, e.g. benzene, naphthalene, 
with alternating double and single bonds.<br>
Extensive localization occurs, because some electrons in the molecule are free to move from one atom to another.<br>
The term "aromatic" described the smell of some compounds, later were found to contain benzene or fused benzene rings in the structure.<br>
It includes arenes and their substitution products, e.g. benzene, naphthalene, toluene, and aromatic heterocyclic structures, e.g. thiophene.<br>

ATP, adenosine triphosphate, C10H16N5O13P3, a nucleoside triphosphate, consists of adenine C5H5N5, D- ribose C5H10O5 , triphosphate. 3(PO4)<br>
ATP is the energy carrier of all living cells.<br>
When an ATP molecule loses a phosphate bond, it becomes ADP, adenosine diphosphate, and  energy is released in the cell.<br>
Adenosine triphosphate, ATP, has three phosphate groups and the terminal third phosphate of ATP can transfer to other molecules to make them more reactive.<br>
For example the  glucose molecule can receive a phosphate from ATP phosphorylation, to become glucose-phosphate and can then be quickly broken down.<br>

Bergamottin is an inhibitor of enzyme CYP3A4 in liver and intestine, cause the "grapefruit effect" on some drugs, e.g. atorvastin (lipitor), cannot be eliminated.<br>
The bergamottin in grapefruit interferes with the action of drugs, e.g. atorvastatin, e.g. "Lipitor", to lower bad cholesterol, by blocking the action of enzymes in the small intestine to increase the amount of drug
absorbed and the action of fexofenadine, ("Allegra", allergy medicine, runny nose), by blocking the action of transporters to decrease the amount of drug to target cells.<br>
Grapefruit juice increases oral bioavailability of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 through inhibiting the enzymatic activity and decreasing the content of intestinal P450 3A4.<br>
Bergamottin also causes increased glucuronidation of bergamottin analog, so be cautious when drinking grapefruit juice and taking certain medications, e.g. statins.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="WoolwaxH"></a><h3>Wool wax</h3>
Wool fat, lanolin, but better name is "wool wax", because it is not a fat and it comes from sheep sebaceous glands.<br>
Wool wax is used in skin protection and cosmetics.<br>
Wool wax, wool grease, degras, from the scouring of wool contains fatty acid esters of cholesterol, lanosterol and fatty alcohols.<br>
It forms as semi-solid emulsion in water, which is purified to make lanolin.<br>
Lanolin is wool fat, palmitate and stearate esters of cholesterol (from sheep sebaceous glands, used in cosmetics).<br>

Terpenes are volatile aromatic hydrocarbons, which occur in many plant essential oils.<br> 
Terpenes are hydrocarbons, but terpenoids, isoprenoids, are terpenes modified by additional functional groups, usually containing oxygen.<br> 
Terpenes can be defined as a class of compounds composed of repeating 5-carbon units of hemiterpenes (one isoprene units).<br>
Terpenes are in essential oils, usually in conifers or citrus.<br>
Terpenes may be removed from essential oils to prevent oxidation spoilage.<br>
Terpenes are unsaturated hydrocarbons with of two or more isoprene C5H8, units, joined together.<br>
Terpenes are unsaturated hydrocarbons formed by polymerization of two or more 5-carbon isoprene units, CH2:C(CH3)CH:CH2, C5H8.<br>
An isoprene unit has a four carbon chain and a one carbon branch at C2.<br>
Terpenes (isoprenoids), occur mostly in plant essential oils and may be isolated as a water-insoluble oil through distillation.<br>
Terpenes contain functional groups, e.g. C=C, OH, C=O and may be acyclic or cyclic.<br>
Terpenes may be poisonous and can cause painful rashes, e.g. Manchineel tree (Hippomane mancinella), Cicutoxin water hemlock, (Cicuta douglasii).<br>
Phenolic compounds, often associated with terpenes, contain benzene rings with attached hydroxyl groups C-OH.<br>
Terpenes may be organic solvents and cleaning agents with strong characteristic odours derived from pine trees or citrus fruit, e.g.  <a href="../topics/topic16f.html#LimoneneH">Limonene</a>  Turpentine  (a mixture of terpenes).<br>
The molecular formulas of terpenes are multiples of isoprene (C5H8)n, where n = number of isoprene units, linked to form linear chains or rings.<br>
Monoterpenes, two isoprene units, C10H16  Sesquiterpenes, three isoprene units, C15H24  Diterpenes, four isoprene units, C20H32 <br>
Triterpenes, six isoprene units, C30H48  Tetraterpenes, eight isoprene units, C40H64  Polyterpenes, many isoprene units.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="TerpenoidsH"></a><h3>Terpenoids, (C5H8)n</h3>
Terpenoids include terpenes, diterpenes, sesquiterpenes<br>
Terpenoids, isoprenoids (C5H8)n, are modified terpenes.<br>
Terpenoids are the largest group of natural products and are responsible for many scents and flavours.<br>
Terpenoids are terpenes modified by oxidation or rearrangement of the carbon skeleton.<br>
Terpenoids are natural products and related compounds derived from isoprene units.<br>
Terpenoids contain oxygen in various functional groups.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="TrioxsalenH"></a><h3>Trioxsalen, C14H12O3</h3>
Trioxsalen, a furanocoumarin and a psoralen derivative, occurs in Psoralea corylifolia.<br>
It causes photosensitization of the skin and increases the skin's sensitivity to sunlight, causing serious sunburns if not properly used, increases the chance of skin cancer and cataracts.<br>
In albinism, trioxsalen will increase the tolerance of the skin to sunlight, although no pigment is formed.<br>
Trioxsalen is used in conjunction with ultraviolet light A (UVA) in the treatment is known as PUVA (psoralen plus ultraviolet light A).<br>
