Experiment<br>
The Langmuir trough experiment<br>
A trough with a moveable barrier is filled with water.<br>
Pull on the sliding barrier to increase the surface area between the moveable barrier and the wall of the trough.<br> 
As the area between th barrier and the trough wall increases, the depth of oil molecules decreases towards only one molecule thick.<br>
With a further pull on the sliding barrier, the oil can no longer cover the entire surface of the water between the barrier and the troph wall.<br> 
So the oil layer beaks into round droplets, surrounded by water molecules.<br>

Aromatic compounds are unsaturated chemical compounds with the planar rings of atoms linked by covalent bonds.<br>
The term "aromatic" may mean a fragrant, pungent, spicy, sweet smelling odour, and they are usually compounds having a benzene ring.<br>
However, "aromatic" may refer to ring-shaped flat molecules with a ring of resonance bonds (changing forwards and backwards) as in the benzene molecule.<br>
Originally the term "aromatic" referred to compounds containing the phenyl radical.<br>

Aromatics have planar ring-type groups usually composed of carbon atoms, and at least one benzene ring in the molecule, e.g. benzene, naphthalene, 
with alternating double and single bonds.<br>
Extensive localization occurs, because some electrons in the molecule are free to move from one atom to another.<br>
The term "aromatic" described the smell of some compounds, later were found to contain benzene or fused benzene rings in the structure.<br>
It includes arenes and their substitution products, e.g. benzene, naphthalene, toluene, and aromatic heterocyclic structures, e.g. thiophene.<br>

ATP is the energy carrier of all living cells.<br>
When an ATP molecule loses a phosphate bond, it becomes ADP, adenosine diphosphate, and energy is released in the cell.<br>
Adenosine triphosphate, ATP, has three phosphate groups and the terminal third phosphate of ATP can transfer to other molecules to make them more reactive.<br>
For example the glucose molecule can receive a phosphate from ATP phosphorylation, to become glucose-phosphate and can then be quickly broken down.<br>

Bergamottin is an inhibitor of enzyme CYP3A4 in liver and intestine, cause the "grapefruit effect" on some drugs, e.g. atorvastin (lipitor), cannot be eliminated.<br>
Bergamottin in grapefruit interferes with the action of drugs, e.g. atorvastatin, to lower bad cholesterol, by blocking the action of enzymes in the small intestine to increase the amount of drug absorbed and the action of fexofenadine, ("Allegra", allergy medicine, runny nose), by blocking the action of transporters to decrease the amount of drug to target cells.<br>
Grapefruit juice increases oral bioavailability of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 through inhibiting the enzymatic activity and decreasing the content of intestinal P450 3A4.<br>
Bergamottin also causes increased glucuronidation of bergamottin analog, so be cautious when drinking grapefruit juice and taking certain medications, e.g. statins.<br>

Terpenes are unsaturated hydrocarbons with of two or more isoprene C5H8, units, joined together.<br>
Terpenes are unsaturated hydrocarbons formed by polymerization of two or more 5-carbon isoprene units, CH2:C(CH3)CH:CH2, C5H8.<br>
An isoprene unit has a four carbon chain and a one carbon branch at C2.<br>
Terpenes (isoprenoids), occur mostly in plant essential oils and may be isolated as a water-insoluble oil through distillation.<br>
Terpenes contain functional groups, e.g. C=C, OH, C=O and may be acyclic or cyclic.<br>
Terpenes may be poisonous and can cause painful rashes, e.g. Manchineel tree (Hippomane mancinella), Cicutoxin water hemlock, (Cicuta douglasii).<br>
Phenolic compounds, often associated with terpenes, contain benzene rings with attached hydroxyl groups C-OH.<br>
Terpenes may be organic solvents and cleaning agents with strong characteristic odours.<br>
They occur in pine trees or citrus fruit, e.g. Limonene, Turpentine (a mixture of terpenes).<br>
The molecular formulas of terpenes are multiples of isoprene (C5H8)n, where n = number of isoprene units, linked to form linear chains or rings.<br>
Monoterpenes, two isoprene units, C10H16 Sesquiterpenes, three isoprene units, C15H24 Diterpenes, four isoprene units, C20H32<br>
Triterpenes, six isoprene units, C30H48 Tetraterpenes, eight isoprene units, C40H64 Polyterpenes, many isoprene units.<br>

Terpenoids, (C5H8)n, include terpenes, diterpenes, sesquiterpenes<br>
Terpenoids, isoprenoids (C5H8)n, are modified terpenes.<br>
Terpenoids are the largest group of natural products and are responsible for many scents and flavours.<br>
Terpenoids are terpenes modified by oxidation or rearrangement of the carbon skeleton.<br>
Terpenoids are natural products derived from isoprene units.<br>
Terpenoids contain oxygen in various functional groups.<br>

2. Beta-terpinene, (p-Mentha-1(7),3-diene), no known natural source, but prepared synthetically from sabinene in oil of savin.<br>
3. Gamma-terpinene, (Delta-terpenine), terpinolene, (p-Mentha-1,4-diene), smoke or wood smell<br>
It occurs in coriander, cumin, lemon, samphire, apple, lilac, tea tree, Valencia orange oil, Rau om.<br>

Trioxsalen, C14H12O3, a furanocoumarin and a psoralen derivative, occurs in (Psoralea corylifolia).<br>
It causes photosensitization of the skin and increases the skin's sensitivity to sunlight, causing serious sunburns if not properly used, increases the chance 
of skin cancer and cataracts.<br>
In albinism, trioxsalen will increase the tolerance of the skin to sunlight, although no pigment is formed.<br>
Trioxsalen is used in conjunction with ultraviolet light A (UVA) in the treatment is known as PUVA (psoralen plus ultraviolet light A).<br>
