 Do this experiment in a fume cupboard or fume hood.<br>
 <b>Be careful!</b> A hot molten solid is formed and choking poisonous fumes are given off!<br>
 Lead (II) bromide has a comparatively low melting point salt at 373<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 Melt the lead (II) bromide in a crucible and pass 12 V through it with carbon electrodes.<br>
 The only ions in this melt are bromide ions and lead ions.<br>
 Lead has lower melting point, 328<sup>o</sup>C, and greater density than lead (II) bromide, so it appears as a melt at the bottom of the crucible.<br>
 Note the small globule of lead at the negative electrode, the cathode, after 10 minutes of electrolysis.<br>
 Decant the molten lead bromide carefully into another crucible.<br>
 Note the bromine gas, b.p. 59<sup>o</sup>C, at the positive electrode, the anode.<br>
 The electric current has split crystalline lead bromide into bromine gas and lead metal.<br>
 Reduction at the cathode: Pb<sup>2+</sup> (l) + 2e<sup>-</sup> --> Pb (l)<br>
 Oxidation at the anode: 2Br<sup>-</sup> (l) - 2e<sup>-</sup> --> Br2 (g)<br>

 Use a U-tube with carbon electrodes that dip into the solution.<br>
 Add some 6 M hydrochloric acid.<br>
 Fill the U-tube to 2 cm from the openings.<br>
 Insert a two-holes rubber stopper in each opening of the U-tube for the electrode and for a delivery tube for gas collection.<br>
 Use 6 to 12 V current.<br>
 Higher voltage speeds the reaction.<br>
 Test the liquid at each electrode with litmus paper.<br>
 At the anode, the reaction produces chlorine instead of oxygen.<br>
 2Cl<sup>-</sup> (aq) --> Cl2 (g) + 2e<sup>-</sup><br>
At the cathode, the reaction forms hydrogen gas from water molecules.<br>
Sodium ions collect in the solution, but are not discharged, so the cathode is surrounded by sodium hydroxide solution.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="15.6.4H">15.6.4</a> Electrolysis of copper (II) sulfate solution with copper and platinum electrodes<br>
 Refining is used to remove impurities from metals by electrolysis to get pure metals.<br>
 The cathode is a thin sheet of copper.<br>
 The electrolyte is copper (II) sulfate solution.<br>
 The anode is the impure copper to be refined.<br>
 During electrolysis the pure copper leaves the anode and is deposited on the cathode leaving the electrode as a mass of impurities.<br>
 The equations show how impure copper is purified by the electrolysis of a copper (II) sulfate solution.<br>
The impure copper is the anode and a sheet of pure copper is the cathode.<br>
 The anode corrodes and pure copper is deposited on the sheet of pure copper.<br>
 Attach a copper electrode to the positive terminal of a 6 V battery and a platinum electrode to the negative terminal.<br>
 Immerse both electrodes in copper (II) sulfate solution in a beaker.<br>
 Copper plates on the platinum electrode and the copper anode corrodes.<br>
 Cu<sup>2+</sup> + 2e<sup>-</sup> --> Cu<br>
 Reverse the connections.<br>
 The copper plated on the platinum electrode corrodes from it and plates on the copper cathode.<br>

<a href="../images/3.69.4ch.gif">See diagram 3.69.4</a>: Electrolysis on an overhead projector<br>
 Place a transparent dish half full of a 10 g in 100 mL copper (II) sulfate solution on an overhead projector.<br>
 Cut one end of a 1 cm wide strip of copper foil into a sharp angle and hang it on one side of the flat transparent dish with the sharp end under the copper (II) sulfate solution.<br>
 Peel the plastic cover off one end of a short length of electric wire, then disperse the thin copper wires.<br>
 Hang the electric wire on the other side of the dish with the thin copper wires immersed in the solution.<br>
 Connect the copper strip to the positive terminal of a 12 V DC supply and connect the thin copper wires to the negative terminal.<br>
 Adjust the distance between the two electrodes.<br>
 No bubbles appear at the electrodes.<br>
 When electric current passes, note the changes to the electrodes.<br>
 The sharp end of the anode gradually dissolves.<br>
 At the cathode, copper deposits on the thin copper wires, like a branching tree.<br>
 The cathode is covered with a fresh layer of copper.<br>
 The anode looks dull.<br>
 The weight of copper lost by a pure copper anode equals the weight of copper gained by the cathode, but the concentration of the copper (II) sulfate electrolyte remains the same.<br>
When using copper (II) sulfate solution and copper electrodes, the graph of current against voltage is a straight line, so the solution acts as an electrical conductor and Ohm's law applies.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="15.6.6H">15.6.6</a> Electrolysis of silver nitrate solution, with an OHP<br>
Observe the electrolysis of silver nitrate solution under a microscope or with an overhead projector.<br>
Use a 2 mm wide strip silver cathode, a platinum anode, a 2M solution of silver nitrate and a power source less than 2 V.<br>
Attach the electrodes to a microscope slide with adhesive tape leaving 1.5 mm between the tips.<br>
Use a dropper to put 2 drops of 2M silver nitrate solution between the electrodes.<br>
Turn on the power and increase it slowly with a potentiometer.<br>
Crystals of silver form around the cathode depending on the voltage and the shape of the cathode.<br>
Black Ag(I)Ag(III)O2 and some bubbles, probably oxygen, appear around the anode.<br>
Reverse the circuit to watch reversal of the electrolytic reactions.<br>
In this reaction oxidation of Ag(I) to Ag(III) occurs more easily than oxidation of hydroxide to oxygen.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="15.1.01H">15.1.01</a> Electroplating<br>
To electroplate a metal is to coat it by electrolytic deposition, e.g. chromium plating, silver plating, to protect the metal from corrosion and to improve the appearance.<br>
You can pass electric current through an electric cell, called an electroplating bath, to deposit one metal on another.<br>
The metal to be electroplated must first be cleaned and then placed in a solution of a compound of the used for the coating in the electroplating.<br>
 The metal is then connected to a battery and it becomes the cathode, the negative electrode, in the electroplating process.<br>
 Positive metallic ions, e.g. copper, gold, silver zinc, form a coating on the metal.<br>
 Metal may be taken from the anode and deposited on metal articles that act as cathodes.<br>
 The electrolyte contains the metal to be deposited as ions.<br>
 A salt of the plating metal is the electrolyte, e.g. chromium salt for chromium plating.<br>
 Electroplating is not the same as anodizing that forms an oxide on the metal.<br>
 Put two pieces of the same metal, e.g. pieces of wire, or two metal spoons or knives in a copper (II) sulfate solution.<br>
 Connect the pieces of metal to a battery.<br>
 The metal joined to the negative terminal of the battery will become the cathode and the other piece of metal will become the anode.<br>
 Close the circuit and note the coating of copper on the surface of the cathode.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="15.1.1H">15.1.1</a> Faraday's first law<br>
 (Michael Faraday 1791-1867)<br>
Faraday's first law states that the amount of chemical change during electrolysis is proportional to the charge passed, i.e. the quantity of electricity passed.<br>
 A coulomb is the quantity of electricity that passes when one amp of current passes for one second.<br>
 One Faraday (F) = 96, 500 coulombs.<br>
 One mol of electrons (one Faraday) corresponds to 96 500 coulombs.<br>
 Q = i × t<br>
 1 coulomb = 1 amp × 1 second.<br>

 Pass current at 0.25 amps.<br>
 Every 15 minutes rinse the cathode with deionized water dry with air, then weigh it.<br>
 Compare the weights of deposited copper to check whether they agree with Faraday's first law.<br>

 1. Dip a clean iron nail into copper (II) sulfate solution.<br>
 The quickly becomes coated with a layer of copper.<br>
 2. Clean a key in dilute hydrochloric acid, wash with water and polish with steel wool.<br>
The plating bath contains 70 g copper (II) sulfate crystals dissolved in 500 mL of water, 25 mL of methylated spirits, 15 mL concentrated sulfuric acid and grains of clear gelatine.<br>
 The plating current is 0.5 amps.<br>
 If the plating current is too strong, a spongy layer forms on the electrode and you can easily rub off the layer of copper.<br>
 3. Use a 6 volt battery.<br>
 Attach a copper electrode to the positive terminal and attach a platinum electrode to the negative terminal.<br>
 Immerse both electrodes in copper (II) sulfate solution in a beaker.<br>
 Observe any changes.<br>
 Copper is plated onto the platinum electrode and is corroded from the copper anode.<br>
 After a few minutes, reverse the connections and observe any changes.<br>
 The copper that had plated onto the platinum electrode was corroded from it and plated onto the copper cathode.<br>
 4. Coat a non-conductor, e.g. wood, rubber or plastic, with graphite powder.<br>
 The copper wire in the non-conductor must contact the graphite.<br>
 Then use it as a cathode to electroplate a non-conductor.<br>
 5. In a beaker of copper sulfate solution place a clean strip of brass to act as the cathode (negative electrode) and a carbon rod to act as the anode (positive electrode).<br>
 The electrodes should not touch.<br>

 1. Cutlery may be made of nickel, but plated with silver.<br>
 The letters "EPNS" stamped into some "silver" spoons means "Electroplated Nickel Silver".<br>
 Use a silver anode and a copper or nickel cathode cleaned in concentrated nitric acid until the surface is matted.<br>
 The plating current is 1 amp per cm<sup>2 </sup>for 10 minutes.<br>
 The deposit is dull, but becomes shiny after polishing.<br>
 The electrolyte, plating bath, contains 1 g silver nitrate in 20 mL water,<br>
<b>or</b>,<br>
Use 1 litre of water containing 40 g silver nitrate, 560 g potassium iodide and 2.8 mL concentrated sulfuric acid.<br>
 2. The procedure is the same as with copper except that the electrolyte is a solution of about 1 g silver nitrate in 20 mL water.<br>
 The deposit will be dull.<br>
 Shiny electroplated deposits are usually obtained by vigorous mechanical polishing of the dull film produced in the first instance.<br>

 Dissolve the ammonium chloride in warm water.<br>
 Add the zinc chloride and stir until dissolved.<br>
 Dissolve the other salts in a small amount of warm water, and pour them one by one into the chloride solution.<br>
 After stirring, add more water to reach the desired volume.<br>
 Adjust the pH value of the solution to between 5.4 and 6.2 by using citric acid or concentrated aqueous ammonia solution.<br>
 Pour the fresh electrolyte into a beaker.<br>
 Place a glass rod across the mouth of the beaker.<br>
 Clean the surface of the object to be plated, i.e. the copper strip, remove grease, polish with fine sandpaper, and wash with water.<br>

 Hang from the glass rod a strip of polished copper and a strip of polished zinc.<br>
 Leave a safe distance between the two strips.<br>
 Connect the copper strip electrode to the negative terminal of a 1.5 V battery.<br>
 Connect the zinc strip electrode to the positive terminal of the battery.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="15.1.8H">15.1.8</a> Anodize aluminium<br>
(anode Greek <i>anodos</i>: the way up)<br>
To anodize is to give a metal, usually aluminium, a positive coating by an electrolytic process where the metal is the anode.<br>
Anodizing is the electrochemical conversion of the aluminium surface to a hard aluminium oxide surface that can be coloured with organic dyes or inorganic metal compounds.<br>
It is called anodizing, because it thickens the oxide layer on the anode.<br>
Use anodizing to remove oxides from the surface of objects then coat them with a hard and thick oxide layer, which can absorb dyes or hardening agents.<br>
Anodized dyed aluminium is used for door and window frames, saucepan lids, and wherever bright reflective surfaces are required.<br>
Anodized steel is used in small objects for marine construction and anodized titanium is used for shiny jewellery.<br>
1. <a href="../images/12.1.11.gif">See diagram 12.1.11</a>: Anodizing aluminium<br>
Line a beaker with aluminium foil to act as a cathode.<br>
Add 50 mL of 1 M (10%) sulfuric acid.<br>
Clean the surface aluminium sheet by putting it 1 M sodium hydroxide for a few seconds, then in 2 M nitric acid for a few seconds.<br>
Rinse the strip in running tap water, dry it with cotton wool, then rinse it again.<br>
Fold the aluminium strip over a pencil to act as an anode.<br>
Place the strip in the sulfuric acid with the pencil acting as a support over the rim of the beaker.<br>
Connect the cathode and anode to a 12 volt DC power supply.<br>
Remove the aluminium strip after ten minutes and observe the change in the surface of the metal.<br>
Colour the aluminium strip in a boiling organic dye, e.g. cochineal, eosin, alizarin.<br>
Seal the dyes into the surface of the strip by putting it into boiling water.<br>
2. <a href="../images/15.1.8chd.gif">See diagram 15.1.8.1</a>: Anodize aluminium<br>
Put two pieces of aluminium foil in hot sodium hydroxide solution to remove any aluminium oxide layer.<br>
Rinse in water, then nitric acid, then water.<br>
Use the two pieces of aluminium as electrodes in dilute sulfuric acid solution connected to a 6 volt battery.<br>
Let electric current flow for 15 minutes.<br>
The piece of aluminium attached to the positive terminal, the anode, now has a layer of aluminium oxide.<br>
Put this piece of aluminium in a water and a dye, e.g. alcohol solution of congo red (blue in acid and red in alkali).<br>
Heat the solution to 70<sup>o</sup>C and leave for 15 minutes.<br>
The aluminium oxide layer absorbs the dye.<br>
Seal in the dye by putting the anodized metal in boiling water for 15 minutes.<br>
3. Degrease a 12 cm × 3 cm thin aluminium strip by wiping with propanone (acetone).<br>
Dip the lower half of the aluminium strip in 1.4 mol per litre sodium hydroxide until effervescence occurs indicating removal of the aluminium oxide layer.<br>
Dip the cleaned half in nitric acid to neutralize the sodium hydroxide.<br>
Dry the strip without touching it and weigh.<br>

4. Line a 1 litre beaker with double aluminium foil.<br>
Fill beaker with 2 mol per litre sulfuric acid at 25<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
Clamp the aluminium strip in the centre of the beaker so that the cleaned half is in the sulfuric acid electrolyte.<br>
Use crocodile clips to complete the circuit, the aluminium strip is positive (the anode), the aluminium foil is negative (the cathode).<br>
Adjust the power pack and rheostat to give an electric current density of 10 to 20 mA per cm<sup>2.</sup><br>
If the anode area = 3 cm × 3 cm, then area = 3 × 3 × 2 (2 sides) = 18 cm<sup>2</sup>, so current needed = 18 × 10 to 20 = 180 to 360 mA (0.18 to 0.36 A).<br>
Close circuit for about 30 minutes, but keep adjusting the rheostat to keep the current constant.<br>
At the anode: 2Al (s) + 3H2O (l) --> Al2O3(s) + 6H<sup>+</sup> (aq) + 6e<sup>-</sup><br>
At the cathode: 6H<sup>+</sup> (aq) + 6e<sup>-</sup> --> 3H2(g)<br>
Combined equation: 2Al (s) + 3H2O (l) --> Al2O3(s) + 3H<sup>+</sup> (g)<br>
Be careful! Hydrogen gas is given off, so do not allow any naked flames in the laboratory!<br>
Remove aluminium strip, rinse in water and put in dye solution, e.g. a cold fabric dye.<br>
Seal the dye by putting the aluminium strip in boiling water.<br>
The oxide coating develops a positive charge that attracts dyes containing coloured anions.<br>
The porous oxide layer traps the coloured anions that become sealed in by a layer of Al2O3.H2O, formed by heating in boiling water.<br>

Plating and deplating silver on metals or glass are not suitable experiments for schools, but students may know about the reactions.<br>
Plating metal surfaces or "resilvering" old mirrors should be done only by chemical companies that specialize in this work, because dangerous arsenic compounds must be used.<br>
Recovery of silver from photographic and X-ray fixers has perhaps environmental significance, because it stops metallic silver entering the water supply.<br>
Silver can be electroplated from fixer solutions with a stainless steel cathode to form a silver flake metal sludge of silver-thiosulfide complex.<br>

Silver on mirrors or scrap photographic film can be reclaimed with nitric acid to form silver nitrate, or by iron (III) chloride in hydrochloric acid or iron (II) chloride solution to form silver chloride.<br>
More active metals, e.g. copper, zinc aluminium and iron, can replace less reactive silver in a galvanic response.<br>
However, for a large scale processes, iron is preferred, because its salts least pollute the environment.<br>

1. Obtain two carbon rods from old torch cells.<br>
Put them, not touching, in a 10% solution of copper (II) sulfate, 10 g copper (II) sulfate crystals, 90 mL water.<br>
Connect to two torch cells in series.<br>
Observe the surface of the rods after ten minutes and note any changes.<br>
Replace the rods and reverse the leads to the cell.<br>
Note what happens.<br>
2. Use an article, say of brass, iron or silver, which you wish to electroplate with copper.<br>
Iron is not suitable, because, immersed in copper (II) sulfate solution, it partly dissolves and a loose adherent of coating of copper forms.<br>
Connect the article to the battery connection from which the hydrogen gas was produced in the previous experiment.<br>
The electrolyte is a solution of copper (II) sulfate (about 10%) in water.<br>
The other electrode can be copper wire.<br>
When a current is passed through the circuit, a film of copper gradually appears on the article being plated.<br>
Simultaneously, copper will be dissolved from the copper wire electrode that after a time becomes noticeably eaten away.<br>
Copper is deposited at one electrode and passes into solution at the other electrode.<br>
3. Pass electric current through copper (II) sulfate solution.
Use a 250 mL beaker, a piece of cardboard, two carbon rods from old dry cells, and dilute copper (II) sulfate solution.<br>
The carbon electrode connected to the positive wire is the anode and the electrode connected to the negative wire is the cathode.<br>
The copper (II) sulfate solution is the electrolyte.<br>
The cathode becomes coated with copper and the coating becomes thicker the longer the current is flowing.<br>
The copper (II) sulfate solution becomes less blue after about one hour, because copper leaves the solution and onto the cathode.<br>
So the blue colour of the solution was caused by the copper in it.<br>

A voltmeter measures electric potential in volts.<br>
A voltameter, coulometer, is an electrolytic cell, consisting of a container, electrolyte and electrodes, used to find the amount of electricity that has flowed during electrolysis by measuring the products of the process, e.g. the weight of substances gained or lost by the electrodes.<br>
A voltameter, coulometer, measures electric current by measuring the amount of metal deposited or gas liberated from an electrolyte in given time caused by the passage of the current, with SI unit the coulomb.<br>
An Hofmann voltameter, is used to demonstrate the decomposition of water into hydrogen gas and oxygen gas.<br>
 It has platinum electrodes that are too inert to allow deposition of any chemical on them.<br>
Voltameters were used to measure current before the invention of the ammeter.<br>
Electrochemical coulometers are used to measure the concentration of different ions in solution by plotting the relation of current and voltage in a micro electrode and for chemical analysis where quantities are found from how much electricity is used for the electrolysis.<br>
Experiments.<br>
2H2O (l) --> 2H2 (g) + O2 (g)<br>
1. Pure water is a poor conductor of electricity so add a small quantity of an electrolyte to improve conductivity, e.g. dilute H2SO4 or KNO3 or Na2SO4.<br>
 Fill the cylinder and two test-tubes with the acidified water.<br>
 Put a finger over each test-tube and invert it over an electrode.<br>
 Add bromothymol blue indicator.<br>
 Connect the cell to a 12 V DC supply and use a current of 1 A.<br>
 Watch for bubbles of gas at both electrodes, but if no bubbles appear, add more acid.<br>
 Note that when the first test-tube is full of gas, the second test-tube is only half full of gas.<br>
 Remove each test-tube when it becomes full of gas.<br>
 Keep the test-tube inverted and apply a stopper.<br>
 Test for hydrogen gas with a lighted splint, match test, that causes a sharp popping sound.<br>
 Test for oxygen with a glowing splint, match test, that reignites to form a flame again.<br>
 Two volumes of hydrogen gas form at the cathode for each volume of oxygen that forms at the anode.<br>
 Repeat the experiment by swapping the leads to the battery and replacing the test-tubes.<br>
The sequence of filling the test-tubes is reversed.<br>
The acid in the electrolyte remains constant, so the hydrogen gas and oxygen gas have come from the electrolysed water that has decreased in volume.<br>
At the anode: 2H2 O (l) --> O2 (g) + 4H<sup>+</sup> (aq) + 4e<sup>- </sup> [loss of electrons from the solution to the circuit]<br>
[Bromothymol blue is yellow in acidic solutions.]<br>
At the cathode: 4H2O (l) + 4e<sup>-</sup> --> 2H2(aq) + 4OH<sup>-</sup> (aq) [gain of electrons from the circuit to the solution]<br>
 [Bromothymol blue is blue in basic solutions.]<br>
 Overall reaction: 2H2O (l) --> 2H2 (g) + O2 (g)<br>
[Bromothymol blue is green in neutral solutions.]<br>
2. Stir into the water sodium sulfate and test it again.<br>
 Compare the results.<br>
Water alone does not conduct electricity, but the addition of sodium sulfate, or any electrolyte, makes it conduct.<br>
Pure water does not conduct an electric current, but if an electrolyte is added to it the water conducts and, with many electrolytes, is decomposed into its elements, hydrogen and oxygen.<br>
Hydrogen gas forms at the cathode and oxygen forms at the anode.<br>
But sometimes the electrolyte itself is decomposed.<br>
Use a voltameter to prepare hydrogen electrolytically and collect the gas in an inverted small borosilicate test-tube.<br>
<a href="../images/15.5.4ch.gif">15.5.4</a> Hofmann voltameter apparatus<br>

4. Prepare hydrogen / oxygen mixture by electrolysis of dilute acid / detergent mixture in a beaker.<br>
 Collect the gases produced from both electrodes a funnel set beneath the surface of the liquid.<br>
 The bubbles that float on the surface explode away from the funnel when ignited with a taper.<br>
5. Water by itself does not conduct an electric current, but does so if an electrolyte is added to it.<br>
 Fill your small 2 delivery tubes beaker with water and stir in a finger width of sodium hydrogen sulfate.<br>
 When the powder has dissolved, pour the clear liquid into the U-tube so that the level is at least 3 mm below the sidearm.<br>
 The U-tube must be well supported, exactly vertically.<br>
 One way to do this is to place it in a cup, with wads of paper to keep it in position.<br>
 Push the stoppers containing the carbon rods firmly, but into the U-tube.<br>
 Fit the delivery tubes to the sidearm of the U-tube with the special rubber connections.<br>
 Make the delivery tubes from your glass tubing.<br>
 The end of each delivery tube projects into an inverted test-tube of water in a deep dish.<br>
 Support the test-tubes with cork-lined apparatus clamps.<br>
 When all is ready, the chemical alone in the beaker.<br>
 Wash the carbon rods in clean water between each test.<br>
Record your observations as to any signs of chemical reaction in the beaker.<br>
 As soon as the connection is made bubbles of gas will be seen coming from the carbon rods.<br>
 The gases enter the inverted test-tubes, thereby displacing water into the dish.<br>
 The gases are hydrogen gas and oxygen, from the decomposition of the water, and there is twice as much of one as of the other.<br>
 Note whether the hydrogen gas comes from the cathode (negative connection to the battery) or the anode.<br>
 Remove each test-tube when full, place your finger or thumb over its mouth, and tests for hydrogen gas and oxygen.<br>
 The experiment forms twice as much hydrogen gas as oxygen by volume.<br>
 Fit the delivery tubes to the sidearm of the U-tube with the special rubber connections.<br>
 You have to make the delivery tubes from your glass tubing.<br>
 The end of each delivery tube projects into an inverted test-tube of water in a deep dish.<br>
 Support the test-tubes with cork-lined apparatus clamps.<br>
 When all is ready, the carbon rods projecting from the stoppers are connected by conducting wire and crocodile clips to the battery.<br>
 Two batteries connected in series form quicker results.<br>
 Hydrogen gas forms at the cathode.<br>

 Use a variable voltage supply or 12 volt battery.<br>
 Place two 250 mL burettes over the electrodes.<br>
 Open the taps of the burettes and fill with acidified water until the burettes are completely filled.<br>
 Close the switch and adjust to a value of 1 amp.<br>
 Allow the current to flow for twenty minutes.<br>
 After opening the switch, slide the burettes in holding clips until the levels of the water inside and outside the tube are the same.<br>
 Observe the volumes of the gases evolved.<br>
 With acidified water and platinum electrodes the graph of current against voltage shows current almost zero until voltage exceeds 1.7 volts, so Ohm's law does not apply.<br>
 During electrolysis of water, or electrolysis of an aqueous solution of a salt, e.g. KNO3 or Na2SO4, the following reactions occur:<br>
 O2 + 4H<sup>+</sup> + 4e<sup>-</sup> <-- 2H2O, ( E<sup>o</sup> = + 0.82 V)<br>
 4H2O + 4e<sup>-</sup> --> 2H2 + 4OH<sup>-</sup>, (E<sup>o</sup> = -0.41 V)<br>
 So the minimum voltage for electrolysis of pure water = + 0.82 -(-0.41) = 1.23 V<br>

(Position of hydrogen ions is lower than sodium ions in the electrochemical series.)<br>
Chloride ions and hydroxide ions move towards the anode.<br>
At the anode, chloride ions are oxidized to form chlorine gas.<br>
2Cl- (aq) --> Cl2 (g) + 2e<sup>-</sup><br>
(Position of hydroxide ions is higher than chloride ions in the electrochemical series.<br>
But the concentration of chloride ions is much greater than hydroxide ions, so they are preferentially discharged.<br>

 When sodium chloride solution is electrolysed, chlorine gas is evolved at the anode and much of it dissolves in the water causing the swimming pool smell.<br>
 Chlorine is a bleaching agent, so it turned the litmus colourless near the anode.<br>

 The hydrogen gas and oxygen gas formed will be in a 2: 1 ratio by volume, because the net reaction is electrolysis of water.<br>
 Local changes in pH There should be no net change in pH of the electrolyte, but localized changes may occur.<br>
 Loss of hydrogen ions at the cathode leaves the electrolyte near the cathode with a net excess of hydroxide ions, basic solution.<br>

 Fill the porous pot and beaker with a saturated solution of sodium chloride.<br>
 Add drops of phenolphthalein solution to the solution outside the pot.<br>
 Connect the iron wire gauze to the negative terminal of a 6 volt battery to make it the cathode.<br>
 Put a carbon rod into the porous pot to make it the anode.<br>
 Hydroxyl ions form at the cathode.<br>
 Phenolphthalein turns red.<br>
 The solution at the anode bleaches wet litmus paper, because chlorine is formed.<br>
 At the anode: 2Cl<sup>-</sup> (aq) - 2e<sup>-</sup> --> Cl2 (g)<br>
 At the cathode: H2O + 2e<sup>-</sup> --> H2 (g)+ OH<sup>-</sup><br>

 Pass a current through copper sulfate solution.<br>
 Pass the current for three or four minutes and examine the electrodes.<br>
 Oxygen from the water is formed at the anode, but no hydrogen gas is evolved.<br>
 Instead, the metal, copper, is deposited as a film on the cathode.<br>
 The cathode has a deposit of copper on it, which can be wiped off.<br>

 The electrolyte is a saturated solution of copper (II) sulfate + 5% sulfuric acid.<br>
 The copper voltameter has two clean copper electrodes attached to the sides of a glass jar by clips fitted with terminals so that the cathode can be removed and replaced in the same place.<br>
 Connect three similar circuits carrying currents adjusted by rheostats to carry A. 1 amp, B. 0.5 amp and C. 0.5 amp.<br>
 If electrodes have an immersed area of 8 × 5 cm, current of 1 amp corresponds to a current density of about 0.025 amp per cm<sup>2 </sup>and current of 0.5 amp corresponds to current density of about 0.012 amp per cm<sup>2</sup>.<br>
 Wash and dry the cathodes then clean with emery paper.<br>
 Weigh the cathodes and place into the three circuits.<br>
 Close the three switches simultaneously.<br>
 After ten minutes, open the switch in the circuit carrying A.<br>
 1 amp and open the switch in the circuit carrying B. 0.5 amp.<br>
 After twenty minutes, open the switch in circuit carrying C. 0.5 amp.<br>
 Remove the cathodes then wash, dry and weigh them again.<br>
 The weight of copper carried across is proportional to current × time.<br>
 The first law of electrolysis, discovered by Michael Faraday, states:<br>
 The mass of substance liberated during electrolysis is proportional to the charge passed.<br>
 If mass/charge = the electrochemical equivalent constant of the substance.<br>
 Faraday's second law states:<br>
 The amount of chemical produced in different substances by a quantity of electricity is proportional to the electrochemical equivalent constant of the substance.<br>

<a href="../images/15.5.16.gif">See diagram 15.5.16</a>: Electrolysis of copper (II) sulfate solution, microscale electrolysis<br>
 Microscale electrolysis allows very fine observation of changes during electrolysis.<br>
 1. Attach fine copper wire to platinum wire and pass the end of the wire under the lid of a Petri dish to form the anode.<br>
 In bright light, clean the tip of a piece of the fine copper wire, inspect it with a magnifier then pass the end under the lid of the Petri dish to form the cathode.<br>
 Tape the electrode wires to the bottom of the Petri dish with tips separated by 5 millimetres and tape the electrode wires to the side of the Petri dish where they pass over the sides.<br>
 Put two drops of concentrated copper (II) sulfate solution (10 g to 100 mL water) in the Petri dish so that the tips of both electrodes are touching the solution.<br>
 Place an extra two drops of copper (II) sulfate solution aside to compare colour change. Put specks of solid copper (II) oxide in the solution between the tips of the electrodes.<br>
 Spread the specks to form a continuous band in the solution between the electrodes.<br>
 Put the lid on the petri dish and connect the electrodes to a 3V source of direct current.<br>
 Connect the platinum anode to the positive terminal.<br>
 Connect the copper cathode to the negative terminal.<br>
2. Use a magnifying glass to observe changes around the electrodes and the specks of copper oxide.<br>
 When the circuit is closed, deposits of copper appear on the cathode, but the rate of deposition later changes.<br>
 The grains of copper oxide start to disappear into the solution.<br>
 When the growth of copper deposited on the cathode reaches a grain of copper oxide, copper is deposited rapidly around the grain.<br>
 Note the bubbles around the anode and later around the cathode.<br>
 The bubbles may stream from one electrode towards the other electrode.<br>
 Hold a lighted taper above bubbles appearing at the electrodes.<br>
 Note the popping noise indicating hydrogen gas.<br>
 The blue colour of the solution fades more quickly at the cathode.<br>
 Increase the voltage briefly to 6 volts then back to 3 volts and observe any changes.<br>
 Change the space between the electrodes and observe any changes.<br>
 Place the electrodes parallel instead of tip to tip any observe any changes.<br>

Faraday's first law of electrolysis states that the mass of an element deposited or liberated in electrolysis is proportional to the current and to the time for which the current flows.<br>
 Remove the cathode from the voltmeter, thoroughly clean it on both sides, first with emery cloth, and then with deionized water.<br>
 Calculate the total surface area of the cathode that will be immersed in the electrolyte.<br>
 Allow 0.02 amps per cm<sup>2</sup> of the surface area.<br>
 Replace the cathode, avoiding touching the surface with the fingers, and connect the circuit.<br>
 Close switch S and adjust the rheostat to the calculated current three minutes to prepare the surface of the cathode.<br>
 Remove the cathode, wash it in deionized water, then in methylated spirits, dry thoroughly in a current of warm air and weigh it.<br>
 Replace the cathode, close switch S and record the time.<br>
 Allow the current to flow for 30 minutes.<br>
 Use the rheostat to maintain the current constant, I amps.<br>
 After 30 minutes, open the switch, record the time and remove the cathode.<br>
 Wash and dry the cathode and weigh again.<br>
 The mass of copper deposited will be very small.<br>
