Fixed oils (non-volatile oils, true oils, vegetable oils, aromatherapy carrier oils) are extracted from seeds or nuts by different methods.<br>
They can be classed as "unrefined", "cold-pressed", "expeller-pressed", "refined", and extracted using solvents, heat and/or steam.<br>
Fixed oils:<br>
* make a permanent greasy mark on paper,<br>
* cannot be distilled unchanged,<br>
* do not evaporate at room temperature, so are called "carrier oils", but do not volatilize on heating without decomposition,<br>
* are glycerides of fatty acids,<br>
* harden on exposure to the air.<br>
 Fixed oils, base oils, carrier oils are oily, non-volatile, usually from the seed or nut.<br>
 They are called "fixed oils", because they have large molecules so do not evaporate like essential oils.<br>

<a href="../images/Quinine.png">See diagram</a>: Quinine.<br>
Quinine, C20H24N2O2, is an antimalarial, antipyretic, gives a pale blue colour by reflected light and no colour by transmitted light.<br>
It is extracted from the bark of Cinchona ledgeriana (quinine tree, "fever tree"), and Remijia in South America.<br>
It was formerly an anti-malarial medicine and is still used for treatment of some heart conditions.<br>
As a medicine it was taken in carbonated mineral water, but nowadays is still taken as a beverage called "tonic water".<br>
Commercial tonic water, is valued for the slightly bitter taste of "gin and tonic", but tonic water is not a medicine.<br>
Quinine must be identified on the label of commercial products containing it, because some people are hypersensitive to quinine.<br>
Cinchona was discovered in the 1630s as a treatment for malaria and was the only effective cure known in Europe until synthetic replacements in the 1940s.<br>
Malaria remains today one of the deadliest diseases known throughout the tropics, and until the 20th century the disease was prevalent throughout Europe.<br>
The Cinchona tree is native to the eastern slopes of the Andes, across Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia, so inaccessible for most Europeans during the 17th century.<br>
In the 18th and 19th centuries, demand outstriped supply and threats of overharvesting and the desire to control the source caused empires to source this plant.<br>
The Spanish tried to prevent this access, but failed to establish their own successful plantations.<br>
The Dutch, in Indonesia, and the British, in India, founded government controlled plantations for mass production of quinine.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="16.3.23H">16.3.23</a> Essential oils, volatile oils, ethereal oils.<br>
 Essential oils are not really "oils", i.e. not smooth, sticky liquids, immiscible in water, but are volatile oils obtained by distillation and having the characteristic 
 odour of the plant from which it is extracted.<br>
 A "note" is a term used in perfumery, meaning any of the basic components of a fragrance of a perfume which give it its character.<br>
 Reference: The Encyclopedia of Essential Oils, by Julia Lawless, Thorsons, Harper Collins, 2002, ISBN 0 00 7145187.<br>
 1. An essential oil is a concentrated, hydrophobic liquid that volatilizes on heating without decomposition to form the distinctive scents of plants.<br>
 Essential oils are used in aromatherapy and in religious ceremonies requiring 
the burning of incense.<br>
 2. They are usually liquid, but may be solid, e.g. orris, or semi-solid, e.g. rose.<br>
 3. On exposure to air, they do not harden, but, unlike fixed oils, evaporate, leaving no oily residue.<br>
 4. They dissolve in alcohol, fats and oils, but not in water.<br>
 5. They are mainly volatile mixtures of terpenes and terpenoids, and may contain aliphatic and aromatic esters, phenolics and hydrocarbons from plant oil glands.<br>
 6. Essential oils are not recommended for pregnant women.<br>
 7. For consumption recipes, buy only top quality essential oils from a reputable source.<br>
 Buy "Therapeutic" grade or "Food Grade" and never buy perfume grade or diluted or solvent extracted essential oils.<br>
8. Essential oils include rose oil, jasmine oil, oil of cloves, lavender oil, peppermint oil, eucalyptus oil, ylang-ylang oil (Cananga odorata),<br>
and the cheap citrus oils, e.g. lemon oil, sweet orange oil.<br>
 They are extracted by distillation, expression and solvent extraction.<br>
 They cause plant odours, to be be distilled to form perfumes, cosmetics, bath products, flavouring food and drink flavourings, incense scents.<br>
 They may also contain substances that deter insects and herbivores<br>from damage or grazing.<br>
 9. Volatile oils.<br>
 An essential oil is usually regarded as a volatile oil produced by distillation with the odour characteristic of the distilled plant material.<br>
 However, the term is often used loosely in the herbalist and aromatherapy industries to describe any usually aromatic extracts from plant material.<br>
10. Extraction.<br>
 Plant material --> (distillation) --> "distilled essential oilsH"><br>
 Plant material --> (expression, i.e. pressing and squeezing) --> "citrus oilsH"><br>
 Plant material --> (solvent extraction) --> "concretes" --> "absolutesH"><br>
 Plant material --> (solvent extraction) --> "resinoidsH"><br>
 Plant material --> ("enfleurage") --> "pomades --> "enfleurage absolutesH"><br>
Concretes.<br>
 The "concretes" are extracted from raw previously-living plant material with hydrocarbon solvents, not steam distillation.<br>
 They are usually about 50% wax and 50% volatile oil, e.g. jasmine.<br>
 The oil ylang ylang is 20% wax and 80% essential oil.<br>
 The term "concretes" may refer to the fact that they are more concentrated and stable than distilled essential oils.<br>
Resinoids.<br>
 The "resinoids " are extracted from dead resinous material with hydrocarbon solvents to produce balsams, resins, oleoresins, oleo gum resins.<br>
Absolutes.<br>
 The "absolutes" are extracted from the "concretes" by further solvent extraction using "absolute alcohol" (pure ethanol) to remove most of the wax.<br>
 Nowadays more pure "absolutes" are produced with liquid carbon dioxide.<br>
Pomades.<br>
 The "pomades" were once produced by pressing cut flowers onto a glass plate covered with odourless fat, a process called "enfleurageH"><br>
 The volatile oils from the flowers that had diffused into the fat were extracted with alcohol to produce "enfleurage absolutesH"><br>
Nature identical.<br>
 The pharmacy industry can produce most essential oils 96% synthetically, labelling them "nature identical" products.<br>
 However, the 4% of natural constituents may be important to the herbalist and aromatherapy.<br>
