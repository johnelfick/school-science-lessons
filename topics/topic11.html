<a href="https://www.teaching.com.au/search?action=search&q=Motion">Motion</a> Brownian, sensor, wave motion. (MTA)<br>
1. Brownian motion, named after Robert Brown, (1773-1858, Scotland).<br>
He was the botanist employed by Sir Joseph Banks, (1743-1820), on the voyage of the "Investigator" to Australia in 1801.<br>
Robert Brown published his observations in 1827.<br>
He had noticed the jittery random movement of pollen grains thought to be caused by the pollen grains themselves.<br>
However, he showed that similar random movement could also be seen if any solid material of similar size was observed.<br>
A small particle suspended in a liquid executes a haphazard zigzag movement, because of the uneven buffeting from the molecules of liquid that bombard it.<br>
This random movement of microscopic particles suspended in a liquid is caused by an imbalance of combined impact forces of solution molecules on much<br>
larger irregularly-shaped solute particles.<br>
In 1905, Albert Einstein was fascinated by this movement.<br>
He wrote, "The existence of a never diminishing motion seems contrary to all experience.<br>
This difficulty was splendidly clarified by the kinetic theory of matter".<br>
His statistical calculations of the mass and number of molecules involved, lead to the final acceptance of the atomic theory by scientists.<br>
2. In investigating the pollen of different plants, Robert Brown, in 1828, observed that this became dispersed in water in a great number of small particles.<br>
They were perceived to be in uninterrupted and irregular "swarming" motion.<br>
The phenomenon repeated itself with all possible kinds of organic substances.<br>
He believed that he had found in these particles the "primitive molecule" of living matter.<br>
He found later that the particles of every kind of inorganic substance presented the same phenomenon.<br>
He drew the conclusion that all matter was built up of "primitive molecules.".<br>
3. Albert Einstein's "simple theory of this phenomenon" was to review from consideration of diffusion and osmotic pressure,diffusion and irregular motion of molecules.<br>
He used van 't Hoff's law, Maxwell's law of distribution of velocities and Stokes' law, (Zeit. f. Elektrochemie, 14, 1908, pp. 235-239).<br>
Before Einstein, different scientists noted that the motion:<br>
was caused by irregular heating, incident ligh.<br>
persisted unchanged for a whole year when the liquid was sealed up between two cover glasses,<br>
is most rapid with the smallest particles,<br>
is increased by ultraviolet light and heat rays,<br>
has its origin in the impacts of the molecules of the liquid on the particles,<br>
is the more lively the smaller the viscosity of the liquid,<br>
is caused by the thermal molecular motions of the liquid and the velocity of the movement decreases with increase of size of the particles,<br>
increases with rise of temperature<br>
is not caused by forces exerted by the particles on one another, temperature differences, evaporation, electrical forces intensity of illumination, strong, electromagnetic fields.<br>
4. Einstein explained that the pollen grains are buffeted by collisions with molecules of water moving randomly in all directions<br>
Einstein's theory and Perrin's observations showed that the mean distance travelled by a pollen grain is subject to random collisions increases as the square root or time distance x time t, whereas in straight line motion, x t<br>
5. In direct confirmation of Einstein's formula, photographs of cinnabar particles every 0.1 second showed average displacement inversely proportional to the viscosity<br>
Jean Baptiste Perrin, 1870-1942, France, and his students verified Einstein's explanation of this phenomenon<br>
The method was to prepare a suspension of gamboge or mastic with particles of exactly equal to be enclosed in a microscopic chamber<br>
The distribution in height of the particles was determined, after equilibrium, by counting the particles in different layers above the bottom of the chamber<br>
A small screen in the ocular of the microscope allowed only a few particles in the field of vision.<br>
So a great number of observations were arranged for different sizes of particles<br>
With the acceptance of the explanations for Brownian motion the existence of atoms and molecules became accepted<br>
Also, Perrin calculated the value for Avogadro's number, the number of atoms in a mole<br>
Experiments<br>
1. Put a drop of toothpaste on a microscope slide and stir water into it until it is almost colourless.<br>
Put a coverslip over the drop and examine it with a microscope under high power with the stage illuminated from the side.<br>
Pay attention to one particle.<br>
At first it appears to stay in one place.<br>
Later you can see that it is moving with an irregular jerky movement in all directions.<br>
The irregular movement is caused by molecules of water hitting unevenly on the sides of the particle.<br>
This experiment does not work with the modern "gel" type of toothpaste.<br>
2. Make a model using a tray containing many small, light beads and one large marble.<br>
The small beads represent molecules of water and the large marble represents a particle of suspended graphite.<br>
Shake the tray and note how the small beads hit the marble from all directions.<br>
The forces tend to cancel so the large marble may just make very small irregular movements, but returns to the same place.<br>
3. Observe dirty water in sunlight.<br>
Fill a beaker with tap water and focus sunlight into the beaker with a magnifying glass.<br>
You may see the motions of suspended particles of solid matter.<br>
4. Observe smoke in still air.<br>
The smoke particles suspended in the air show Brownian movement.<br>
Use a microscope to observe the movement of particles in a smoke cell.<br>
5. Use a microscope to observe the movement of particles in a smoke cell.<br>

Chemical reactions are influenced by the conditions under which they take place and, being reversible, may reach a state of equilibrium.<br>
Chemical reactions occur at different rates and changing the nature of the reactants, temperature, or concentration, or introducing a catalyst, may alter these.<br>
Chemical reactions may be reversible.<br>
Reversible chemical reactions may reach a state of dynamic balance known as equilibrium, which, when disturbed, will be re-established.<br>
Specific criteria can be used to classify chemical reactions.<br>
Redox reactions involve a transfer of electrons and a change in oxidation number.<br>
Precipitation reactions result in the appearance of a solid from reactants in aqueous solution.<br>
Acid-base reactions involve transfer of protons from donors to acceptors.<br>
Polymerization reactions produce large molecules with repeating units.<br>
Chemical reactions involve energy changes.<br>
All chemical reactions involve energy transformations.<br>
The spontaneous directions of chemical reactions are towards lower energy and greater randomness.<br>
Chemical reactions, but not nuclear reactions, obey the law of conservation of mass.<br>
The mass of the products is equal to the mass of the reactants.<br>
In a balanced chemical equation, the number of atoms of each element in the reactants is equal to the number of atoms in the product.<br>
Ionic equations show soluble ionic compounds in solution as separate ions and the sum of charges on the product side is equal to the sum of charges on the reactant side.<br>
Chemical equation: HCl (aq) + NaOH (aq) --> NaCl (aq) + H2O (l)<br>
Ionic equation: H+ (aq) + Cl- (aq) + Na+ (aq) + OH- (aq) --> H2O (l) + Cl- (aq) + Na+ (aq)<br>
The Cl- and Na+ ions are called spectator ions, because they are on both sides of the equation and do not react.<br>
Cancel the spectator ions to leave the net ionic equation: H+ + OH- --> H2O<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="11.3.1H">11.3.1</a> Burn steel wool and burn iron filings<br>
 1. Collect oxygen in test-tubes with stoppers.<br>
 Store test-tubes in a test-tube rack and remove the stoppers just before inserting the burning element.<br>
 Fasten steel wool to wire.<br>
 Heat the steel wool in a burner flame.<br>
 Put it into a test-tube of oxygen.<br>
 The steel wool burns with bright sparkles to form black-grey iron oxide.<br>
 4Fe (s) + 3O2 (g) --> 2 Fe2O3 (s)<br>
 iron + oxygen --> iron oxide<br>
 2. Repeat the experiment by placing iron filings in a sieve and shaking it over a Bunsen burner flame.<br>
 A shower of sparks occurs as in some fireworks.<br>
 3. Hold an iron nail against a grinding wheel.<br>
 Friction breaks the iron into little pieces and heats them until they ignite and become white hot, like sparks from a fire.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="11.3.2H">11.3.2</a> Burn steel wool, change in weight<br>
 Roll some steel wool into a ball in your hands and weigh it.<br>
 Hold it with tongs over a sheet of paper.<br>
 Heat the steel wool until red hot; remove the flame, and blow gently on the red hot steel wool until it stops burning.<br>
 When cold, weigh the steel wool and any fragments fallen onto the sheet of paper, on the balance.<br>
 When iron burns, the product formed, iron oxide, is heavier than the iron.<br>
 4 Fe (s) + 3 O2 (g) --> 2 Fe2O3 (s)<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="11.3.3H">11.3.3</a> Burn sulfur in oxygen<br>
 Dip a wire loop into sulfur powder. Ignite the sulfur in a burner flame and then put it into a test-tube of oxygen.<br>
 The sulfur burns with a bright blue flame to form the colourless gas sulfur dioxide.<br>
 S (s) + O2 (g) --> SO2<br>
 sulfur + oxygen --> sulfur dioxide<br>
 Some sulfur trioxide may also form in this reaction.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="11.3.4H">11.3.4</a> Copper cycle reactions<br>
<a href="../images/1.13a.gif">See diagram 1.13a</a>: Simple fume hood<br>
 Step 1. Convert copper metal to copper nitrate<br>
 1. Weigh 1.000 g of copper wire.<br>
 It must be clean, bright and shiny.<br>
 Twist the wire into a flat spiral and put it in a beaker in a fume hood.<br>
 Slowly add 4.0 mL of 16 M nitric acid. <b>Be careful!</b><br>
 Note the brown fumes of nitric oxide (NO) nitrogen dioxide (NO2)
 and dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4), i.e. NOx.<br>
 When all the copper is dissolved, add 100 mL of deionized water.<br>
 Cu (s) + 8HNO3 (aq) --> 3Cu(NO3)2 (aq)+ 4H2O (l) + 2NO (g) [dilute nitric acid]<br>
 Cu (s) + 4HNO3 (aq) --> Cu(NO3)2 (aq) + 2H2O (l) + 2NO2 (g) [concentrated nitric acid]<br>
 N2O4 &lt; --> 2NO2 [in equilibrium]<br>
 Step 2 Convert copper nitrate to copper hydroxide<br>
 Add 30.0 mL of 3.0 M sodium hydroxide to the solution while stirring.<br>
If red litmus paper does not turn blue in the solution, add more sodium hydroxide.<br>
 Note the precipitate of copper hydroxide, an ionic solid.<br>
 Cu(NO3)2 (aq) + 2NaOH (aq) --> Cu(OH)2 (s) + 2NaNO3 (aq)<br>
 Step 3 Convert copper hydroxide to copper oxide<br>
 Heat the solution on a hot plate while continually stirring to prevent bumping caused by steam bubbles.<br>
 Note the precipitate changing to a black solid, copper oxide, CuO.<br>
 Carefully decant the liquid, add deionized water and decant again.<br>
 Heat the precipitate until it becomes a firm mass.<br>
 Cu(OH)2 (s) + heat --> CuO (s) + H2O (l)<br>
 Step 4 Convert copper oxide to copper sulfate<br>
 Reaction 4: Converting copper oxide to copper sulfate<br>
 Add 15 mL of 6.0 M sulfuric acid to the copper oxide while swirling, not stirring, the copper oxide to help it dissolve.<br>
 CuO (s) + H2SO4 (aq) --> CuSO4 (aq) + H2O (l)<br>
 Step 5 Convert copper sulfate to copper metal<br>
 CuSO4 (aq) + Zn (s) --> ZnSO4 (aq) + Cu (s)<br>
 In the fume hood add 2.0 g of zinc metal and keep stirring until the solution becomes colourless.<br>
 The zinc is oxidized as it reduces the copper.<br>
 Add one drop of the solution to 1 mL of concentrated ammonia solution in a test-tube.<br>
 If the ammonia turns deep blue, some unreduced copper is till in the solution so the reaction is not finished.<br>
 When all the copper is reduced, decant the liquid and add 20.0 mL of 6M hydrochloric acid to dissolve excess zinc.<br>
 Note the bubbles of hydrogen gas until the reaction is complete.<br>
 Cool the beaker and observe the metallic copper settling on the bottom.<br>
 Carefully decant the solution and wash the copper metal with deionized water and decant again.<br>
 Transfer the copper to an evaporating dish using a small amount of deionized water.<br>
 Decant excess water evaporating dish then wash the precipitate with methanol.<br>
 Decant the liquid the gently heat the precipitate on a hot plate.<br>
 If you heat the copper precipitate too strongly, it will oxidize to copper oxide.<br>
 Transfer the dried copper metal to a preweighed beaker and calculate the mass of recovered copper.<br>
 Percentage recovery = mass of recovered copper / initial mass of copper × 100.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="11.3.5H">11.3.5</a> Effervescent tablets, health salts, sodium bicarbonate, (baking soda)<br>
<a href="../images/12.1.1ach.gif">See diagram 12.1.1a: </a> Conservation of matter<br>
 When a chemical reaction occurs, matter is neither created nor destroyed.<br>
 The mass of the reactants = the mass of the products.<br>
 1. Effervescent tablets or "fruit salts" contain sodium hydrogen carbonate, and dry citric acid or tartaric acid.<br>
 Put the tablet or fruit salts in water in a test-tube.<br>
 Carbon dioxide forms as bubbles and any other substance in the tablet or fruit salts dissolves easily.<br>
 Tests for carbon dioxide by holding a test-tube containing limewater at an angle near the mouth of the test-tube containing the effervescent tablet.<br>
 The carbon dioxide given off by effervescence is heavier than air and will roll into the limewater test-tube where the limewater will turn milky, because of the presence of carbon dioxide.<br>
 Weigh an effervescent tablet or fruit salts and put into the bottom corner of a small plastic bag.<br>
 Twist the bag above the corner and tie around the twist with thin string or wire.<br>
 Weigh the plastic bag + string + effervescent substance.<br>
 Pour a known amount of water into the open bag then tie string tightly to close the bag so that no liquid or gas can escape.<br>
 The weight of the water + bag + string + effervescent substance is now known.<br>
 Undo the string around the twisted part of the bag and untwist the bag.<br>
 The acid and sodium hydrogen carbonate dissolves in the water and react to produce a salt and carbon dioxide.<br>
 Weigh the bag and products of the reaction.<br>
 The weight is the same.<br>
2. Place a small amount of water in a plastic cup and place on the pan of the electronic scale.<br>
 Cover the top with a piece of paper or metal foil.<br>
 Place two Alka-Seltzer tablets (ant-acid tablets), on top of the cover.<br>
 Record the initial mass.<br>
 Tilt the cover so that the tablets drop into the water and immediately replace the cover so water droplets will not escape.<br>
 Record the mass reading until it is constant.<br>
 Repeat this experiment with the cup enclosed in a sealed container.<br>
3. Place a small amount of water in a large 2 litre plastic drink bottle.<br>
 Break two Alka-Seltzer tablets in pieces that will fit in the bottle.<br>
 Weigh the bottle, bottle cap, and Alka-Seltzer tablets together.<br>
 Drop the Alka-Seltzer tablet pieces into the bottle and quickly replace the bottle cap tightly and place back on the scale.<br>
 Record the mass reading until it is constant.<br>
 The results differ from the experiment done in an open container.<br>
 Remove the bottle from the scale, loosen the bottle cap, and measure again the weight of the bottle and its cap.<br>

1. Chemical bonds are forces of attraction between the atoms together in a molecule or a crystal.<br>
All chemical bonds are caused by attractive force between positive and negative particles.<br>
2. The three main types of bonding are ionic, covalent and metallic bonding.<br>
3. Chemical bonding is about atoms and electrons arranging into lower energy states.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="11.2.2H">11.2.2</a> Bond energy (bond strength)<br>
The bond energy needed to break both of the two O-H bonds in water, H-O-H, is 459 kJ mol-1.<br>
Relative bond strengths<br>
The van der Waals bonds strengths × 10 = hydrogen bonds strengths × 10 = non-polar covalent bonds strengths, then covalent bonds 
strengths, then ionic bonds strengths, then metallic bonds strengths.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="11.2.3H">11.2.3</a> Construct molecular models<br>
The physical and chemical properties of chemical substances are largely influenced by their shape, e.g. the polarity of a molecule and subsequent intermolecular forces.<br>
 This can be demonstrated by the construction of chemical models requiring the use of geometric skills.<br>
 Use models to show the different kinds of bonding between atoms to form molecules and ions.<br>
 1. Use polystyrene spheres to represent ions in the sodium chloride crystal lattice.<br>
 Cut holes in a plate to take the bottom layer of spheres then construct layers of spheres.<br>
 Join the spheres with small springs to show how the ions may vibrate about mean positions.<br>
 2. Use corks to represent atoms or ions and use hooks or pins to represent bonds.<br>
 2.1 Construct ionic crystals: halite NaCl, calcite CaCO3.<br>
 2.2 Construct covalent crystals: diamond C, quartz SiO2, ice H2O, sulfur S8.<br>
 2.3 Construct alkanes: methane CH4, ethane C2H6, propane C3H8, butane C4H10, 2-methylpropane C4H10, CH3.CH.CH3.CH3<br>
 2.4 Construct alkanoic acids: methanoic acid HCOOH, ethanoic acid CH3COOH, propanoic acid C2H5COOH, butanoic acid, (butyric acid), C3H7COOH, CH3CH2CH2.COOH, 2-methylpropanoic acid, (isobutyric acid) C4H8O2, (CH3)2-CH-COOH<br>
 2.5 Construct organic molecules: PVC (polyvinyl chloride, poly-chloroethane) (CH2Cl.CH3)n, polypropylene (-CH3.CH.CH2-)2, polystyrene (-C6H5.CH.CH2-)n, 
 nylon-66, -NH2(CH2)6NH2CO(CH2)CO-}n<br>
 2.6 Construct biochemical models: (+) glucose C6H12O6, sucrose C12H22O11 starch / cellulose (C6H11O5)n, fat C57H110O6, tripalmitin) polypeptide (-CH[CH3]CO.NH-)n, DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid).<br>
 3. Molecular models set, e.g. "Molymod", stick and ball, organic set, inorganic set (toy product)<br>
 3.1 The plastic straw, represents a single covalent bond or a "C=O" double bond.<br>
 3.2 The flexible straw, 2 flexible straws represent a "C=C" double bond.<br>
 3.3 The 4-pronged tetrahedral carbon centre (black), represents C in "-C-".<br>
 3.4 The 3-pronged trigonal planar carbon centre (black), represents C in "&gt;C=O".<br>
 3.5 The one-pronged hydrogen centre (white), represents "H".<br>
 3.6 The one-pronged oxygen centre (red), represents O in "&gt;C=O".<br>
 3.7 The 2-pronged V-shaped oxygen centre (red), represents O in "-O-H".<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="11.2.4H">11.2.4</a> Covalent bonds<br>
 1. Covalent bonds form by sharing of electrons.<br>
 Pairs of atoms may be bound together by the sharing of electrons between them in a covalent bond.<br>
 Two or more atoms bound together by one or more covalent bonds form a molecule, with definite size, shape and arrangement of bonds.<br>
 An atom or group of atoms covalently bound together may gain or lose one or more electrons to form ions.<br>
 2. Non-polar covalent bonds exist between two or more, usually identical, atoms, e.g. H: H.<br>
 Each atom donates one electron to form a pair of electrons that are equally shared by the two atoms.<br>
 Non-polar covalent bonds (co-ordinate covalent bonds), in ammonium ion NH4+, have electrons shared between the atoms and are not soluble in polar solvents, e.g. water, but are soluble in non-polar solvents, e.g. hexane.<br>
 3. Polar covalent bonds form when atoms of two different elements each donate one electron to form a shared pair of electrons, but one atom has a greater share than the other atom.<br>
 Some people say that the shared electrons spend more time around one atom than the other atom, so this kind of covalent bond has a sort of ionic character.<br>
 Polar covalent bonds exist as a dipole, e.g. the H-Cl bond in hydrogen chloride.<br>
 The H end has a small +ve charge and the Cl end has a small -ve charge.<br>
 Water, H2O, is a polar molecule, a dipole with a definite positively charged end and a definite negatively charged end, because each H has a small +ve charge, H+, and the O has a small -ve charge, O2-.<br>
 Dipole-dipole bonds occur between polar molecules where the slightly positive end of one molecule is attracted to the slightly negative end of another molecule.<br>
 Dipole-dipole forces are intermolecular forces between molecule dipoles at δ + and δ - areas.<br>
 Solids with covalent bonds within the molecules with van der Waals forces or weak dipole to dipole intermolecular forces have low melting points and no electrical conductivity.<br>
 5. Molecules may be saturated, i.e. have only single bonds, --, or unsaturated, i.e. contain multiple bonds, e.g. double bond =, or triple bond, e.g. carbon monoxide, CO, C≡O.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="11.2.5H">11.2.5</a> Hydrogen bonds<br>
 1. Hydrogen bonds are weak intermolecular forces of attraction between polar molecules that contain hydrogen, i.e. between the H atom of one molecule 
and the negative charged atoms in another molecule.<br>
 In water, there is weak attraction between the hydrogen in a water molecule with the oxygen (in the OH) of another water molecule.<br>
 In water, each hydrogen nucleus is bound to the central oxygen atom by a pair of electrons shared between them, a covalent chemical bond.<br>
 Two of the six outer shell electrons of oxygen are used, leaving four electrons as two non-bonding pairs.<br>
 The four electron pairs around the oxygen are as far apart as possible to reduce repulsion between their negative charges.<br>
 However, the two non-bonding pairs stay closer to the oxygen atom and exert a stronger repulsion against the two covalent bonding pairs, and so pushing the two hydrogen atoms closer together.<br>
 These forces cause the H-O-H angle, 104.5o.<br>
 The positive and negative charges are not distributed uniformly.<br>
 The negative charge is concentrated at the oxygen end of the molecule, because of the non-bonding electrons and oxygen's high nuclear positive charge.<br>
 This charge displacement causes an electric dipole.<br>
 The partially-positive hydrogen atom on one water molecule is electrostatically attracted to the partial negative oxygen on a neighbouring molecule by a process is called hydrogen bonding.<br>
 That hydrogen bond is weak.<br>
 In his 1931 book, "The Nature of the Chemical Bond", Linus Pauling described the hydrogen bond as an electrostatic attraction between hydrogen atoms and areas of high electron density in certain other elements, such as oxygen or nitrogen.<br>
 2. Intermolecular force between strongly electronegative atom, e.g. F, O, N, and a H atom covalently bonded to an electronegative atom.<br>
 The hydrogen ion is the positive ion, H+, a proton, formed when a hydrogen atom loses its electron.<br>
 The hydrogen ion may become solvated to form the hydrated ion H3O+, the hydronium ion.<br>
 Hydrogen bonds are weak bonds caused by the electrostatic attraction between strongly electronegative atoms and a hydrogen atom covalently linked to another electronegative atom.<br>
 The polarized water molecule is a dipole with each H+ linked to the one O2- by a polarized covalent bond.<br>
 The hydrogen bonds are inter-molecular bonds between polar molecules containing hydrogen.<br>
 So, in water, the H+ of one water molecule is attracted to the O2- of another water molecule.<br>
 Hydrogen bonds between water molecules only, cause the force of cohesion and surface tension.<br>
 Hydrogen bonds between water molecules and other molecules, e.g. the molecules in glass, cause the force of adhesion.<br>
 Electronegativity refers to an atom attracting to itself electrons in covalent bonds.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="11.2.6H">11.2.6</a> Intermolecular bonds<br>
 Intermolecular bonds exist between molecules and between atoms.<br>
Intermolecular bonds hold together solids and liquids, but they are stronger in solids and cause the close-packed ordered arrangement of particles.<br>
 Strong intramolecular bonds in liquids cause high boiling points.<br>
 Smaller molecules usually have lower boiling points.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="11.2.7H">11.2.7</a> Ionic bonds, electrovalent bonds, e.g. sodium chloride.<br>
Ionic bonds, electrovalent bonds, form by transfer of electrons<br>
Ionic bonding occurs when positive and negative ions are held together in a crystal lattice by electrostatic forces.<br>
Ionic bonds are electrical links between atoms caused by the distribution of electrons around the nuclei of the bonded atoms.<br>
Ionic solids are usually transparent and have high melting points and boiling points.<br>
When an ionic solid, e.g. sodium chloride, NaCl, dissolves in water, the cations and anions separate, e.g. Na+ and Cl-.<br>
Solids with ionic bonds have high melting points and low electrical conductivity.<br>
However, when molten or in solution, their electrical conductivity is high.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="11.2.8H">11.2.8</a> Liquids with different viscosity, hydrogen bonds<br>
The viscosity's are different mainly, because of difference in hydrogen bonding.<br>
Pour 100 mL of the different liquids into separate conical flasks, e.g. | glycerol (glycerine | glycol | water | methylated spirit | 
benzene | concentrated sulfuric acid 18 M.<br>
 <b>BE CAREFUL!</b><br>
Swirl each flask equally and note the relative time until the disappearance of each vortex.<br>
Use this method to show that a mixture of two organic liquids is more viscous than the viscosity of either pure substance.<br>
This is caused by hydrogen bond formation.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="11.2.9H">11.2.9</a> Metallic bonds<br>
 In solid metals or alloys, the atoms exist in a lattice of positive ions with electrons moving freely between them.<br>
 Metals (metallic bonds) have high melting points and are good electrical conductors, because the outer electrons are held loosely.<br>
 Metals are ductile and malleable, because the metallic bonds are weak.<br>
 However, alloys with other metals strengthen the lattice and so improve mechanical strength.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="11.2.10H">11.2.10</a> Network solids<br>
 Network solids have atoms in a lattice of strong covalent bonds, e.g. C (diamond) Si, P (red phosphorus) B, and Ge.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="11.2.11H">11.2.11</a> van de Waals forces (van de Waals bonds)<br>
The van der Waals forces (Johannes Diderik van der Waals 1837-1923, Netherlands) are the weak forces between molecules, 
including H bonding forces in H2O and HF, dipole-dipole forces between HCl molecules and dispersion forces between Cl and Cl.<br>
The van der Waals equation: (P + a / V2)(V-b) = RT, where a = mutual attraction constant between molecules, b = space occupied by molecules, 
and V = volume of the gas.<br>
The van der Waals attraction and repulsion forces between atoms and between molecules, are caused by fluctuating polarization of atomic particles and are quite different from the forces of covalent and ionic bonding.<br>
Although the water molecule is electrically neutral, the distribution of charge is not symmetrical, causing a net attraction between molecules from momentary dipoles,(cohesion of water molecules), that affects viscosity and surface tension.<br>
Even non-polar molecules have some van der Waals bonding, although nonpolar liquids have low surface tension and low boiling points.<br>

1. Oil floats on the surface of water as a one molecule thick layer, if allowed to spread out freely.<br>
 When the water has a large enough surface area, the oil spreads out in a layer one molecule thick, because it does not form "hills" of molecules.<br>
 Knowing the volume of the oil and the area of the surface, calculate the thickness of the monomolecular layer.<br>
2. Use a thin petroleum distillate or a pure vegetable oil and a flat tray containing water.<br>
 Lightly sprinkle the surface of the water with talcum powder.<br>
 Pour oil into a burette and measure the volume of fifty drops of oil.<br>
 Let another drop of oil to fall on a piece of plastic.<br>
 Pick up oil from the oil drop with the point of a glass rod and transfer it to the water surface by touching the surface lightly.<br>
 This oil spreads out pushing out the talcum powder.<br>
 Estimate the area of the oil by comparing it with a piece of graph paper.<br>
 Estimate how much oil is removed from the oil drop by using the glass point to pick up equal amounts of oil from the oil drop until it is all removed.<br>
 Knowing the volume of the oil on the water, calculate the thickness of the oil layer.<br>
 The volume of the oil drop = area of oil picked up by point × number of "pick ups" × depth of floating oil.<br>
 The depth of floating oil = diameter of the water molecule.<br>
 The diameter of the water molecule is in the range 10-6 to 10-7mm.<br>
3. Oil floats on the surface of water as a one molecule thick layer, if allowed to spread out freely.<br>
 Use a tray with a glass bottom.<br>
 Put graph paper under the tray.<br>
 Put water in the tray.<br>
 Select a suitable oil to pour on the water, e.g. 1% oleic acid / methylated spirit solution, petroleum distillate.<br>
 Use a burette to find the volume of 100 drops of oil, then calculate the volume of 1 drop of oil.<br>
 Sprinkle the surface of the water with a very fine light powder.<br>
 Let 1 drop of oil fall from the burette onto the water.<br>
 The oil spreads out over the surface of the water, but must not touch the sides of the tray.<br>
 The oil on the water pushes the powder aside so you can easily see the area covered by the oil.<br>
 Look down on the graph paper to measure the approximate area over which it spreads.<br>
 The volume of oil put on the water = area of the oil on the water X thickness of the oil layer.<br>
 The approximate dimension of a single molecule of oil is 1 X 10-7 m.<br>
4. Another way to calculate the volume of a drop of oil is to let the drop fall on a piece of flat plastic.<br>
 Touch the oil with the point of a glass rod then touch the water surface.<br>
 Oil leaves the glass rod and spreads over the water.<br>
 Use graph paper to measure the approximate area over which the oil spreads.<br>
 To calculate the volume of oil placed on the water, keep using the glass
 rod to remove successive fractions from the flat plastic until no oil remains.<br>

<b>BE CAREFUL! Benzene may be carcinogenic.</b>.<br>
Use safety glasses and nitrile chemical-resistant gloves.<br>
Make only enough solution for immediate use.<br>
Add the solution drop by drop to the surface of water in a Petri dish.<br>
The dropper must have an outlet small enough so that there are more than 50 drops to make a total of 1 mL of the benzene solution.<br>
The benzene evaporates and leaves the stearic acid to spread over the entire water surface.<br>
The hydroxyl group of the organic acid molecule sticks into the water, because of its hydrophilic property.<br>
The hydrocarbon portion of the molecule resists entering the water surface, because of its hydrophobic property.<br>
This behaviour leads to a monomolecular film in which all the stearic acid molecules are compactly and fully arranged on the water surface.<br>
The effective section area A cm2 of each stearic acid molecule can be calculated by using the following equation: A = M × S × V / m × NA × Vd × (d-1), 
where M = molar weight of stearic acid, CH3(CH2)16COOH (284 g / mol) | S = total area of monomolecular film, | m / V = concentration of stearic acid in benzene solution (0.3700-0.3750 g / L)<br>
| NA = Avogadro's Constant (L) (6.022 × 1023 mol-1) | Vd = volume of a drop of stearic acid solution | d = number of drops of stearic acid solution.<br>
Before each determination, it is necessary to wash the Petri dish by using sodium carbonate solution and then tap water, finally distilled water 2-3 times to clear off stearic acid and base.<br>
 Repeated determination should use the same Petri dish.<br>
 Control dropping evenly to make the volume of every drop be the same.<br>
 Determine S:<br>
 Measure the inside diameter of the Petri dish to be used (~200 mm) in three directions with inside calipers (or a straight edge).<br>
 Take the average value and calculate the area (π × r2).<br>
 Determine Vd:<br>
 Use a dropper to add benzene (benzol), to a dry, small graduated cylinder until the volume reaches 1.0 mL, and count the drops.<br>
 Calculate the Vd.<br>
 Determine (d-1):<br>
 Use another dropper to add the stearic acid in benzene (benzol), solution vertically and gently at a point above the Petri dish and 1-2 cm from the water surface.<br>
 Wait for a fallen drop to diffuse until oil beads cannot be seen, and then give another drop.<br>
 Diffusion of the stearic acid solution gradually slows.<br>
 When a fallen drop cannot diffuse any more in two minutes, a monomolecular film has been formed, looking like a lens.<br>
 Record the number of drops, d, from which subtract the final drop to obtain the actual drop number needed to form the monomolecular film of stearic acid, i.e. d-1.<br>
 Repeat the determination and get the average value.<br>
 Calculate A according to the equation mentioned above.<br>
