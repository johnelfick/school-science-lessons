Science is concerned with gathering information by investigation reorganizing the information to get patterns and regularities looking for explanations and communicating findings to others.<br> 
Finding patterns and regularities simplifies the descriptions of observations.<br> 
Observations are information gained by using the senses.<br> 
Investigations may be qualitative requiring general observations or quantitative requiring counting or measuring.<br> 
Science teachers should conduct investigations so that the students can observe phenomena before listening to interpretations.<br> 
The teacher should not say too much, but should let the experiment speak for itself.<br> 
Effective teachers select content, skills and learning experiences in the subjects they teach that will foster students intellectual and personal growth.<br> 
Teachers should be able to express subject aims and goals for what students should expect to gain from their learning experiences and organize subject content coherently and at a level that is appropriate to the student group and their learning.<br> 
This document contains ideas on practical teaching for the trained science teacher.<br> 
After choosing an experiment from this book, the teacher should practice the experiment before demonstrating it to students or before requiring students to do it.<br> 
The teacher has the duty of making the decision about whether the experiment is safe for the children in the class.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="2.0H">2.0</a> Why are hands-on science activities so effective for student learning?<br>
 by Dr Donna Satterthwait, School of Education, University of Tasmania, Australia<br>
Teaching Science, Volume 56, Number 2, June 2010, pp. 7-10<br>
About the author: Dr Satterthwait has been a science teacher educator since 1991 and has a passion for "spreading the word" of science as a way of making sense of the natural world.<br> 
From effective research, there is a general consensus that hands-on experiences help students to learn.<br> 
The question that this paper seeks to answer is what it is all about these activities that fosters student learning.<br> 
In a review of the literature, three factors have been identified as making a significant contribution to this strategy's success.<br> 
They are peer interaction through co-operative learning, object-mediated learning, and embodied experience.<br> 
By taking these factors into account, teachers of science can design lessons that explicitly utilize this knowledge.<br> 
Introduction 
The experiential value of hands-on activities in science education has long been recognized as significant in engaging students.<br> 
Hands-on activities represent a strategy of teaching in which the students usually work in groups, interact with peers to manipulate various objects, ask questions that focus observations, collect data and attempt to> explain natural phenomena.<br> 
This is actually the essence of science.<br> 
Bredderman reported on the effectiveness of three of the then "new" primary science programs developed in the United States, all of which were activity-based and showed considerable benefits to participating students, because of their emphasis on the use of hands-on strategies.<br> 
In a review of further research on the hands-on learning pedagogy, such activities have been shown to improve children's science learning and achievement and their attitudes towards science, increase science skill proficiency and language development, (specifically reading and oral communication), and also to encourage creativity.<br> 
The potential for learning through hands-on activities is quite amazing.<br> 
Despite each having a different emphasis, seven innovative primary science curriculum projects funded and sponsored by the National Science Foundation, American Association for the Advancement of Science, or the US Office of Education and various large universities (e.g. Harvard, University of California), all had the use
of hands-on science activities as an essential component of their project design.<br> 
However, not only do these funding organizations, educational researchers, curriculum project leaders and designers know that hands-on activities promote better student learning outcomes, but from their own classroom experiences, most teachers of science agree.<br> 
These teachers incorporate and promote a "hands-on, minds-on" approach in their practice, because they believe their students benefit from the implementation of this strategy.<br> 
This style of teaching is also well supported by evidence in other subject areas.<br> 
The pedagogy of using hands-on investigations, Involving students working in groups, and manipulating objects has been recognized as a desired science teaching strategy for almost 200 years, and continues to influence science education curriculum design as seen in the more recently developed Australian Academy of Science-sponsored Primary Connections modules.<br> 
Thus, a question needs to be asked - why is the teaching of science through the provision of classroom hands-on science activities so efficacious?<br>
It is time to consider this pedagogic practice in light of new research on learning and to link this teaching strategy with some of the theoretical understandings that have emerged, especially from the domain of cognitive psychology.<br> 
This literature review may help to generate discussions and hypotheses that can be investigated in science classrooms.<br> 
Understanding of Learning<br>
The processes of learning are highly complex.<br> 
To make meaning of these processes, cognitive psychologists categorize what data and evidence they have collected into various "explanatory models" that provide a convenient way of communicating multifaceted ideas and serve to integrate concepts and research findings into systems that generate hypotheses and future applications.<br> 
In this way, the cognitive psychologists' knowledge of human learning can be advanced and better understood.<br> 
However, the considerable progress that has been made in understanding how learning takes place is rarely incorporated into classroom practice in a deliberate way, but teachers "know" what usually works in their own classrooms, they can predict likely outcomes of their students' engagement with particular tasks.<br> 
Good, experienced teachers have a deep understanding of their students' needs and attempt to address them as best they can to achieve intended outcomes.<br> 
One reason for the disjunct between knowledge about learning among cognitive psychologists and teachers' understanding of their students' learning is that there are many different cognitive models and psychological explanations of how learning occurs in individuals, and most have validity for particular instances that are often narrowly defined and contextual.<br> 
What happens in the reality of the classroom is so much messier than the variable-controlled investigations of psychologists.<br> 
Straightforward explanations are difficult to apply to messy classroom contexts.<br> 
The gap that occurs between the psychologist's experimental knowledge and the teacher's classroom nous is widened by the teacher's difficulty in comprehending the vocabulary of the psychologist, as well as the psychologist's lock of understanding of classroom situations.<br> 
Some psychologists may have a naive view of classroom culture, because of their long held expectations of how a classroom should operate.<br> 
Stereotypical classroom cultural expectations, which rarely reflect reality, also prevail throughout our society.<br> 
This gap between teachers and psychological knowledge becomes especially obvious in neurological or brain-based deficit studies, although recently there has been a deliberate attempt to bridge the divide, as more is being discovered about brain function.<br> 
Some neuroscientists are looking at ways in which their "models" can inform classroom learning.<br> 
The human brain appears to be highly interconnected and, like a classroom, complex and multidimensional.<br> 
Neuroscientific studies provide enticing evidence of plasticity in cellular interactions, establishment of networks and integration of neurones and neurochemicals.<br> 
Doidge gives examples of how different sections of the brain interact and function together and influence thinking, finding that imagining doing and actually doing both excite the same parts of the brain, imagining one is using one's muscles actually strengthens them.<br> 
As even more knowledge about brain function becomes available, new models about learning are likely to be proposed.<br> 
The development of these new "brain learning" models, when added to previously proposed cognitive models of learning, make the time right to re-examine cognition models and classroom practices to gain more insight and attempt to better understand why particular teaching strategies "work".<br> 
A good place to start this process is to call attention to one such pedagogy, the "hands-on activity", a well-regarded science teaching strategy and examine why this strategy seems to cause students to learn.<br> 
Although there may be many attributes that contribute to the apparent success of student learning within this way of teaching, for the purpose of this paper three factors have been identified that play a significant role in the hands-on practice.<br> 
The three factors presented in this paper are:<br>
1. The influence of co-operative learning and social constructivist understandings,<br>
2. Mediated learning through the use of objects, and<br>
3. Embodiment as a way of students gaining understanding and making meaning of their experiences.<br> 
Hands-on Experience Student Learning outcomes<br>
Peer object-mediated embodied interaction learning experience<br>
The question becomes how each factor contributes to the whole - that is, the students' learning of science.<br> 
In this paper, these three factors will be defined and then discussed in light of recent literature from research studies in cognitive psychology.<br> 
1. Peer Interaction Through Co-operative Learning<br>
 Social constructivism theory informs the teacher of the importance of co-operative group work for learning to occur among students.<br> 
Effective understanding is closely associated with co-operative learning pedagogy.<br> 
As stated by Hattie, ". . . co-operative learning has a prime effect on enhancing interest and problem solving, provided it is set up with high levels of peer involvement.<br> 
The sharing of knowledge, observations and beliefs among peers through dialogue is at the core of social constructivism".<br> 
As a translator of theory into classroom practice, Lemke, advocates that students be given an opportunity to engage in "side conversations", especially those that describe, compare or discuss real objects or events using the scientific terms in a flexible way appropriate to the situation.<br> 
Shifts in understanding need group discussions and / or arguments to enhance the creation of new meaning, so the provision of peer interactions in the classroom seems to be an especially important prerequisite for establishing thought-provoking conversations.<br> 
Numerous studies and reviews have been undertaken and published that demonstrate the key conceptual principle that humans make meaning of their encounters through the comparison of the current with the previous, that humans need to make sense of what they experience, and that they share knowledge by exchanging information through interactions with each other, usually in dialogue.<br> 
Notions of prior understanding and the discrepant event have greatly influenced how science lessons and units are planned and implemented.<br> 
Social constructivism theory informs the teacher that if an individual student's ideas are to be changed, new experiences that challenge prior knowledge need to be provided.<br> 
The teacher of science provides opportunities to challenge pseudoscientific beliefs through hands-on group work; research has demonstrated that the creation of cognitive dissonance can promote considerable knowledge transformation, to address and challenge misunderstandings.<br> 
 2. Object-mediated Learning<br>
Some of the most productive, and common, science activities are those that involve the manipulation of objects.<br> 
This factor plays a significant role in motivating and focussing our students on the learning of science through the use of objects in an activity in which they are to be engaged.<br> 
Lev Vygotsky, the educationalist often identified with social constructivism, viewed tools ("technical tools" in terms of objects, or "psychological tools" as symbols or signs), as defining and shaping human activity, not merely facilitating it.<br> 
Similarly, object-mediated learning contributes to students' learning by causing them to question or seek explanations of the effects of an object's use in particular on texts to bring about results, which at times are surprising.<br> 
It seems as if the objects themselves possess attributes that by their very nature implicitly "instruct" their usage.<br> 
What is it about the object that contributes to how it is used and what is learnt through its usage?<br>
Children have been observed to alternate between playing with objects and learning from objects, alternating between "What can I do with this object, 
and "What does this object do?" 
Manipulations of three-dimensional things deliver an event reality that is in itself intriguing and triggers curiosity among the students.<br> 
It is this physical connection to the object and the characteristics of the object that allow manipulation, and thus learning, to occur.<br> 
Often, during lab activities, students "play" with equipment in ways that are testing the object's design, construction or purpose!<br>
As well, students are more likely to remember things that elicit a positive emotional response.<br> 
Students enjoy laboratory activities, they enjoy manipulating equipment and observing the changes they cause.<br> 
Students of chemistry ranked interest in chemistry classroom investigations over demonstrations, films, discussion or lectures, and students had even more positive attitudes towards chemistry when they participated in genuine inquiry activities, rather than more traditional "recipe" practicals.<br> 
2. Embodiment 
The third factor, embodiment, is closely linked to object-mediated learning since object manipulation requires movement of the human body.<br> 
Embodied learning can be defined as how we humans make sense of our perceptions and actions as we negotiate our journey through our surroundings.<br> 
By being present, interacting with others and using equipment, an experience is created and understood through this physicality.<br> 
For example, recent data indicate that the brain is modified by the use of tools: . . . that the use of tools can change the pattern of movement, because the body schema has changed.<br> 
This comment was based on a study that provided direct evidence that using tools changes the way in which the brain detects our body parts.<br> 
The mind and the body are not separate entities, as had been thought by many philosophers, most famously, Descartes.<br> 
Rather the mind and body work synergistically to build a repository of understandings expressed in brain structure and abstract ideas.<br> 
The structure and function of the body are represented within the neural networks of the brain, and the formation of these networks is a prerequisite to being able to remember and imagine experiences.<br> 
From our varied experiences, our ability to create and imagine develops and grows as the neural network in our brain develops.<br> 
Strick, Dum and Fiez, discuss neurological data that show how the cerebral cortex, the part of the brain that has long been associated with thinking processes, links with the cerebellum, the recognized area of motor regulation.<br> 
They conclude that, ". . . the cerebellum plays a functionally important role in human cognition and affect".<br> 
It appears that the brain's anatomy and function are interconnected to all human endeavours, including learning, thinking and moving.<br> 
Perception has been shown to be intimately linked to culture.<br> 
Nisbeft and Masuda, showed that cognitive differences exist in how East Asians and Westerners.<br> 
Additionally, this is expressed in commonly used phrases that influence how we conceptualize ideas.<br> 
Language usage is indicative of the close association between understanding, experiences and brain development.<br> 
How humans move is how humans learn is how humans experience.<br> 
Implications for the science classroom 
How then can we as teachers of science incorporate these research findings into our classroom practice to enhance our students' learning experiences?<br>
Listed below are a few possible ideas that can readily be implemented with science hands-on activities.<br> 
These suggestions are not necessarily new to the practise of science teaching, but they are those practices that have been shown to enhance learning:<br>
1. Find out what students know before the lesson sequence begins, especially to identify any misunderstandings they might have and then attempt to address these through co-operative learning group science activities.<br> 
2. Foster conversations among the students that involve asking and responding to good, thought-provoking questions, set up situations where the students can play the devil's advocate.<br> 
As well, you could write a different question on a slip of paper for each science activity group.<br> 
The group discusses it and then presents their response to the class.<br> 
Other students would then be invited to agree or disagree with the response.<br> 
3. Require students to manipulate objects in usual and unusual ways and to collect this information as part of their investigation.<br> 
Perhaps include the students' ideas on how the equipment should be arranged and used, and let them try their own ideas rather than giving them a predetermined diagram or procedure.<br> 
4. Attempt to include lessons in which exploration is promoted.<br> 
When safe and appropriate, encourage students to "play" with the materials to help them identify properties (or limitations), of the objects for themselves.<br> 
Think of other ways in which we could see (or imagine), what would happen if the objects were used differently.<br> 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Summary<br>
All three of these factors, co-operative learning, object manipulation and embodiment, contribute to the underlying efficacy of hands-on activities in science education.<br> 
New ideas about how neural networks interact and integrate the totality of human experiences in the gaining of knowledge call for teachers to plan for the learning experience as a whole, rather than as smaller parts.<br> 
Teachers of science have evolved a powerful teaching strategy, the hands-on activity, that characterizes this more holistic model of learning.<br> 
Typical hands-on activities incorporate dialogue through co-operative group work, the manipulation of objects and the collection of embodied sensory inputs in conjunction with the neurobiology and aesthetics of the mind, all of which create opportunities for students to make meaning of the natural world.<br> 
Further analysis of hands-on science group work may result in a better understanding of how teachers can sustain engagement and learning among our students.<br> 
Science educators should recognize their contribution towards enhanced teaming through the implementation of the hands-on strategy.<br> 
Becoming explicitly aware of factors that characterize hands-on teaching and their potential to cause student learning, teachers of science can make explicit decisions that enhance and strengthen such learning opportunities.<br> 
These factors, along with teachers' observations of students' actions in information collection and processing, allow teachers of science to make meaning of their pedagogy and to design even more productive learning activities within which our students can engage in science.<br> 

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="2.1H"></a>2.1 What makes an activity scientific?<br>
Students identify questions that can be investigated scientifically.<br> 
They plan fair experimental methods, identifying variables to be changed and measured.<br> 
They select equipment that improves fairness and accuracy and describe how they considered safety.<br> 
Students draw on evidence to support their conclusions.<br> 
They summarize data from different sources, describe trends and refer to the quality of their data when suggesting improvements to their methods.<br> 
They communicate their ideas, methods and findings using scientific language and appropriate representations.<br> 
Based on UNESCO source book for science in the primary school by Wynne Harlen and Jos Elst-geest "A checklist for reviewing activities".<br> 
The following questions can be applied to any practical activity.<br> 
1. Handling and using objects and materials?<br>
2. Observing events and materials closely and carefully?<br>
3. Using senses other than sight?<br>
4. Trying different things with the materials to see what happened?<br>
5. Sorting and grouping the materials according to their similarities and differences?<br>
6. Discussing what was being done?<br>
7. Making some kind of record of what was being done?<br>
8. Communicating to others what was done and found?<br>
9. Comparing what was found with what others found?<br>
10. Being busy and absorbed in the activities for most of the time?<br>
11. Raising questions about the materials and the investigation?<br>
12. Puzzling over something that was found?<br>
The answer is probably "yes" to most, whichever activity you had in mind.<br> 
This means that you had experience of observing and manipulating materials, discussing and communicating about what you were doing and trying to understand what was found.<br> 
However, these things happen in many practical activities that are not 
necessarily scientific.<br> 
Answering "yes" to most of these questions shows that there was potential for scientific activity in what was experienced and to evaluate whether or not the potential was realized to some extent probing further is necessary.<br> 
 So far the questions refer to processes of observation and communication 
 and attitudes that are common to many practical activities.<br> 
 These processes and attitudes are desirable, and necessary, for scientific 
 activity, but they are not specific to it.<br> 
 To identify more specific aspects, those that distinguish scientific activity
from other activity, other questions need to be posed.<br> 
 Ask yourself whether at some point in the activity you were involved in: 
 13. Raising a question that could be answered by further investigation?<br>
 14. Suggesting a hypothesis to explain something?<br>
 15. Devising a test about the question being investigated or to another
 question arising during the investigation?<br>
 16. Identifying and controlling variables that had to be kept the same 
for a fair test?<br>
 17. Deciding what was to be compared or measured?<br>
 18. Attempting to make measurements using appropriate instruments?<br>
 19. Taking steps to refine observations using instruments where necessary?<br>
 20. Applying scientific knowledge or ideas?<br>
 21. Recording findings in a table, graph, bar chart or in another systematic
 way?<br>
 22. Seeking patterns or regularities in the results?<br>
 23. Drawing conclusions based on the evidence?<br>
 24. Comparing what was found with earlier ideas?<br>
 25. Justifying the conclusions by reference to the evidence?<br>
 26. Repeating or checking results?<br>
 27. Recognizing sources of error or uncertainty in the results?<br>
 28. Trying, or at least discussing, different approaches to the investigation or to part of it?<br>
These further questions show some aspects that are characteristic of scientific inquiry.<br> 
They go further than the previous list by asking about how the materials were manipulated, rather than just whether they were handled.<br> 
What reasons there were for doing various things?<br>
How systematic and controlled was the investigation?<br>
Were steps taken to obtain precise and reproducible results?<br>
Were scientific ideas and knowledge were being used and advanced?<br>
Using the check list for children's activities 
Now look back on the activity or activities you have done with children and ask questions 1 to 12 in relation to what the children did.<br> 
It is quite possible that you did not find so many "yes's" as you did for your own activity.<br> 
If this is the first time the children have been given an opportunity to work with materials, then quite a few "no's" would not be very surprising.<br> 
An important purpose of using the check list is to diagnose problems and improve learning opportunities.<br> 
The following suggestions about possible reasons for a few "noes" may help: 
1. What was happening?<br>
Children not handling materials 
Possible reasons: Were there enough materials?<br>
Did the children realize that they could touch and use them?<br>
2. What was happening?<br>
Very restricted observing: 
Possible reasons: Were the children really interested in the problem given?<br>
Were they distracted by something else going on?<br>
3. What was happening?<br>
Few questions raised: 
Possible reasons: Was more time needed for children to become absorbed and to realize what sorts of things they can find out through their own actions?<br>
4. What was happening?<br>
Not much discussion: 
Possible reasons: Were they used to sitting quietly in class and being told most things?<br>
Several of these problems require more time to be spent in practical activity and for children to be encouraged to use their own ideas.<br> 
It helps, however, if the investigation is introduced in a way that motivates and interests them.<br> 
It can be related to a real problem, e.g. the importance of using safe fabrics for babies' clothes.<br> 
It is very helpful to have an area of the class where a few things can be put for children to observe, play with and wonder about in their free moments.<br> 
The teacher can encourage children to bring in items for this collection and can add to it materials and objects that set the scene for topics to come.<br> 
The aspects represented in questions 13 to 28 will not all be found in every activity, but they should become increasingly common in children's experience as they become more capable of scientific thinking and inquiry.<br> 
It should not be a matter for surprise or dismay if rather few of the answers to questions 13 to 28 were "yes" in relation to children's first attempts at scientific investigation.<br> 
There are no quick answers that will change everything at a stroke; indeed the whole purpose of this book is to help in this matter.<br> 
Purposes of the check list<br>
The intention behind suggesting the check list as we have just done is not to pass judgement on an activity or experience, but rather to diagnose what aspects of scientific activity are present and what requires to be developed.<br> 
There are several other uses for the check list and we will refer to it often in later discussion.<br> 
Some examples of other uses follow: 
In relation to any activity undertaken by children it can be the basis for review and helping to answer the question: "To what extent is this activity?<br>" 
In general the more "yes's" the more chance for learning in science to be taking place.<br> 
Where science is part of integrated studies or topic-based, it is all too easy for it to remain at the level of "look and tell" or even for activities such as reading about science to be mistaken for scientific
 activity.<br> 
 Scanning the work done by the children in terms of the check list will
 indicate the extent of scientific activity.<br> 
In selecting activities, the list can be used whilst mentally scanning what would be involved when children were carrying them out; it can help in a decision concerning how worthwhile activities are in terms of their potential for learning science.<br> 
In devising or adapting activities, the items indicate the sort of opportunity that has to be planned for inclusion in classroom work.<br> 
Selecting and adapting activities<br>
In science, there is always a dual purpose in any activity: the development of children's scientific skills and attitudes, and the development of their scientific ideas.<br> 
Since skills can be used on any subject matter, they are not a basis for selecting subject matter.<br> 
 The choice of content depends on the ideas or concepts that are to be developed.<br> 
 The particular selection of concepts is often determined by the syllabus 
 to be followed.<br> 
 Although syllabuses vary, there is a core of ideas that are widely accepted 
 as basic and always included.<br> 
 Concepts about air are among these, so we take an example from this area.<br> 
 First, carry out this activity, which involves making a parachute.<br> 
 It is presented as it appeared on a worksheet for children.<br> 
 Parachute lesson<br>
 1. Cut a 35-cm square from sturdy plastic.<br> 
 2. Cut four pieces of string 35-cm long.<br> 
 3. Securely tape or tie a string to each corner of the plastic.<br> 
 4. Tie the free ends of the four strings together in a knot.<br> 
 Be sure the strings are all the same length.<br> 
 5. Tie a single string about 15-cm long the knot.<br> 
 6. Add a weight, e.g. a metal washer, to the free end of the string.<br> 
 7. Pull the parachute up in the centre.<br> 
 Squeeze the plastic to make it as flat as possible.<br> 
 8. Fold the parachute twice.<br> 
 9. Wrap the string loosely around the plastic.<br> 
 10. Throw the parachute up into the air or from a veranda or drop it from a height 
 Results<br>
 The parachute opens and slowly carries the weight to the ground.<br> 
 Why?<br>
 The weight falls first, unwinding the string, because the parachute, being
larger, is held back by the air.<br> 
 The air fills the plastic, slowing down the rate of descent.<br> 
 If the weight falls too quickly a lighter object must be used.<br> 
 Now apply the items of the check list to what you did.<br> 
 How many items did you tick?<br>
 The exact number will depend to some extent on the context in which rig, 
 but it is probably four or five from items 1 to 12 and none 
 the list.<br> 
 Why is the activity in opportunities for learning?<br>
 It could be the starting point for discussing gravity, balanced and unbalanced
forces, 
 speed and acceleration, air resistance and the properties of different 
materials.<br> 
 How can the activity be modified to make it a potentially greater learning 
 experience?<br>
 Here is a suggestion.<br> 
 It starts in the same way as before.<br> 
 Thereafter the questions and suggestions might be introduced orally by
the teacher rather than on a worksheet.<br> 
 Parachute lesson, Steps 1. to 10.<br> 
 What happens?<br>
 Does everyone's parachute do the same?<br>
 What is the same about the way all the parachutes fall?<br>
 What is different?<br>
 Why do you think that is?<br>
 If you throw up a weight not attached to a parachute, does it fall as quickly
as the one attached to the parachute?<br>
 Try it.<br> 
 Discuss with others in your group why this might be.<br> 
 Do you think that if the parachute is bigger, or smaller, it will make a difference?<br>
 Decide how you will compare how quickly different parachutes fall.<br> 
 Keep a record of how quickly the different sizes fall.<br> 
 Try each one several times.<br> 
 Look at your results and at what other groups have found.<br> 
 Do you see any patterns (one thing appearing to be related to another), 
 in the results?<br>
 What about other shapes?<br>
 Some have holes in them.<br> 
 Some are made of different materials.<br> 
 Try some of these suggestions and see how well the parachutes fall.<br> 
 Plan your investigation before you start.<br> 
 Think carefully about what you mean by how well the parachute falls.<br> 
 Is speed the only consideration?<br>
 Think what parachutes are usually used for.<br> 
 How will you measure this?<br>
 How will you make sure that the investigation is "fair", i.e. if you are
investigating different materials, that any differences are due only 
 to the material.<br> 
 Report what you have found to other groups.<br> 
 After listening to what they have done, can you think of how you might
 have improved your plan to obtain more accurate results?<br>
 Put your heads and your results together and suggest how to make a parachute, 
 which falls very slowly, but goes straight down without 
 swaying sideways.<br> 
 What else might make a difference to the parachute's fall?<br>
 Think about different weather conditions and find out how your parachutes 
 would behave in wind or rain.<br> 
 Try out any other ideas that you have.<br> 
 Now use the check list in relation to these revised parachute activities.<br> 
 It will probably be found that a very large proportion of the questions 
 can be answered with a "yes".<br> 
 This analysis should answer the objection that the time taken for the 
revised activities is so much longer than for the original.<br> 
 The point is that the learning taking place is also very much greater.
Several activities of the original type will never provide opportunities for the kind of experiences required for learning 
 science.<br> 
 A change in quality is needed, not more of the same.<br> 
 The learning time for activities of the revised kind is not more, but probably less when several such experiences are considered, because,<br> 
(a) many learning objectives are being met at the same time,<br>
(b) what is learned in terms of knowledge is learned through exploration and testing in practice - it is supported by evidence from real things and so is with understanding.<br> 
Of course, because fewer of these kinds of activities can be encountered in time, it means that they have to be carefully selected to provide maximum learning 
opportunity.<br>

<a href="websites.html#BiologyH">Biology</a>, biotechnology (websites)<br>
 1. The method of artificial variation.<br> 
 Manipulate one variable to note the effect on the other variable, e.g.
 What is the effect of temperature (the manipulated or 
 independent variable) on the enzyme digestion of starch (the dependent
 variable)?<br>
 2. The method of concomitant variation, a correlation method.<br> 
 A naturally occurring variation in some condition (Variable 1) is correlated 
 against another condition (Variable 2).<br> 
 Nature has manipulated the variables, but you can class one variable as
dependent and one variable as independent.<br> 
 Examples include the following:<br>
 2.1 Do young leaves have the same density and distribution of stomata 
as older leaves?<br>
 2.2 How does temperature in a natural environment affect stoma opening?<br>
 You do not need you to control the environmental temperature, but you 
do need to measure the dependent variable at different 
 temperatures.<br> 
 The problem is the control of other potentially influential variables, 
 e.g. humidity.<br> 
 One way to address the confounding variables, e.g. humidity, is to collect 
 data on the other variable as well.<br> 
 So call the stoma / temperature data Part I, and call the stoma / humidity 
 data Part 2, then run the statistics on each pair separately.<br>

(PISA, Programme for International Student Assessment)<br>
PISA, Scientific Literacy, 2012 "In PISA, scientific literacy is defined as:<br>
an individual's scientific knowledge and use of that knowledge to identify questions, to acquire new knowledge, to explain scientific phenomena, and to draw evidence-based conclusions about science-related issues, understanding of the characteristic features of science as a form of human knowledge and enquiry, awareness of how science and technology shape our material, intellectual, and cultural environments, and willingness to engage in science-related issues, and with the issues of science, as a reflective citizen (OECD, 2009, p.14).<br> 
Scientific literacy relates to the ability to think scientifically and to use scientific knowledge and processes to both understand the world around us and to participate in decisions that affect it.<br> 
Increasingly, science and technology are shaping our lives.<br> 
Scientific literacy is considered to be a key outcome of education for all students by the end of schooling, not just for future scientists, given the growing centrality of science and technology in modern societies.<br> 
The skill of being able to think scientifically about evidence and the absence of evidence for claims that are made in the media and elsewhere is vital to daily life.<br> 
The assessment framework for science includes three strands:<br>
Scientific knowledge or concepts constitute the links that aid understanding of related phenomena.<br> 
In PISA, while the concepts are familiar ones relating to physics, chemistry, biological sciences, and Earth and space sciences, students are required to apply the content of the items and not just recall them.<br> 
Scientific processes are centred on the ability to acquire, interpret and act upon evidence.<br> 
Three such processes present in PISA relate to:<br>
1. describing, explaining and predicting scientific phenomena,<br>
2. understanding scientific investigation, and<br>
3. interpreting scientific evidence and conclusions.<br> 
Situations and context relate to the application of scientific knowledge and the use of scientific applied.<br> 
The framework identifies three main areas: 1. Science in life and health, 2. Science in Earth and environment, and 3. Science in technology.<br>

 gestation or development" and includes amphibians, birds, fish, mammals 
 and reptiles.<br> 
 It does not include the eggs, spat or spawn of fish, nor invertebrates
 such as octopus, squid, crab, crayfish, lobster and prawn.<br> 
Further details of the categories covered by the legislation can be obtained from the PDF website: www.dpi.qld.gov.au, under "Using animals for scientific purposes" and "What is an animal?<br>
The Act also requires compliance with the Australian Code of Practice 
for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes.<br> 
The current version is the 7th edition 2004, which can be downloaded from
www.nhmrc.gov.au/publications/_files/eal6.pdf.<br> 
The Code defines an animal for the purposes of use in teaching as "any live non-human vertebrate, that is, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals, encompassing domestic animals, purpose-bred animals, livestock, wildlife, and also cephalopods such as octopus and squid".<br> 
 National codes of practice are available for most livestock industries, 
 and outline acceptable standards of husbandry and management.<br> 
 There are also Model Codes of Practice covering areas such as transporting
 livestock, sale yards and abattoirs.<br> 
 In Queensland, the national livestock codes are used as the minimum standard.<br> 
 These Model Codes of Practice are available from the CSIRO website: www.csiro.au.<br> 
 If you intend to use animals for scientific purposes (which includes teaching), 
in order to comply with the Act:<br>
 1. you (or your employing institution) must register with the PDF and 
nominate the Animal Ethics Committee (AEC) that will assess your 
 animal use<br>
 2. you must ensure all animal use is approved by the AEC before the activity,<br>
 3. you must provide an annual report to the PDF of activities where animals
are used.<br> 
 An employer may register with the PDF as a "user of animals for scientific
 purposes" to cover employee activities requiring the use of 
 animals for scientific purposes.<br> 
 An animal ethics application must be made to the AEC for each "use of
animals" or "type of use of animals" for a series of similar events.<br> 
 AECs may approve activities that are frequently repeated in a school program.<br> 
 Approval can be sought for a three year period, but activities must be 
reported annually to the AEC.<br> 
 The Queensland Schools Animal Ethics Committee (QSAEC) is required to 
meet and assess written applications for every educational 
 activity that involves using animals for scientific purposes in Queensland
 schools.<br> 
 The QSAEC is a cross sector committee linking Education Queensland, Queensland
Catholic Education Commission and Independent 
 Schools Queensland, and includes members drawn from the scientific and 
wider community to bring a diversity of knowledge, values 
 and beliefs to the committee.<br> 
 Animals must not be used for scientific purposes in any Queensland school 
 without written approval from the QSAEC.<br> 
 The QSAEC meets once a term - usually during the third week of each term.<br> 
 There are at least four meetings of the QSAEC each year.<br> 
 The main task of the members of the Queensland Schools Animal Ethics Committee
is to weigh up the benefits and costs of using 
 animals in schools.<br> 
 The QSAEC members decide whether the proposed activities have justified 
 the use of animals and that the welfare of those animals has 
 been considered.<br>

 Employing authorities are currently considering ways they can support 
schools to comply with requirements.<br> 
 You should check with your employing authority for the details of any 
guidelines or processes in place to assist you to meet the 
 requirements of the legislation.<br>

 The State of Queensland (Queensland Studies Authority) 2004, Amended 2006<br>
 Teachers and scientific investigators in Queensland schools that use animals:<br>
 * Are directly responsible for the welfare of the animals in their care.<br> 
 * Must submit applications to the Queensland Schools Animal Ethics Committee 
 (QSAEC) and have those applications approved 
 before any animal-use activities can be undertaken in their school.<br> 
 * Must apply to the QSAEC for any variation/s to the approved EQ applications 
 and gain QSAEC approval for this variation prior to 
 undertaking the animal-use activity.<br> 
 * Must comply with the Animal Care and Protection Act 2001, the Australian
 code of practice for the care and use of animals for 
 scientific purposes, 7th Edition 2004, and any requirements requested by
the QSAEC.<br> 
 * Must ensure appropriate animals in minimal numbers are used.<br> 
 * Must ensure that pain and stress are minimized.<br> 
 * Are responsible for monitoring and record keeping of the animals on 
their site.<br> 
 * Must report any unexpected adverse events that may occur with any animals
for which they are responsible.<br> 
 What is animal ethics?<br>
 The ethical use of animals for scientific purposes and teaching is a legal
obligation in Australian educational institutions.<br> 
 The use of animals in Queensland schools falls under the Animal Care and
Protection Act 2001 which aims to:<br>
 * provide standards for animal care and use,<br>
 * protect animals from cruelty,<br>
 * safeguard the welfare of animals used for scientific purposes,<br>
 * ensure that the animal use is justified, humane and considerate of animals' needs, and,<br>
 * provide responsible animal care and use.<br> 
 Compliance with the Animal Care and Protection Act 2001 and the Australian
 code of practice for the care and use of animals for 
 scientific purposes, 7th Edition 2004, is a legal obligation of all Queensland educational institutions.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Animal welfare<br>
 Here are some quotes from the Code about Animal Welfare:<br>
 An animal's quality of life based on an assessment of an animal's physical 
 and psychological state as an indication of how the animal is 
 coping with the ongoing situation as well as a judgement about how the 
animal feels.<br> 
 Australian code of practice for the care and use of animals for scientific
 purposes, 7th Edition 2004, p.3.<br> 
 1.16 Animals should be transported, housed, fed, watered, handled and 
used under conditions that meet species-specific needs.<br> 
 The welfare of the animals must be a primary consideration in the provision 
 of care, which should be based on behavioural and 
 biological needs.<br> 
 Australian code of practice for the care and use of animals for scientific
 purposes, 7th Edition 2004, p.6.<br> 
 1.14 Investigators and teachers who use animals for scientific purposes
 have personal responsibility for all matters relating to the welfare 
 of these animals.<br> 
 They have an obligation to treat the animals with respect and to consider 
 their welfare as an essential factor when planning or 
 conducting projects.<br> 
 Australian code of practice for the care and use of animals for scientific
 purposes, 7th Edition 2004, p.5.<br> 
 3.1.1 Investigators and teachers have personal responsibility for all 
matters related to the welfare of the animals they use and must act 
 in accordance with all requirements of the Code.<br> 
 This responsibility begins when an animal is allocated to a project and
ends with its fate at the completion of the project.<br> 
 Australian code of practice for the care and use of animals for scientific
 purposes, 7th Edition 2004, p. 21.<br> 
 The general principles of using animals in education are: Seek alternatives
 to using animals whenever and wherever possible.<br> 
 Students are encouraged and provided with opportunities to discuss ethical, 
 social and scientific issues that relate to the use of animals 
 in both educational and agricultural systems.<br> 
 Whenever and wherever possible encourage the use of non-animal models 
to achieve educational outcomes.<br> 
 Vocational training aspects that involve procedures that cause adverse 
impacts on animals that students carry out must be justified to 
 the QSAEC.<br>

 The purpose of the Australian code for the care and use of animals for 
scientific purposes 8th edition 2013 (the Code) is to promote 
 the ethical, humane and responsible care and use of animals used for scientific
purposes.<br> 
The ethical framework and governing principles set out in the Code provide guidance for investigators, teachers, institutions, animal ethics committees and all people involved in the care and use of animals for scientific purposes.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Synopsis<br>
 The Code encompasses all aspects of the care and use of animals for scientific
purposes where the aim is to acquire, develop or 
 demonstrate knowledge or techniques in any area of science, for example, 
 medicine, biology, agriculture, veterinary and other animal 
 sciences, industry and teaching.<br> 
 It includes their use in research, teaching associated with an educational
 outcome in science, field trials, product testing, diagnosis, the 
 production of biological products and environmental studies.<br> 
 The Code provides an ethical framework and governing principles to guide 
 the decisions and actions of all those involved in the care 
 and use of animals.<br> 
 It details the responsibilities of investigators, animal carers, institutions, 
 and animal ethics committees, and describes processes for 
 accountability.<br> 
 The Code applies to the care and use of all live non-human vertebrates
 and cephalopods.<br> 
 It applies throughout the animal's involvement in activities and projects, 
 including acquisition, transport, breeding, housing, husbandry, 
 the use of the animal in a project, and the provisions for the animal 
at the completion of their use.<br> 
 The Code is endorsed by the National Health and Medical Research Council 
 (NHMRC), the Australian Research Council, the 
 Commonwealth Scientific Industrial Research Organization and Universities
 Australia.<br> 
 It replaces the Australian code of practice for the care and use of animals 
 for scientific purposes, 7th edition 2004.<br> 
 Compliance with the Code is a prerequisite for receipt of NHMRC funding.
 NHMRC expects Administering Institutions to be working 
 towards compliance with the 8th edition of the Code following its release 
 on 24th July 2013.<br> 
 From 1 January 2014, the NHMRC Funding Agreement will reflect the need 
for compliance with the 8th edition of the Code.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="22.0H">22.0</a> Five challenges for science 
 in Australian primary schools<br>
 By Dr Rachel Wilson and Simon Crook, first published in The Conversation, 
 4 June 2015<br>
 Science education has been in the spotlight after federal Education Minister
Christopher Pyne recently proposed to make science 
 and maths education compulsory through to year 12.<br> 
 While this is welcome news, such a proposal needs to include long-term
 plans for improving the status of science in primary 
 schools and ensuring teachers have the requisite support.<br> 
 Here we outline some of the challenges faced as the new science curriculum
 is implemented across the country.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">1. The Australian curriculum is not a 'national 
 curriculum'<br>
 Many people in education are somewhat bemused that the Australian Curriculum, 
 Assessment and Reporting Authority's 
 Australian Curriculum is not national.<br> 
 Every state and territory is implementing the curriculum in their own 
way.<br> 
 This is most noticeable in NSW.<br> 
 Primary school teachers have to follow the NSW syllabus, which combines 
 an additional "technology" component along with 
 science.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">2. Primary Connections: one size does not fit all<br>
 Primary Connections is a program developed to support the teaching of the Australian science curriculum.<br> 
 It has been overtly promoted and endorsed by the Australian Academy of Science plus the science panel on Q&amp;A in 2014, which 
 included Chief Scientist Ian Chubb, Professor Suzanne Cory and Nobel Laureate Professor Brian Schmidt.<br> 
 Primary Connections does provide a wealth of ideas, activities, background knowledge and safety considerations.<br> 
 However, it also has several issues.<br> 
 While Primary Connections is free to all schools via the online platform Scootle, many schools are still spending money to get it via 
 the Primary Connections website, to which the Australian Academy of Science website points all those interested.<br> 
 Primary Connections is essentially just a bunch of PDFs, which is a long way from an inspiring instructive for teachers to get kids 
 interested in science.<br> 
 Many schools are also implementing Primary Connections in its entirety, which might not be consistent with their state or territory 
 requirements.<br> 
 This will not allow for a personalised journey into scientific inquiry.<br> 
 In some Australian states, relying solely on Primary Connections would make a school non-compliant with the requirements of the state 
 syllabus.<br> 
 For example, Primary Connections does not cater for the technology knowledge and skills in the NSW syllabus.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">3. Science is a high-anxiety, low-confidence subject 
 for many primary teachers<br>
 As a primary school teacher once told us, "primary teachers are expert
 generalists".<br> 
 Most lack the training and experience to teach science, and a deep understanding
of the subject and experimentation.<br> 
 Many feel under-confident in science.<br> 
 The declines in science participation are longstanding and will have fed
into the teaching profession.<br> 
 So, increasingly, teachers will not have studied science at upper secondary
 school or university.<br> 
 Only around 50 percent of teachers teaching science in 2013 had received
 training in teaching methods for science.<br> 
 There are also issues in secondary schools.<br> 
 One in five teachers in science classes teaches out of their area of specialisation.<br> 
 The introduction of the new curriculum adds to the challenges teachers
 face.<br> 
 It may lead some to cling onto any resource they find - even if it does
not cover all of the curriculum needs.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">4. Time demands on primary schools<br>
 When primary teachers face disruptions due to impromptu assemblies, excursions
(reported as causing serious disruption in 
 Australian schools in particular) and extra-curricular activities, they
have to choose what to chop from their teaching.<br> 
 This has been demonstrated to impact most on subjects that the teachers 
 themselves are least comfortable with.<br> 
 This is traditionally mathematics, where teachers are under-confident 
and often have limited content knowledge.<br> 
 While mathematics is assessed in NAPLAN, there is currently no comprehensive
 national assessment of science.<br> 
 Thus, despite (or perhaps because of) the new emphasis on science, science
is at risk of being the new sacrificial lamb of choice.<br> 
 NSW mandates that six-10 percent of curriculum time is spent on science 
 in primary schools - that's 1.5 to 2.5 hours a week.<br> 
 There is substantial variation in the time devoted to science across states
and schools.<br> 
 Many schools are operating on only one hour a week, which could easily
 become 45 minutes when you factor in "pack-up time" 
 at the end of the day and other interruptions.<br>
