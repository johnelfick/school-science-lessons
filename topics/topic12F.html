Sulfuric acid 6 M, Dilute 168 mL of 17.8 M acid to 1 litre of water (95%sulfuric acid).<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.16.0H">12.16.0</a> Sulfuric acid<br>
Sulfuric acid, 1.7-7.8 M (15-95% wt/wt) should be handled only by an experieced teacher or a teacher with a high rate training code.<br>
Teachers who handles it must ensure that they identify, assess and control all the risks.<br>
Sulfuric acid, H2SO4, oleum, fuming sulfuric acid, vitriol or oil of vitriol is concentrated H2SO4, clear, colourless, heavy oily liquid, very hygroscopic, conc. 18 M, r.d. about 1.84, 18 mol per mL, 
r.d. fuming H2SO4: 1.92 gm cm<sup>-3</sup> (for accumulators), battery acid, r.d. 1.25 gm cm<sup>-3</sup>, E513, dilute H2SO4, 3 M, store in cool place.<br>
Pure sulfuric acid is called concentrated sulfuric acid.<br>
 Sulfuric acid reacts violently with water to form hydrated hydrogen ions and hydrated sulfate ions.<br>
 So the concept of dilution with water is inappropriate for the concentrated acid, because a vigorous chemical reaction occurs that releases much heat.<br>
 Do not add water to concentrated sulfuric acid.<br>
 Dilute sulfuric acid by adding the acid slowly to water with continuous stirring.<br>
 Wear eye protection when handling concentrated sulfuric acid.<br>
 Water is less dense than sulfuric acid and will layer itself on top of the acid.<br>
 At the acid / water interface, heat is generated by reaction of acid with water.<br>
 This causes the water just above the interface to become very hot.<br>
When a suitable nucleating particle or surface is found, a large steam bubble forms, the middle section of the container boils suddenly and hot acid / water mixture is ejected from the container, often travelling several metres and causing serious chemical burns.<br>
 If, the acid is slowly poured into water with stirring, the same amount of heat is liberated, but the boiling point of the solution is much 
 higher than 100<sup>o</sup>C, because of the presence of the sulfuric acid.<br>
 The temperature of the solution may rise to 150<sup>o</sup>C, but boiling still does not occur.<br>
 Sulfuric acid is highly corrosive to the skin and eyes.<br>
 Wash sulfuric acid off the skin immediately with a large volume of water.<br>
 A small amount of water simply brings about the acid water reaction and liberation of a great amount of heat, causing the remaining sulfuric acid to be even more corrosive.<br>
 Hot sulfuric acid is a strong dehydrating agent and will cause organic materials, e.g. skin, to turn black, because of the removal of water, leaving a residue of carbon.<br>
 Sulfuric acid is not volatile, so neither the pure acid nor its solutions release vapour.<br>
 However, strong heating of the acid may cause decomposition and boiling to form an aerosol of sulfuric acid droplets and sulfur dioxide gas that must not be inhaled.<br>
 Sulfuric acid forms a spontaneously explosive mixture with potassium permanganate to form liquid manganese heptoxide.<br>
 Similarly, sulfuric acid forms a spontaneously explosive mixture with chlorate salts where gaseous chlorine dioxide forms.<br>
 Dilute sulfuric acid solutions are far less dangerous than the concentrated acid, because they do not dehydrate or reducing materials and do not form much heat when further diluted.<br>
 Use sulfuric acid from motor car batteries if it is first diluted with water to four times its volume (Remember: acid to water!), but sulfuric acid collected from lead-acid batteries will be contaminated with lead.<br>
 Poisonous and corrosive if left on clothes.<br>
 In many experiments, a solution of sodium hydrogen sulfate (sodium bisulfate), can be used instead of sulfuric acid.<br>
 Sulfuric acid dissolves most metals, but not copper.<br>
 dissolves metal oxides, including copper oxide, is neutralized by alkalis, e.g. ammonia solution and forms carbon dioxide gas from metal carbonates and bicarbonates.<br>
 Sulfuric acid was formerly manufactured by heating iron (II) sulfate crystals, so it was called "oil of vitriol", a name that is still used for it today.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.18.5.7H">12.18.5.7</a> Sulfuric acid, ionization of hydrogen sulfate ion<br>
<a href="./images/12.6.0.gif">See diagram: 12.6.0</a>: Burn sulfur<br>
Sulfuric acid ionizes to form hydronium ions, H3O<sup>+</sup>, and hydrogen sulfate (bisulfate) ions, HSO4.<br>
Sulfuric acid is a colourless oily liquid available as:<br>
A. 2.0 M (4.0 N) 1.0 M (2.0 N) and 0.5 M (1.0 N) volumetric solutions<br>
B. Minimum assay 97% solution density 1.83 g cm<sup>-3</sup> 3. 98% "ANALAR"solution<br>
C. "Battery acid" solution for lead cell accumulators minimum assay 30%density 1.25 g cm<sup>-3</sup> at 20<sup>o</sup>C (battery acid).<br>
Sulfuric acid is a strong dibasic acid that forms sulfates and hydrogen sulfates a strong oxidizing agent that dissolves copper and a strong dehydrates agent that can remove water from organic compounds.<br>
Sulfuric acid is made by the contact process.<br>
Sulfur is burned or the ores zinc sulfide or iron sulfide (pyrites), are heated to form sulfur dioxide.<br>
The gases pass over vanadium (V) oxide or platinum catalyst at 450<sup>o</sup>C to form sulfur trioxide that combines with water to form sulfuric acid.<br>
Sulfur trioxide is produced by the action of oxygen on sulfur dioxide in the presence of a catalyst, e.g. iron oxide.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.6.0.1H">12.6.0.1</a> Acid rain, SOx, from burning sulfur or sulfur compounds<br>
When coal is burnt, the compounds that contain sulfur can form sulfuric acid, as in the equations below, to become components of acid rain (rainwater pH = 5.6, acid rain pH &lt; 5).<br>
There may be more than one pathway for the formation of sulfuric acid from sulfur dioxide.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.6.3H">12.6.3</a> Concentrated sulfuric acid dehydrates sucrose<br>
This favourite experiment forms a large quantity of toxic gases, e.g. carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide, and the voluminous char, (remaining carbon and other substances), should be washed thoroughly with water to remove any remaining acid before handling.<br>
Experiments<br>
1. Heat a mixture of 0.5 cm of sucrose and 1.0 cm of concentrated sulfuric acid gently for 2 seconds and then leave to stand.<br>
Note the vigorous reaction and the colour change from white sugar to black carbon.<br>
C12H22O11 (s) (H2SO4 catalyst) --> 12C (s) + 11H2O (l)<br>
Students are very interested in this experiment if the sugar is in the shape of a volcano in a deep beaker and the sulfuric acid is poured into the "crater " of the "volcano".<br>
This experiment may be sold as a toy product.<br>
2. Add 35 mL of sulfuric acid to 50 g of sugar in a 100 mL beaker placed on a heat resistant mat.<br>
3. Add 10 mL of sulfuric acid to a large test-tube almost filled with sugar.<br>
The sugar is dehydrated to form carbon and steam, which causes the material to expand, forming a black porous column that rises out of the beaker or test-tube.<br>
Do the experiment in a fume cupboard, because foul smelling vapours are also released.<br>
To remove remaining acid, cool and wash the product thoroughly with water before touching it.<br>
4. Put some sucrose (cane sugar) in a tall beaker.<br>
Add drops of concentrated acid to the sugar.<br>
<b>BE CAREFUL!</b><br>
The sugar turns yellow then brown then black and rises in the beaker.<br>
It reacts with carbohydrates like sugar and cellulose charring them by removing the elements of water from them and leaving a mass of black carbon behind.<br>
5. Roll paper into a tube and hold it in the middle of a soft plastic container, e.g. ice cream tub.<br>
Do not use a glass jar.<br>
Fill the container with sugar.<br>
Pour just enough water to dampen the sugar down the tube to reach the bottom.<br>
Leave to stand for five minutes to allow the water to spread throughout the sugar.<br>
Remove the paper tube to leave a hole in the damp sugar.<br>
<b>BE CAREFUL!</b><br>
Pour 30 mL of concentrated (98%) sulfuric acid down the hole and onto the top of the sugar.<br>
The sugar starts to turn brown, and black in patches.<br>
After some minutes bubbles of steam form.<br>
The reaction became more vigorous as the material in the container expands.<br>
A black cylinder rises out of the jar.<br>
Jets of steam spurt out.<br>
Heat is given out as the cylinder keeps rising.<br>
The black steaming cylinder is spongy carbon.<br>
Tap with a spatula to show it is hard, like expanded polystyrene packaging.<br>
If the carbon solidifies to make a seal over the top of the jar and the reaction continues deeper, below the seal, pressure may build up to cause an explosion and a shower of black crumbling carbon.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.6.4H">12.6.4</a> Concentrated sulfuric acid dehydrates filter paper<br>
Place a piece of dry filter paper top of a beaker.<br>
Put 3 drops of concentrated sulfuric acid on the centre of the filter paper.<br>
Note how the centre of the filter paper chars, becomes black, as the concentrated sulfuric acid withdraws water from the filter paper fibres leaving carbon.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.2.4H">12.2.4</a> Prepare sulfuric acid with iron (II) sulfate<br>
 An early method of preparing vitriol (sulfuric acid), used for bleaching, was by dry distillation of green vitriol (ferrous sulfate, iron (II) sulfate).<br>
 Put 2 cm of powdered iron (II) sulfate crystals into a hard glass test-tube.<br>
 Fit it with a stopper through which passes a right angle piece of glass tubing.<br>
 The other end of the tubing dips into a test-tube.<br>
 Clamp the hard glass test-tube loosely in a stand or hold it in a paper holder.<br>
 Keep the test-tube sloping downward or moisture condenses in the cooler part of the test-tube, runs back on to the hot glass, and cracks the test-tube.<br>
 Heat gently at first, moving the flame, then more strongly.<br>
 Water of crystallization is produced at first and the substance changes to white anhydrous iron (II) sulfate, that decomposes with stronger heat.<br>
 A thick white vapour appears and condenses in the test-tube as a colourless liquid.<br>
 When no more vapour is produced, let the apparatus cool.<br>
 The liquid collected in the test-tube is a weak solution of sulfuric acid.<br>
 Test it with blue litmus paper and a crystal of sodium carbonate (washing soda).<br>
 Carbon dioxide gas forms.<br>
 The red substance left in the hard glass test-tube is red iron oxide, called jewellers' rouge, because jewellers use it for polishing gold and silver.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.11.1H">12.11.1</a> Reactions of nitrites<br>
Use a fume cupboard for these experiments.<br>
The oxide N2O3 is unstable at temperatures above 
-21<sup>o</sup>C and decomposes into nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide.<br>
N2O3 --> NO + NO2.<br>
1. Add dilute hydrochloric acid to sodium nitrite solution.<br>
Note the solution turns pale blue with effervescence and brown fumes are given off.<br>
Acids react with nitrites to produce unstable nitrous acid that decomposes into nitric oxide and oxygen.<br>
The oxygen oxidizes nitrous acid to nitric acid.<br>
3NO3<sup>-</sup> + 2H<sup> +</sup> --> NO3<sup>-</sup> + H2O + 2NO<br>
Finally, the nitric oxide finally reacts with the oxygen of the air to form nitrogen dioxide<br>
2NO + O2 --> 2NO2.<br>
2. Mix iron (II) sulfate solution and sodium nitrite solution.<br>
Add drops of dilute sulfuric acid.<br>
The solution turns brown, because of the loose compound that iron (II) 
 sulfate makes with nitric oxide.<br>
This test distinguishes between a nitrite and a nitrate.<br>
3. Add drops of concentrated hydrochloric acid to two mL of potassium iodide solution.<br>
Pour the mixture into sodium nitrite solution.<br>
Iodine forms as a brown colour or a black precipitate, because of the
oxidation of potassium iodide to iodine.<br>
Iodide ion is oxidized by electron loss and nitrous acid is reduced by electron gain.<br>
2I<sup>-</sup> - 2e- --> I2<br>
2HNO3 + 2H<sup> +</sup> + 2e<sup>-</sup> --> 2H2O + 2NO<br>
2HNO3 + 2H<sup> +</sup> + 2I<sup>-</sup> --> 2H2O + I2 + 2NO<br>
Finally, the nitric oxide finally reacts with the oxygen of the air to form nitrogen dioxide<br>
2NO + O2 --> 2NO2<br>
The nitrous acid acts as an oxidizing agent.<br>
2NO<sup>2-</sup> + 4H<sup> +</sup> + 2e<sup>-</sup> --> 2H2O + 2NO (electron gain).<br>
4. Pass hydrogen sulfide into sodium nitrite solution acidified with dilute hydrochloric acid.<br>
Note the rapid reaction, the precipitate of sulfur and the brown fumes.<br>
Sulfide ions from the partially ionized hydrogen sulfide lose electrons and are oxidized.<br>
Nitrite ions accept these electrons and are reduced.<br>
S<sup>2-</sup> - 2e<sup>-</sup> --> S<br>
2NO2<sup>-</sup> + 4H<sup> +</sup> + 2e<sup>-</sup> --> 2H2O + 2NO<br>
2NO2<sup>-</sup> + 4H<sup> +</sup> + S<sup>2-</sup> --> 2H2O + 2NO + S<br>
The nitrous acid acts as an oxidizing agent.<br>
2NO<sup>2-</sup> + 4H<sup> +</sup> + 2e<sup>-</sup> --> 2H2O + 2NO (electron gain).<br>
5. Add a piece of copper to sodium nitrite solution acidified with dilute sulfuric acid.<br>
Note the rapid reaction to attack the copper and the solution turns blue.<br>
The nitrous acid acts as an oxidizing agent.<br>
2NO<sup>2-</sup> + 4H<sup> +</sup> + 2e<sup>-</sup> --> 2H2O + 2NO (electron gain).<br>
6. Add sodium nitrite solution to bromine water acidified with dilute sulfuric acid.<br>
The bromine water loses its colour, because of reduction to hydrobromic acid.<br>
The bromine is reduced to bromide ions by accepting electrons, the nitrite ion is oxidized and so acts as a reducing agent by supplying the electrons.<br>
Br2 + 2e<sup>-</sup> --> 2Br<sup>-</sup><br>
NO2<sup>-</sup> + H2O --> NO<sup>3-</sup>+ 2H<sup>+ </sup>+ 2e<sup>-</sup><br>
NO2<sup>-</sup> + H2O + Br2 --> 
 NO3<sup>-</sup>+ 2H<sup> +</sup> + 2Br<sup>-</sup><br>
The nitrous acid acts as a reducing agent and is oxidized to nitric acid.<br>
No gas is given off.<br>
If the free nitrous acid is in excess, it will decompose into nitric acid and oxygen.<br>
H2O + NO2<sup>-</sup> --> NO3<sup>-</sup> + 2H<sup>+ </sup>+ 2e<sup>-</sup> (electron loss)<br>
If the free nitrous acid is in excess, decomposition occurs.<br>
7. Add sodium nitrite solution to potassium permanganate solution acidified with dilute sulfuric acid.<br>
The solution loses its colour.<br>
The permanganate ion oxidizes and the nitrite ion reduces and is itself oxidized.<br>
MnO4<sup>-</sup> + 8H<sup>+</sup> + 5e<sup>-</sup> --> Mn<sup>2+</sup> + 4H2O (electron gain)<br>
H2O + NO2<sup>-</sup> - 2e<sup>-</sup> --> NO3<sup>-</sup>+ 2H<sup>+</sup> (electron loss)<br>
5NO<sup>3-</sup> + 2MnO4<sup>-</sup> + 6H<sup>+</sup> --> 5NO3<sup>- </sup>+ 2Mn<sup>2+</sup> + 3H2O<br>
The nitrous acid acts as a reducing agent and is oxidized to nitric acid.<br>
No gas is given off.<br>
If the free nitrous acid is in excess, it will decompose into nitricacid and oxygen.<br>
H2O + NO2<sup>-</sup> --> NO3<sup>-</sup> + 2H<sup>+ </sup>+ 2e<sup>-</sup> (electron loss)<br>
If the free nitrous acid is in excess, decomposition occurs.<br>
8. Add ammonium chloride solution to sodium nitrite solution.<br>
Heat the solution and observe the effervescence and the colourless odourless gas given off.<br>
The gas gives negative results for the limewater test, litmus test, and lighted splint test.<br>
The gas is nitrogen.<br>
NH4<sup>+</sup> + NO2<sup>-</sup> --> 2H2O + N2 (g).<br>
9. Nitrosamines, produced by nitrous acid with secondary
amines, can be formed in the gut when nitrites react with amino acids.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.11.2.0H">12.11.2.0</a> Reactions of nitrates<br>
The oxide N2O5 is unstable above 0<sup>o</sup>C and forms nitrogen dioxide.<br>
1. Add concentrated sulfuric acid to sodium nitrate and heat gently.<br>
<b>Be careful!</b> Nitric acid vapours form with some decomposition causing brown fumes of nitrogen dioxide.<br>
The nitric acid condenses as oily drops on the cooler parts of the test-tube.<br>
NaNO3 + H2SO4 --> NaHSO4 + HNO3<br>
4HNO3 --> 2H2O + 4NO2 + O2.<br>
2. Add three small pieces of copper to sodium nitrate solution and just cover with concentrated sulfuric acid.<br>
(Be careful!) Heat gently the mixture slowly until brown fumes of nitrogen dioxide form.<br>
Cu + 2NaNO3 + 3H2SO4 --> 2NaHSO4 + CuSO4 + 2H2O + 2NO2 (g).<br>

Add sodium nitrate and shake the mixture again until all dissolves.<br>
Pour concentrated sulfuric acid carefully down the side of the test-tube to form a 1 cm deep layer under colloidal iron (II) sulfate solution.<br>
Note the brown ring at the junction of the two liquids.<br>

A tautomer is when an atom, e.g. hydrogen, moves backwards and forwards between different places on a molecule, the new and original molecules form a tautomeric pair.<br>
(H3NSO3) (tautomer: NH2.SO2OH) (amidosulfonic acid, amidosulfuric acid, aminosulfonic acid, sulfamidic acid)<br>
Sulfamic acid is used in preparations to clean stainless steel and copper utensils to remove hard water scale.<br>
It is also used to make sweeteners.<br>
1. Dissolve 1 cc of sulfamic acid in 2 cm of water.<br>
Note the high solubility of the acid.<br>
Tests for sulfate ion by adding dilute hydrochloric acid and drops of barium chloride solution.<br>
At first there is little action, but leave to stand and white suspension of barium sulfate forms.<br>
Boil the mixture and the barium sulfate becomes more apparent as the sulfamic acid hydrolyses.<br>

Note the vigorous effervescence as nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide and nitrogen are given off.<br>
Sulfamic acid is a strong fully ionized acid that reacts with the nitrites to give oxides of nitrogen and its -NH2 group.<br>
Sulfamic acid also reacts with the nitrite to give nitrogen.<br>

Acidify the remaining solution with hydrochloric acid and add barium chloride solution to tests for sulfate ion.<br>
5. Sulfamic acid solution in water is unstable and forms ammonium bisulfate.<br>
However, the colourless crystalline solid is stable, not hygroscopic, and is very soluble in water to form the zwitterion (H3N<sup>+</sup>SO3<sup>-</sup>).<br>
