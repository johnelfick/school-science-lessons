Sulfuric acid, 1.7-7.8 M (15-95% wt/wt) should be handled only by an experieced teacher or a teacher with a high rate training code.<br>
Teachers who handles it must ensure that they identify, assess and control all the risks.<br>
Sulfuric acid, H2SO4, oleum, fuming sulfuric acid, vitriol or oil of vitriol is concentrated H2SO4, is a clear, colourless, heavy oily liquid, very hygroscopic.<br>
| Conc. 18 M, RD. about 1.84, 18 mol per mL | RD fuming H2SO4: 1.92 gm cm-3 | (for accumulators), battery acid, RD. 1.25 gm cm-3 |
 E513 | dilute H2SO4, 3 M | store in cool place.<br>
Pure sulfuric acid is called concentrated sulfuric acid.<br>
 Sulfuric acid is highly corrosive to the skin and eyes.<br>
 Wash sulfuric acid off the skin immediately with a large volume of water.<br>
 A small amount of water simply brings about the acid water reaction and liberation of a great amount of heat, causing the remaining sulfuric acid to be even more corrosive.<br>
 Hot sulfuric acid is a strong dehydrating agent and will cause organic materials, e.g. skin, to turn black, because of the removal of water, leaving a residue of carbon.<br>
 Sulfuric acid is not volatile, so neither the pure acid nor its solutions release vapour.<br>
 However, strong heating of the acid may cause decomposition and boiling to form an aerosol of sulfuric acid droplets and sulfur dioxide gas that must not be inhaled.<br>
 Sulfuric acid forms a spontaneously explosive mixture with potassium permanganate to form liquid manganese heptoxide.<br>
 Similarly, sulfuric acid forms a spontaneously explosive mixture with chlorate salts where gaseous chlorine dioxide forms.<br>
 Dilute sulfuric acid solutions are far less dangerous than the concentrated acid, because they do not dehydrate or reducing materials and do not form much heat when further diluted.<br>
 Use sulfuric acid from motor car batteries if it is first diluted with water to four times its volume (Remember: acid to water!), but sulfuric acid collected from lead-acid batteries will be contaminated with lead.<br>
 Poisonous and corrosive if left on clothes.<br>
 In many experiments, a solution of sodium hydrogen sulfate (sodium bisulfate), can be used instead of sulfuric acid.<br>
 Sulfuric acid dissolves most metals, but not copper.<br>
 Sulfuric acid dissolves metal oxides, including copper oxide, is neutralized by alkalis, e.g. ammonia solution and forms carbon dioxide gas from metal carbonates and bicarbonates.<br>
 Sulfuric acid was formerly manufactured by heating iron (II) sulfate crystals, so it was called "oil of vitriol", a name that is still used for it today.<br>
Different forms of sulfuric acid<br>
Sulfuric acid, pure, concentrated, 0.5 M, 1 M, 2 M, analytical reagent, hygroscopic, Harmful, Corrosive<br>
Sulfuric acid, 98%<br>
Sulfuric acid, concentrated, 18 M, 95%, 110 mL of concentrated solution for 1 litre of 2 M solution.<br>
Sulfuric acid, formerly used with nitre, KNO3, for separating silver from copper<br>
<a name="SulfuricacidfumingH"></a>Sulfuric acid, fuming, "fuming sulfuric acid", oleum, Highly toxic by all routes, Extremely corrosive, use &lt; 20 mL in fume cupboard<br>
Sulfuric acid, fuming, Always very small quantities from a dropper.<br>
Sulfuric acid, concentrated, &gt; 10 M (90%), oil of vitriol<br>
Sulfuric acid, Highly toxic by all routes, highly corrosive to skin, eyes, do not inhale vapour<br>
Sulfuric acid, &lt; 10 M (90%), &gt; 4M (36%), Toxic if ingested, strongly acidic, corrosive<br>
Sulfuric acid, &lt; 4M (36%), &gt; 0.5 M (5%), Strongly acidic, corrosive<br>
Sulfuric acid, &lt; 0.5 M (5%), Not hazardous<br>
Sulfuric acid 2 M, Dilute 112 mL of 35 M in 800 mL water, then add water to 1 litre<br>
Sulfuric acid 6 M, Dilute 168 mL of 17.8 M acid to 1 litre of water (95%sulfuric acid).<br>
Sulfuric acid ionizes to form hydronium ions, H3O+, and hydrogen sulfate (bisulfate) ions, HSO4.<br>
Sulfuric acid is a colourless oily liquid available as:<br>
A. 2.0 M (4.0 N) 1.0 M (2.0 N) and 0.5 M (1.0 N) volumetric solutions<br>
B. Minimum assay 97% solution density 1.83 g cm-3 3. 98% "ANALAR"solution<br>
C. "Battery acid" solution for lead cell accumulators minimum assay 30%, density 1.25 g cm-3 at 20 oC (battery acid).<br>
Battery acid is usually 30-50% sulfuric acid in water, and approximately 0.8 pH.<br>
Sulfuric acid is a strong dibasic acid that forms sulfates and hydrogen sulfates a strong oxidizing agent that dissolves copper 
and a strong dehydrates agent that can remove water from organic compounds.<br>
Sulfuric acid is made by the contact process.<br>
Sulfur is burned or the ores zinc sulfide or iron sulfide (pyrites), are heated to form sulfur dioxide.<br>
The gases pass over vanadium (V) oxide or platinum catalyst at 450 oC to form sulfur trioxide that combines with water to form sulfuric acid.<br>
Sulfur trioxide is produced by the action of oxygen on sulfur dioxide in the presence of a catalyst, e.g. iron oxide.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.6.16H">12.6.16 Sulfuric acid with sucrose<br>
 Concentrated sulfuric acid dehydrates sucrose<br>
This favourite experiment forms a large quantity of toxic gases, e.g. carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide, and the voluminous char, (remaining carbon and other substances), should be washed thoroughly with water to remove any remaining acid before handling.<br>
Experiments<br>
1. Heat a mixture of 0.5 cm of sucrose and 1.0 cm of concentrated sulfuric acid gently for 2 seconds and then leave to stand.<br>
Note the vigorous reaction and the colour change from white sugar to black carbon.<br>
C12H22O11 (s) (H2SO4 catalyst) --> 12C (s) + 11H2O (l)<br>
Students are very interested in this experiment if the sugar is in the shape of a volcano in a deep beaker and the sulfuric acid is poured into the "crater " of the "volcano".<br>
This experiment may be sold as a toy product.<br>
2. Add 35 mL of sulfuric acid to 50 g of sugar in a 100 mL beaker placed on a heat resistant mat.<br>
3. Add 10 mL of sulfuric acid to a large test-tube almost filled with sugar.<br>
The sugar is dehydrated to form carbon and steam, which causes the material to expand, forming a black porous column that rises out of the beaker or test-tube.<br>
Do the experiment in a fume cupboard, because foul smelling vapours are also released.<br>
To remove remaining acid, cool and wash the product thoroughly with water before touching it.<br>
Sulfuric acid acts as a displacer of acids from their salts, sulfuric acid being much less volatile than most other acids.<br>
4. Put some sucrose (cane sugar) in a tall beaker.<br>
Add drops of concentrated acid to the sugar.<br>
<b>BE CAREFUL!</b><br>
The sugar turns yellow then brown then black and rises in the beaker.<br>
It reacts with carbohydrates like sugar and cellulose charring them by removing the elements of water from them and leaving a mass of black carbon behind.<br>
5. Roll paper into a tube and hold it in the middle of a soft plastic container, e.g. ice cream tub.<br>
Do not use a glass jar.<br>
Fill the container with sugar.<br>
Pour just enough water to dampen the sugar down the tube to reach the bottom.<br>
Leave to stand for five minutes to allow the water to spread throughout the sugar.<br>
Remove the paper tube to leave a hole in the damp sugar.<br>
<b>BE CAREFUL!</b><br>
Pour 30 mL of concentrated (98%) sulfuric acid down the hole and onto the top of the sugar.<br>
The sugar starts to turn brown, and black in patches.<br>
After some minutes bubbles of steam form.<br>
The reaction became more vigorous as the material in the container expands.<br>
A black cylinder rises out of the jar.<br>
Jets of steam spurt out.<br>
Heat is given out as the cylinder keeps rising.<br>
The black steaming cylinder is spongy carbon.<br>
Tap with a spatula to show it is hard, like expanded polystyrene packaging.<br>
If the carbon solidifies to make a seal over the top of the jar and the reaction continues deeper, 
below the seal, pressure may build up to cause an explosion and a shower of black crumbling carbon.<br>

Add hot concentrated sulfuric acid to carbohydrates.<br>
The reaction forms carbon dioxide or carbon and water.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.6.18H">12.6.18</a> Sulfuric acid with water<br>
Sulfuric acid, slowly add acid to water with constant vigorous stirring, do <b>NOT</b> add water to acid<br>
Sulfuric acid reacts violently with water to form hydrated hydrogen ions and hydrated sulfate ions.<br>
So the concept of dilution with water is inappropriate for the concentrated acid, because a vigorous chemical reaction occurs that releases much heat.<br>
Do not add water to concentrated sulfuric acid.<br>
Dilute sulfuric acid by adding the acid slowly to water with continuous stirring.<br>
Wear eye protection when handling concentrated sulfuric acid.<br>
Water is less dense than sulfuric acid and will layer itself on top of the acid.<br>
At the acid / water interface, heat is generated by reaction of acid with water.<br>
This causes the water just above the interface to become very hot.<br>
When a suitable nucleating particle or surface is found, a large steam bubble forms
The middle section of the container boils suddenly and hot acid / water mixture is ejected from the container.<br>
The mixture often travelling several metres and causing serious chemical burns.<br>
If, the acid is slowly poured into water with stirring, the same amount of heat is liberated.<br>
However, the boiling point of the solution is much higher than 100 oC, because of the presence of the sulfuric acid.<br>
The temperature of the solution may rise to 150 oC, but boiling still does not occur.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.6.2.2H">12.6.2.2</a> Prepare sulfuric acid with iron (II) sulfate<br>
 An early method of preparing vitriol (sulfuric acid), used for bleaching, was by dry distillation of green vitriol (ferrous sulfate, iron (II) sulfate).<br>
 Put 2 cm of powdered iron (II) sulfate crystals into a hard glass test-tube.<br>
 Fit it with a stopper through which passes a right angle piece of glass tubing.<br>
 The other end of the tubing dips into a test-tube.<br>
 Clamp the hard glass test-tube loosely in a stand or hold it in a paper holder.<br>
 Keep the test-tube sloping downward or moisture condenses in the cooler part of the test-tube, runs back on to the hot glass, and cracks the test-tube.<br>
 Heat gently at first, moving the flame, then more strongly.<br>
 Water of crystallization is produced at first and the substance changes to white anhydrous iron (II) sulfate, that decomposes with stronger heat.<br>
 A thick white vapour appears and condenses in the test-tube as a colourless liquid.<br>
 When no more vapour is produced, let the apparatus cool.<br>
 The liquid collected in the test-tube is a weak solution of sulfuric acid.<br>
 Test it with blue litmus paper and a crystal of sodium carbonate (washing soda).<br>
 Carbon dioxide gas forms.<br>
 The red substance left in the hard glass test-tube is red iron oxide, called jewellers' rouge, because jewellers use it for polishing gold and silver.<br>

Hook a strip of copper over the rim of the ignition tube so that its lower edge is just above the surface of the sulfur.<br>
Heat to boil the sulfur and note the glow as copper sulfide forms on the copper.<br>
2. Pass hydrogen sulfide into copper (II) sulfate solution.<br>
Filter off the precipitated copper (II) sulfide.<br>
Cu2+ + S2- --> CuS (s).<br>
3. This reaction requires the destruction of an ignition tube.<br>
To avoid this loss, some teachers do this experiment on tin lids in the open laboratory, but this practice is not recommended.<br>
Put 2 g of the mixture into a borosilicate test-tube.<br>
Insert a plug of mineral wool into the mouth of the test-tube.<br> 
Clamp the test-tube and heat the powder mixture.<br>
When an orange glow is seen, stop heating the mixture, and leave to cool.<br>
The test tube can be broken open using a pestle and mortar.<br>

4. Prepare sulfides of iron, cobalt and nickel.<br>
Prepare solutions of iron (II) cobalt and nickel salts.<br>
Pass hydrogen sulfide into each solution Note a slight precipitate of dark iron (II) sulfide, but no precipitate with the cobalt or nickel salts.<br>
Add ammonia solution, NH3 (aq) ("ammonium hydroxide") and pass more hydrogen sulfide through the three solutions.<br>
All three solutions form a black precipitate of the metallic sulfide, however only iron (II) sulfide dissolves in dilute hydrochloric acid.<br>
The sulfides of cobalt and nickel dissolve in concentrated hydrochloric acid in the presence of potassium chlorate or in aqua regia.<br>
Transfer the sulfides to evaporating basins, add concentrated hydrochloric acid and a crystal of potassium chlorate.<br>
Heat until the crystals dissolve.<br>
The cobalt salt becomes is pink in solution.<br>
The nickel salt becomes yellow-green.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.6.24H">12.6.24</a> Prepare sulfur monochloride, S2Cl2<br>
This experiment may not be allowed in some school systems.<br>
Put 10 cc of sulfur in a distilling flask.<br>
Use a one-hole stopper fitted with a delivery tube to reach the level of the sulfur.<br>
Connect the delivery tube to a supply of dry chlorine.<br>
Heat the sulfur on a gauze and pass in chlorine.<br>
Stand the flask in a water bath of cold water.<br>
Collect the liquid product of sulfur monochloride, S2Cl2, in a dry test-tube.<br>
Heat drops of the product in water and tests for sulfur dioxide and hydrochloric acid.<br>
Note the deposit of sulfur.<br>
2S2Cl2 + 2H2O --> 4HCl + 3S (s) +SO2 (g).<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.6.25H">12.6.25</a> Reactions of sulfamic acid<br>
Sulfamic acid, NH2.SO2OH<br>
A tautomer is when an atom, e.g. hydrogen, moves backwards and forwards between different places on a molecule, 
the new and original molecules form a tautomeric pair.<br>
(H3NSO3) (tautomer: NH2.SO2OH) (amidosulfonic acid, amidosulfuric acid, aminosulfonic acid, sulfamidic acid)<br>
Sulfamic acid is used in preparations to clean stainless steel and copper utensils to remove hard water scale.<br>
It is also used to make sweeteners.<br>
1. Dissolve 1 cc of sulfamic acid in 2 cm of water.<br>
Note the high solubility of the acid.<br>
Tests for sulfate ion by adding dilute hydrochloric acid and drops of barium chloride solution.<br>
At first there is little action, but leave to stand and white suspension of barium sulfate forms.<br>
Boil the mixture and the barium sulfate becomes more apparent as the sulfamic acid hydrolyses.<br>
NH2.SO2.OH + H2O --> NH4HSO4.<br>
2. Dissolve 1 cc of sulfamic acid in 2 cm of water.<br>
Dissolve 1 cc of sodium nitrite in 2 cm of water.<br>
Mix the solutions.<br>
Note the vigorous effervescence as nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide and nitrogen are given off.<br>
Sulfamic acid is a strong fully ionized acid that reacts with the nitrites to give oxides of nitrogen and its -NH2 group.<br>
Sulfamic acid also reacts with the nitrite to give nitrogen.<br>
2H + + 2HNO2 + 2e- --> 2H2O + 2NO<br>
2NO + O2 --> 2NO2<br>
NH2.SO2.O- + H+ + NO2- --> N2 (g) + HSO4- + H2O<br>
Tests for sulfate ion by adding dilute hydrochloric acid and drops of barium chloride solution.<br>
A white suspension of barium sulfate forms.<br>
3. Add sodium hydroxide solution to 1 mL of sulfamic acid to a depth of 2 cm for an excess of sodium hydroxide.<br>
Heat the solution and test the gas formed for ammonia with damp red litmus paper.<br>
NH2.SO2.O- + 2OH- --> NH3 (g) + SO42- + H2O.<br>
4. Heat 1 cc of sulfamic acid in a dry test-tube.<br>
Tests for sulfur dioxide with a spot of potassium permanganate on a filter paper.<br>
Test for sulfur trioxide by allowing the white fumes to flow into a test-tube containing barium chloride solution acidified with hydrochloric acid.<br>
Note the crystalline sublimate and dissolve the crystals in 2 cm of sodium hydroxide solution.<br>
Heat the solution then tests for ammonia with damp red litmus paper.<br>
Acidify the remaining solution with hydrochloric acid and add barium chloride solution to tests for sulfate ion.<br>
5. Sulfamic acid solution in water is unstable and forms ammonium bisulfate.<br>
However, the colourless crystalline solid is stable, not hygroscopic, and is very soluble in water to form the zwitterion (H3N+SO3-).<br>
On heating, the solution produces ammonia.<br>
6. Sulfamic acid reacts with nitrous acid to form nitrogen<br>
HNO2 + (NH2)HSO3 --> H2SO4 + N2 + H2O.<br>
7. Sulfamic acid reacts with nitric acid to form nitrous oxide<br>
HNO3 + (NH2)HSO3 --> H2SO4 + N2O + H2O.<br>
8. Sodium hydroxide solution is standardized by titration with primary standard sulfamic acid solution<br>
NaOH + (NH2)HSO3 --> NaNH2SO3 + H2O.<br>
9. Add 2 cm of sodium carbonate to 1 cc of zinc powder.<br>
Test for carbon dioxide by passing the gas given off to pass into limewater that turns milky due to the fine precipitate of calcium carbonate.<br>
2H + + CO32- --> H2O +CO2 (g)<br>
Ca(OH)2 + CO2 (g) --> CaCO3 (s) +H2O.<br>

The 1 - 3% "sulfur" in coal is usually iron (II) sulfide (pyrite).<br>
4 FeS2 (s) + 11O2 (g) --> 2Fe2O3 (s) + 8SO2 (g)<br>
S (s) + O2 (g) --> SO2 (g) sulfur dioxide<br>
Also, other sulfide ores may produce sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere during smelting to obtain the pure metal.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.6.22H">12.6.22</a> Prepare sodium carbonate<br>
What was known "alkali", soda ash (sodium carbonate) and potash (potassium carbonate), were vital chemicals in the glass, textile, soap, and paper industries.<br> 
It could be obtained from potash, from wood ashes using the ashes of large northern forests, (Salicornia europoea), or from kelp.<br>
It could also be obtained from Natron, (Na2CO3·10H2O, in dry lake beds.<br> 
The Leblanc process involved two stages:<br>
1. Making sodium sulfate from sodium chloride.<br>
Sodium chloride is mixed with concentrated sulfuric acid and the mixture exposed to low heat.<br> 
The hydrogen chloride gas bubbles off, leaving a fused mass.<br> 
H2SO4 (aq) + NaCl (s) --> HCl (g) + NaHSO4 (s)<br> 
This reaction produces sodium sulfate ("salt cake") and hydrogen chloride.<br>
2NaCl + H2SO4 --> Na2SO4 + 2 HCl.<br>
2. Reacting the sodium sulfate with coal and calcium carbonate to make sodium carbonate.<br>
A mixture of the salt cake and crushed limestone (calcium carbonate) was reduced by heating with coal.<br>
In this carbothermic reaction the coal, as a source of carbon, reduces the sulfate to sulfide.<br>
Na2SO4 + 2 C --> Na2S + 2 CO2<br>
In the second stage, is the reaction to produce sodium carbonate and calcium sulfide, ("black ash).<br>
Na2S + CaCO3 --> Na2CO3 + CaS<br>
The soda ash is extracted from the black ash with water.<br> 
Evaporation of this extract yields solid sodium carbonate.<br>
The noxious calcium sulfide can ve convrrted into calcium carbonate.<br>
CaS (s) + CO2 (g) + H2O (l) --> CaCO3 (s) + H2S (g)<r>
 This mass is heated, then heated with coal, then limestone. then wahed, then carbon dixide bubbed through it, then zinc hydroxe added, all done to remove impurities.<br>
By the 1870s, the British soda output of 200,000 tons annually exceeded that of all other nations in the world combined.<br>
Solvay process<br>
It is a more direct process for producing soda ash from salt and limestone through the use of ammonia.<br> 
The Leblanc process plants were quite damaging to the local environment, because of the gases released leaving and insoluble smelly solid waste, which weatghered to release hydrogen sulfide.<br>
The Leblanc process remained more wasteful and more polluting than the Solvay process.<br>
