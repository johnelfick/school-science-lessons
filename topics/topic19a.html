Aflatoxins are naturally occurring mycotoxins that are produced by many species of Aspergillus, a fungus, most notably Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus.<br>
At least 13 different types of aflatoxin are produced in nature and Aflatoxin B1 is considered the most toxic being produced by both Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus.<br>
The native habitat of Aspergillus is in soil, decaying vegetation, hay, and grains undergoing microbiological deterioration and it invades all types of organic substrates whenever conditions are favourable for its growth.<br>
Favouconditions include high moisture content, (at least 7%) and high temperature.<br>
Aflatoxins B1, (AFB1) are contaminants of improperly stored foods; they are potent genotoxic and carcinogenic compounds, exerting their effects through damage to DNA.<br>
They can also induce mutations that increase oxidative damage.(PMID: 17214555).<br>
Crops affected by Aspergillus contamination include cereals, (maize, sorghum, pearl millet, rice, wheat), oilseeds, (peanut, soybean, sunflower, cotton), spices, (chili peppers, black pepper, coriander, turmeric, ginger), and tree nuts, (almond, pistachio, walnut, coconut, Brazil nut).<br>
Aflatoxin is a naturally occurring toxic product found in moulds in foods, especially peanuts, (groundnuts), and peanut butter, due to lack of proper drying and storage of crops.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.2.2H">19.2.2</a> Bacteria in food, the 2-hour and 4-hour rule<br>
Food that can support the growth of bacteria is called potentially hazardous food and is usually stored in a refrigerator, e.g. meat, dairy products, cooked rice and pasta.<br>
Most pathogen bacteria do not grow or have very slow growth below 5<sup>o</sup>C and above 60<sup>o</sup>C, so their favourable temperature range is 
between these two temperatures.<br>
When most pathogenic bacteria enter the favourable temperature range they remain in a lag phase for about 2 hours before they start to multiply rapidly.<br>
So if food is stored in a refrigerator for some time it is safe to eat the food or return it to the refrigerator for up to 2 hours after removal of the food from the refrigerator.<br>
For up to 4 hours after removal from the refrigerator the food may be consumed, but not returned to the refrigerator.<br>
Food removed from the refrigerator for 4 hours or more must be discarded, because they are a potentially hazardous and because they may cause food poisoning.<br>

After 3 days observe corrosion in the can containing sodium bicarbonate, but not in the can containing vinegar.<br>
The aluminium oxide formed on the surface of the aluminium can is stable in acid solutions, but dissolves in the basic solution leaving the aluminium unprotected.<br>

Blanching, plunging vegetables in boiling water for 2 minutes, inactivates enzymes.<br>
Potatoes cut for potato chips, French fries, boiled for two minutes and then cooled in a refrigerator for a further two minutes do not brown as fast as potatoes that are only cut before cooking.<br>
During preservation by canning, freezing or dehydration, most vegetables are blanched by immersion in steam or hot water.<br>
Blanching inactivates enzymes that otherwise would cause deterioration of the food during storage and subsequent thawing.<br>
Steam blanching results in greater retention of water soluble nutrients than water blanching.<br>
Microwave blanching results in better ascorbic acid retention in Brussels sprout.<br>
Vegetables that have significant loss of vitamin c and thiamine from blanching include spinach, broccoli, green beans, lima beans, Brussels sprout, cauliflower and peas.<br>

by Cindy Meredith, The Herb Cottage, Halletsville, Texas, USA<br>
Cindy@theherbcottage.com<br>
How to preserve herbs<br>
There are several ways to preserve herbs for later use.<br>
Drying may seem like the easiest, but it isn’t always the most effective to maintain the fine taste of culinary herbs.<br>
Freezing herbs is a most effective, easy, and quick method.<br>
If you would like to dry your herbs as a quick way to preserve them, you can hang them in an airy place away from direct sunlight.<br>
Or lay them out on a screen or even use a cookie cooling rack with a towel over it.<br> 
The idea is to get airflow around the herbs.<br>
To make sure the herbs are completely dried, crumble them between your fingers. They should be completely dried and crumble easily.<br>
Then, store them in an air-tight container away from direct sunlight.<br>
If you’re unsure whether or not your herbs are completely dried, just store them in the freezer to alleviate any worry.<br>
For either of the following methods, use just the leaves and soft stems<br>
Woody stems should be discarded and used elsewhere, for example, in tea.<br>
Probably the best method is to freeze herbs in oil.<br>
Use about 2 cups chopped herbs, singly or in combinations, to about 1/2 cup of cooking oil.<br>
Using either a food processor or blender, gradually add the oil to the chopped herbs.<br>
The mixture should be fairly thick.<br>
Pack the herbal oil into small glass or plastic containers or ice cube trays and freeze.<br>
To use, just scrape or chip the amount needed and add to your favorite recipe.<br>
These oils should last up to about 2 years in the freezer.<br>
To freeze herbs in water or stock, chop herbs, either one herb alone or make a combination of your favorites.<br>
Fill the sections of an ice cube tray as full as you can.<br>
Simply pour hot water or stock over them and freeze.<br>
When frozen, remove from the trays and store in plastic bags for later use.<br>
Use the “herb cubes” in soups, stews, sauces or anywhere you would use fresh herbs.<br>

 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.2.7H">19.2.7</a> Lost nutrients in food<br>
Nutrients may be lost during food processing because they react with other constituents of the food, oxygen, light or heat, or because they are leached by water.<br>
Trace elements and enzymes may also catalyse the destruction of the nutrients.<br>
Nutrient loss varies with the type of food, the length of time of processing and the particular nutrient.<br>
Nutrients that are unstable in solution include vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, folic acid, vitamin K, riboflavin, thiamine and essential amino acids threonine and tryptophan.<br>
Nutrients that are unstable in cooking heat include vitamin A, vitamin C, biotin, ( in vitamin B complex), vitamin D, folic acid, vitamin K, riboflavin, thiamine and essential amino acids lysine, threonine<br>and tryptophan.<br>
Canned meats contain less thiamine than fresh cooked meats because some is destroyed by the heat sterilization.<br>
The importance of nutrient losses during processing depends on the total diet.<br>
Where essential dietary components are in limited supply, any loss of nutrients may be important.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.2.8H">19.2.8</a> Nutrients in food<br>
1. Minimize the amount of chopping and cutting of vegetables for cooking by boiling.<br>
2. Do not use sodium bicarbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate, in cooking to make cooked vegetables look greener, because it increases the rate of loss of thiamine and vitamin C.<br>
3. Store foods at the lowest appropriate temperature and for the shortest possible time.<br>
Avoid storing cooked foods for lengthy periods in the freezer or refrigerator.<br>
When you purchase frozen food, carry it home in an insulated container and place it in the home freezer as soon as you get home.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.2.9H">19.2.9</a> Nutritional value of processed food, niacin<br>
The nutritional value of a processed food is rarely better than that of the raw ingredients from which it is produced, unless nutrients are added in purified or concentrated form.<br>
Some beneficial effects of processing include the destruction of trypsin inhibitor in legumes, and the liberation of bound niacin in cereals.<br>
The consumer can judge reduction in nutritional value of food because it is usually accompanied by a reduction in colour, flavour and texture.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.2.10H">19.2.10</a> Pasteurization of milk<br>
<a href="./biology/UNBiol8.html#4.5.5">See 4.5.5</a>: Pasteur's spontaneous generation experiment.<br>
Pasteurization is the heat treatment of milk, usually 71.7<sup>o</sup>C for 15 seconds or 62<sup>o</sup>C for 30 minutes, so that the milk should keep in the 
 refrigerator for about 5 days.<br>
This treatment destroys all pathogenic organisms, e.g. tuberculosis and most other bacteria to reducing the risk of milk borne infection and delay milk becoming sour.<br>
 However, there is some loss of thiamine, (vitamin B), and ascorbic acid, (vitamin C).<br>
 The amounts of nutrients lost from a processed food depend on the temperature experienced, the time that elapses between processing and consumption, the nature of the food and the nature of the container.<br>
 During pasteurization of milk the minerals, vitamin A, vitamin D, pyridoxine, niacin, pantothenic acid and biotin not affected.<br>
 Riboflavin, vitamin E and vitamin K are only slightly affected.<br>
 Thiamine is reduced by 3%.<br>
 The proteins albumin and globulin may be 10% coagulated.<br>
 Vitamin B1 and vitamin C may be greatly affected, but milk is not an important source of these vitamins.<br>
 To produce UHT milk, "long life milk", by "ultra-heat treatment" processing, milk is heated to 140<sup>o</sup>C for about 3 seconds then rapidly cooled to 20<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 Milk in unopened UHT packages can keep for 4 to 6 months.<br>
 Pasteurization can extend the shelf life of beer, wine and other products by killing any remaining yeast.<br>
Experiment<br>
 Compare the spoilage rate of non-pasteurized, pasteurized, and ultra-pasteurized milk at two different temperatures.<br>
 Milk is contaminated by bacteria as leaves the udder, although they are harmless and few in number.<br>
 Processing and handling activities can introduce further microorganisms.<br>
 The two main groups of bacteria in milk are lactic acid bacteria, (LAB), and coliform bacteria.<br>
 Lactic acid bacteria is the normal bacteria present in milk and dairy products.<br>
 Coliform bacteria are the main cause of milk spoilage.<br>
 Observe the changes in the pH of milk over a several day period, (depending on room temperature), as it goes sour.<br>
 Allow the milk to reach room temperature without cooking and re-pasteurizing it.<br>
 Plug the pH probe into the socket and insert the probe into the container of milk.<br>
 Record the data and display the graph.<br>
 Keep the experiment in a stable environment as the extremes in room temperature may give false readings.<br>
 Note any reduction of pH shortly after starting the experiment.<br>
 Note whether the speed of change in pH stay constant over the whole experiment period.<br>
 Repeat the experiment with UHT milk over the same time period.<br>
 Repeat the experiment by keeping the container of milk at different temperatures, (in the fridge or an incubator).<br>
 In the experiment, all types of milk grew more bacteria colonies in warmer temperature, except the ultra-pasteurized milk, which grew no colonies at all.<br>

Sulfur dioxide and sulfites, (E220 to 224), inhibit deterioration of dried fruits and fruit juices.<br>
In the fermentation industry, used to prevent spoilage by microbes, as a selective inhibitor, as an antioxidant and anti-browning agent.<br>
Sulfur dioxide destroys thiamine so it is only allowed in to foods not an important sources of thiamine.<br>
It may be not allowed in meat, except for cooked manufactured meat, e.g. salamis, sausages.<br>
Some people are allergic to sulfur dioxide.<br>

Pyridoxine, ( vitamin B6), folic acid and pantothenic acid are the most vulnerable of the B vitamins in foods of animal origin.<br>
From 50% to 90% of folic acid and pyridoxine, and 10% to 50% of pantothenic acid may be lost during cooking.<br>
Folic acid is said to help reduce the risk of neural tube defects in babies and some foods have been fortified with folic acid to be used by pregnant women.<br>
However, recent research suggests that such fortified food increases the risk of cancer.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.2.16H">19.2.16</a> Water content of food<br>
Food is commonly preserved by decreasing the availability of water in the food to micro-organisms, i.e. by decreasing the water activity.<br>
The water activity of pure water = 1, so any dissolved substances reduces the water activity.<br>
Measure the water activity measuring the equilibrium vapour pressure of the water or by measuring its freezing point or boiling point.<br>
Water activity can be decreased by drying processes or by adding solutes, e.g. sodium chloride, sugar, sodium nitrate.<br>
Lowering of pH also controls micro-organisms.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.3.14H"></a>19.3.14 Bacteria in food, the 2 hour and 4 hour rule<br>
 Hot food stored in a restaurant should be always above 60<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 Cold food stored in a restaurant should always be below 5<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 However, many foods kept on display, e.g. pies or sushi, are not kept at these temperatures, thus bacteria can multiply in them.<br>
 To control bacteria, temperatures should either be very high or very low:<br>
 115<sup>o</sup>C to 120<sup>o</sup>C: Canning temperatures used for low acid vegetables, meat, and poultry in a pressure canner.<br>
 100<sup>o</sup>C to 115<sup>o</sup>C: Canning temperatures used for fruits, tomatoes, and pickles in water bath canner.<br>
 75<sup>o</sup>C to 100<sup>o</sup>C: Cooking temperatures that destroy most bacteria.<br>
 Time needed to kill bacteria decreases as temperature increases.<br>
 60<sup>o</sup>C to 75<sup>o</sup>C: These warming temperatures prevent growth, but allow survival of some bacteria.<br>
 40<sup>o</sup>C to 60<sup>o</sup>C: At these temperatures some bacterial growth may occur and many bacteria survive.<br>
 15<sup>o</sup>C to 40<sup>o</sup>C: These temperatures allow rapid growth of bacteria and production of toxins by some bacteria.<br>
 5<sup>o</sup>C to 15<sup>o</sup>C: At these temperatures some growth of food poisoning bacteria may occur.<br>
 Do not store meats, poultry, or seafood for more than a week in the refrigerator.<br>
 0<sup>o</sup>C to 5<sup>o</sup>C: These cold temperatures permit slow growth of some bacteria that cause spoilage.<br>
 -10<sup>o</sup>C to 0<sup>o</sup>C: These freezing temperatures stop growth of bacteria, but may allow bacteria to survive.<br>
