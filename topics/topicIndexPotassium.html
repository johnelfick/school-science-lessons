Potassium</a>, K (Dutch <i>potasch</i>, <i>potasschen</i> potash) (Latin <i>kalium</i>, K), metal, potassium rod stored in mineral oil,<br>
AAS solution, toxic if ingested or contacts skin<br>
Potassium is a soft and shiny white alkali metal, highest metal in the reactivity series so does not occur in the free state.<br>
Potassium is about 2.5% of the earth's crust, is available in the laboratory as pieces of the metal in liquid paraffin and is used widely in chemistry.<br>
Potassium is the " K" in the common fertilizer NPK, usually as (K2O).<br>
It reacts with dilute HCl or H2SO4 to form H2 and metal ion, reacts with concentrated oxidizing acids, HNO3 or H2SO4 to produce high oxidation number ions,<br>
and sulfur dioxide SO2 or nitrogen dioxide, NO2.<br>
Potassium reacts with cold water and reacts with air to form peroxides.<br>
Potassium has less concentration in extra cellular fluids than in intracellular fluids, where it is the primary cation.<br>
Potassium ions are lost in sweat along with sodium ions.<br>
Potassium metal is banned in many school systems.<br>
Potassium reacts violently with water to form hydrogen gas that may ignite or explode.<br>
Destroy potassium safely with 2-methylpropan-2-ol.<br>
Potassium forms a crust of yellow oxide that may explode when cut.<br>
For school science experiments, use sodium or lithium instead of potassium.<br>

Potassium chromate, (K2CrO4, lemon yellow crystals, MP 975<sup>o</sup>C, alkaline aqueous solution<br>
Potassium chromate, as with other chromium (VI) salts, may be carcinogenic, so handle it with care.<br>
However, when used in dilute solution, near neutral pH, it is relatively safe.<br>
When mixed with acid, chromate ions, CrO4<sup>2-</sup>, first form dichromate ions, Cr2O7<sup>2-</sup>, then chromic acid, H2CrO4.<br>
Solutions containing chromic acid are powerfully oxidizing and highly corrosive.<br>
Do NOT use the cleaning mixture called "chromic acid", prepared by dissolving a metal chromate or dichromate in concentrated sulfuric acid.<br>
This cleaning mixture is NOT permitted in schools, because it is dangerously corrosive to skin and eyes.<br>
It is probably no more effective as a cleaning agent than strong detergent solutions or a suitable solvent.<br>

It was formerly used mixed with sulfuric acid to clean laboratory glassware, but nowadays this procedure NOT permitted in schools.<br>
Oxidation reactions involve the reduction of solutions of chromate or dichromate ions that cause colour changes from yellow or orange to pale green or colourless.<br>
The reactions with the formation of an insoluble metal chromate give brightly coloured precipitates.<br>
Do NOT attempt to isolate these precipitates, because they are carcinogenic.<br>
It is best to prepare these precipitates in the smallest quantities that allow them to be seen.<br>
Do NOT use potassium dichromate solution to colour water for demonstrations.<br>
It is used in machines to breath test for alcohol.<br>

Potassium hydroxide, KOH, solid, flake, pellets, 1 M analytical reagent, caustic potash<br>
Potassium hydroxide, as a solid or concentrated solution is extremely corrosive to the skin and eyes.<br>
Always wear safety glasses when handling potassium hydroxide, even with dilute concentrations.<br>
If potassium hydroxide enters the eye, rinse the eye instantly with water.<br>
Solutions of potassium hydroxide on the skin feel soapy, because fats in the skin are broken down to form anions of fatty acids, e.g. stearate, palmitate and oleate,<br>
which give the solution a slippery feel.<br>
When potassium hydroxide dissolves in water, a large amount of heat is released.<br>
It sometimes causes the solution to boil violently if it has NOT been stirred, so always stir solutions in that potassium hydroxide is dissolving to dissipate heat and<br>
to provide a uniform concentration throughout the solution.<br>
Potassium hydroxide solutions boil at a higher temperature than pure water.<br>

Potassium permanganate is a powerful oxidizing agent that forms dangerously combustible or even explosive mixtures with oxidizable materials, or combustible<br>
materials, e.g. red phosphorus, cyanides thiosulfates acetates, sugar, charcoal, sulfur, phosphorus, ammonium salts, active metal powders, organic compounds.<br>
The solid is also spontaneously flammable on contact with glycerine, ethylene glycol and other organic compounds.<br>
It forms violently explosive manganese heptoxide on mixing with concentrated sulfuric acid.<br>
Oxygen gas is formed on heating the solid, but toxic fine particles of manganese oxides are produced simultaneously, so if the reaction occurs in a test-tube,<br>
place a plug of glass wool in the end of the tube to trap particles.<br>
Do NOT use sulfuric acid for drying oxygen gas from decomposition of potassium permanganate, because the acid could mix with the salt and react explosively.<br>
For preparing oxygen gas, it is safer to use hydrogen peroxide and potassium permanganate, or hydrogen peroxide with manganese dioxide catalyst.<br>
If potassium permanganate is used for preparation of chlorine gas, by reaction with hydrochloric acid, the solid must be is covered with a layer of water and<br>
hydrochloric acid must is used, NOT sulfuric acid.<br>
Acidified solutions are used as an oxidant in organic chemistry for the oxidation of aldehydes or alcohols.<br>
Neutral solutions are used to distinguish between alkanes and alkenes.<br>
Dilute aqueous solutions of potassium permanganate are relatively harmless and have been used medicinally for mouthwashes and bactericides.<br>
Potassium manganate (VII) is NOT a primary standard, so make up an approximate concentration and titrate it against an ethanoic acid solution of known concentration.<br>
Potassium manganate (VII) crystals are so dark it is difficult to see if all have dissolved when making up a solution.<br>
Bottles of potassium manganate (VII) solution may have a brown precipitate around the top of manganese (IV) oxide.<br>
It is formed when manganate (VII) ions react with water in the air.<br>

A more accurate method is by leaching a small quantity of the earth, and boiling to dryness, and weighing the salt.<br>
2. Repeated leaching with water to produce a ley is used to get as strong a solution as possible, and extract most of the nitre.<br>
After the sixth leaching, the earth is considered as sufficiently exhausted.<br>
The leys thus obtained are used upon fresh earth until the solution is of sufficient density to bear an egg when it then contains about a 500 g of salt to 4 litres of liquid.<br>
3. The ley contains, nitrate of potash (nitre, potassium nitrate), nitrate of lime, nitrate of magnesia, sodium chloride and potassium 
 chloride.<br>
To convert all other nitrates into nitrate of potash, add wood ashes.<br>
The potash of the ashes takes all the nitric acid of the other nitrates, forming the nitrate of potash (nitre).<br>
The lime and magnesia are precipitated as an insoluble sediment.<br>
Also, the ashes can be mixed with the nitrified earth and leached together or the saltpetre ley filtered through wood ashes, or the ley of ashes added to the saltpetre ley.<br>
4. Put the ley in a boiler.<br>
The ley still contains common salt (sodium chloride), and other impurities.<br>
However, nitre, is much more soluble than common salt in boiling water, but much less soluble in cold water.<br>
As the boiling proceeds and the solution becomes more concentrated, the common salt is precipitated in small crystals as a sandy sediment to be raked out.<br>
Remove organic matter rising as scum.<br>
Leave the boiler to cool when the concentration has reached almost the point of saturation.<br>
This point is determined by letting fall a drop of the boiling liquid upon a cold metallic surface so that, if it crystallizes quickly, it is time to stop the boiling.<br>
As the ley cools, most of the nitre separates as crystals, which sink to the bottom.<br>
Remove the crystals and return the mother liquor to the boiler, or used in watering the heaps.<br>
The crude saltpetre still contains 15-20% of impurities, mainly sodium chloride, potassium chloride and organic matter.<br>
5. Refining<br>
Starting with saturated solution of nitre, add glue that seizes upon the organic matter and rises as scum to be removed.<br>
Continue the boiling until the liquid is clear, then cooled and constantly stirred until most of the nitre is deposited in very fine, needle-like crystals, called saltpetre flour.<br>
Wash off all adhering mother liquor.<br>
The nitre is now dried by gentle heat and constant stirring, and may be considered quite pure, and fit for the manufacture of gunpowder.<br>
6. Analysis<br>
1. A saturated solution of any salt will not dissolve any more of that salt, but will freely dissolve other salts.<br>
2. Nitre mixed with charcoal and heated is converted into carbonate of potash, but common salt is not affected.<br>
However. if saltpetre is mixed with charcoal alone and then heated the reaction is violent and explosive.<br>
To moderate the violence, the saltpetre is mixed with common salt, which does not interfere with the reaction.<br>
Use one part crude saltpetre, four parts common salt, and one-half part charcoal, heated in an iron spoon, until reaction ceases.<br>
The nitre is now changed into carbonate of potash to be dissolved in water and filtered.<br>
The quantity is estimated by the quantity of sulfuric of known strength necessary to neutralize it completely.<br>
3. A strong hot solution of nitre crystallizes on cooling, and that the temperature at which crystals begin to deposit depends upon how much nitre is in the solution.<br>
In a saturated solution of nitre, one hundred parts by weight of water at 32F contains 13.32 parts of nitre.<br>

Platinum is a soft, ductile transition metal, resists most chemical agents, does not oxidize at high temperature, available as foil and wire.<br>
It occurs in free elemental form placer deposits or in alloys, and is used for electrical contacts electrodes and jewellery.<br>
Platinum has no reaction with dilute HCl or H2SO4, air, water or concentrated oxidizing acids, e.g. HNO3 or H2SO4, reacts with aqua regia, (concentrated HNO3 + HCl) to form H2PtCl6.<br>
Platinum is malleable, ductile and can be cut into slices.<br>
It has a slightly grey lustre.<br>
It is harder than gold and silver, so it is mixed with those metals when making rings and other jewellery.<br>
Platinum vessels can hold acids, because they do not react with them.<br>
Platinum was first used for decorative objects and jewellery settings, but nowadays is used in scientific apparatus, electrical equipment, electrodes and resistance thermometry and many industrial processes as a catalyst.<br>
It has weak magnetism.<br>
Platinum black is used as a catalyst in chemical reactions.<br>
Platinum can absorb hydrogen and is used in catalytic converters to treat exhaust gases of motor vehicles.<br>
The melting point of platinum is 1768<sup>o</sup>C, higher than gold, bronze and iron.<br>
It was used to cast the platinum-iridium cylinder called the International Prototype Kilogram (IPK), in France, because of its high density and resistance to corrosion.<br>

Phosphorescence is the green glow from the slow oxidation of white phosphorus, an example of chemiluminescence.<br>
However, the term phosphorescence is also used to describe a situation when the luminescence persists although the exciting cause has been removed.<br>
A phosphorescent material irradiated with UV light will emit light of a lower energy for an appreciable interval of time.<br>
If a phosphorescent powder is irradiated with another fluorescent material, when the radiation source is removed the phosphorescent powder emits light for tens of seconds.<br>
Marine phosphorescence is not caused by phosphorus, but by chemical reactions in bioluminescent bacteria.<br>
However, rotting herring glows, caused by combustion of rotting products, <a href="../topics/topicIndexD.html#DiphosphaneH">Diphosphane</a>, P2H4.<br>
Phosphorescent minerals continue to emit light after the ultraviolet light ceases.<br>
