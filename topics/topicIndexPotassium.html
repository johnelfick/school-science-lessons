<a href="https://www.rsc.org/periodic-table/element/19/Potassium">Potassium</a>, RSC<br>
Potassium</a>, K (Dutch <i>potasch</i>, <i>potasschen</i> potash) (Latin <i>kalium</i>, K), metal, potassium rod stored in mineral oil,<br>
AAS solution, toxic if ingested or contacts skin<br>
Potassium is a soft and shiny white alkali metal, highest metal in the reactivity series so does not occur in the free state.<br>
Potassium is about 2.5% of the earth's crust, is available in the laboratory as pieces of the metal in liquid paraffin and is used widely in chemistry.<br>
Potassium is the " K" in the common fertilizer NPK, usually as (K2O).<br>
It reacts with dilute HCl or H2SO4 to form H2 and metal ion, reacts with concentrated oxidizing acids, HNO3 or H2SO4 to produce high oxidation number ions,<br>
and sulfur dioxide SO2 or nitrogen dioxide, NO2.<br>
Potassium reacts with cold water and reacts with air to form peroxides.<br>
Potassium has less concentration in extra cellular fluids than in intracellular fluids, where it is the primary cation.<br>
Potassium ions are lost in sweat along with sodium ions.<br>
Potassium metal is banned in many school systems.<br>
Potassium reacts violently with water to form hydrogen gas that may ignite or explode.<br>
Destroy potassium safely with 2-methylpropan-2-ol.<br>
Potassium forms a crust of yellow oxide that may explode when cut.<br>
For school science experiments, use sodium or lithium instead of potassium.<br>

Potassium chromate, (K2CrO4, lemon yellow crystals, MP 975 oC, alkaline aqueous solution<br>
Potassium chromate, as with other chromium (VI) salts, may be carcinogenic, so handle it with care.<br>
However, when used in dilute solution, near neutral pH, it is relatively safe.<br>
When mixed with acid, chromate ions, CrO42-, first form dichromate ions, Cr2O72-, then chromic acid, H2CrO4.<br>
Solutions containing chromic acid are powerfully oxidizing and highly corrosive.<br>
Do NOT use the cleaning mixture called "chromic acid", prepared by dissolving a metal chromate or dichromate in concentrated sulfuric acid.<br>
This cleaning mixture is NOT permitted in schools, because it is dangerously corrosive to skin and eyes.<br>
It is probably no more effective as a cleaning agent than strong detergent solutions or a suitable solvent.<br>
The reactions of potassium chromate and dichromate with S, C, Mg, Al and P are dangerous. and are NOT permitted in schools!.<br>

It was formerly used mixed with sulfuric acid to clean laboratory glassware, but nowadays this procedure NOT permitted in schools.<br>
Oxidation reactions involve the reduction of solutions of chromate or dichromate ions that cause colour changes from yellow or orange to pale green or colourless.<br>
The reactions with the formation of an insoluble metal chromate give brightly coloured precipitates.<br>
Do NOT attempt to isolate these precipitates, because they are carcinogenic.<br>
It is best to prepare these precipitates in the smallest quantities that allow them to be seen.<br>
Do NOT use potassium dichromate solution to colour water for demonstrations.<br>
It is used in machines to breath test for alcohol.<br>

Potassium hydroxide, as a solid or concentrated solution is extremely corrosive to the skin and eyes.<br>
Always wear safety glasses when handling potassium hydroxide, even with dilute concentrations.<br>
If potassium hydroxide enters the eye, rinse the eye instantly with water.<br>
Solutions of potassium hydroxide on the skin feel soapy, because fats in the skin are broken down to form anions of fatty acids, e.g. stearate, palmitate and oleate.<br>
which give the solution a slippery feel.<br>
When potassium hydroxide dissolves in water, a large amount of heat is released.<br>
It sometimes causes the solution to boil violently if it has NOT been stirred!<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.9.1H">3.9.1</a> Prepare potassium nitrate from manure<br>
1. The mineral form of potassium nitrate, nitre, saltpetre (UK), saltpeter (US) cannot be made in any considerable quantity in less than six or eight months.<br>
Use rotted manure ("black earth"), old mortar or wood ashes mixed with straw.<br>
Each week, add the richest kinds of liquid manure, e.g. urine, dung water, water from privies, cesspools, drain to keep the heap moist, but not wet.<br>
Drain off any superfluous liquid to a tank to be used in later watering the heaps.<br>
Turn the whole heap turned over every month to hasten the process of nitrification.<br>
During the last few months of the process, heaps must be kept moist by water only.<br>
As the heap ripens, the nitre is brought to the surface by evaporation, as a white efflorescence, detectable by the taste.<br>
A more accurate method is by leaching a small quantity of the earth, and boiling to dryness, and weighing the salt.<br>
2. Repeated leaching with water to produce a ley is used to get as strong a solution as possible, and extract most of the nitre.<br>
After the sixth leaching, the earth is considered as sufficiently exhausted.<br>
These leys can be put upon fresh earth until the solution is of sufficient density to bear an egg, when it then contains about a 500 g of salt to 4 litres of liquid.<br>
3. The ley contains, nitrate of potash (nitre, potassium nitrate), nitrate of lime, nitrate of magnesia, sodium chloride and potassium chloride.<br>
To convert all other nitrates into nitrate of potash, add wood ashes.<br>
The potash of the ashes takes all the nitric acid of the other nitrates, forming the nitrate of potash (nitre).<br>
The lime and magnesia are precipitated as an insoluble sediment.<br>
TAlso, the ashes can be mixed with the nitrified earth and leached together or the saltpetre ley filtered through wood ashes, or the ley of ashes added to the saltpetre ley.<br>
4. Put the ley in a boiler.<br>
The ley still contains common salt (sodium chloride), and other impurities.<br>
However, nitre, is much more soluble than common salt in boiling water, but much less soluble in cold water.<br>
As the boiling proceeds and the solution becomes more concentrated, the common salt is precipitated in small crystals as a sandy sediment to be raked out.<br>
Remove organic matter rising as scum.<br>
Leave the boiler to cool when the concentration has reached almost the point of saturation.<br>
This point is determined by letting fall a drop of the boiling liquid upon a cold metallic surface so that, if it crystallizes quickly, it is time to stop the boiling.<br>
As the ley cools, most of the nitre separates as crystals, which sink to the bottom.<br>
Remove the crystals and return the mother liquor to the boiler, or used in watering the heaps.<br>
The crude saltpetre still contains 15-20% of impurities, mainly sodium chloride, potassium chloride and organic matter.<br>
5. Refining<br>
Starting with saturated solution of nitre, add glue that seizes upon the organic matter and rises as scum to be removed.<br>
Continue the boiling until the liquid is clear, then cool and constantly stir until most of the nitre is deposited in very fine, needle-like crystals, called saltpetre flour.<br>
Wash off all adhering mother liquor.<br>
The nitre is now dried by gentle heat and constant stirring, and may be considered quite pure, and fit for the manufacture of gunpowder!<br>
6. Analysis<br>
1. A saturated solution of any salt will not dissolve any more of that salt, but will freely dissolve other salts.<br>
2. Nitre mixed with charcoal and heated is converted into carbonate of potash, but common salt is not affected.<br>
However. if saltpetre is mixed with charcoal alone and then heated the reaction is violent and explosive.<br>
To moderate the violence, the saltpetre is mixed with common salt, which does not interfere with the reaction.<br>
Use one part crude saltpetre, four parts common salt, and one-half part charcoal, heated in an iron spoon, until reaction ceases.<br>
The nitre is now changed into carbonate of potash to be dissolved in water and filtered.<br>
The quantity is estimated by the quantity of sulfuric of known strength necessary to neutralize it completely.<br>
3. A strong hot solution of nitre crystallizes on cooling, and that the temperature at which crystals begin to deposit depends upon how much nitre is in the solution.<br>
In a saturated solution of nitre, one hundred parts by weight of water at 32F contains 13.32 parts of nitre.<br>

With potassium sulfate it forms potash alum, (K2SO4.Al2(SO4)3.24H2O.<br>
In other alums where Na or (NH4) = X, they have the formula: X2SO4.Al2(SO4)3.24H2O.<br>
