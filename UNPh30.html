<a href="29.2.1.5.GIF">See diagram: 29.2.1.5</a>: Open right-hand rule.<br>
1. By the open right-hand rule, the extended thumb points in the direction of the conventional current, I, the fingers point in the direction of the magnetic<br>
field, B, the pushing palm points in the direction of magnetic force, F.<br>
2. Induced emf, dynamo, electric generator<br>
See: <a href="Commercial3.html#DitemsH">Dynamo/generator</a> (Commercial).<br>
A changing magnetic field can induce a current in a circuit.<br>
The force driving the current is the induced electromotive force.<br>
The induced current occurs only when the magnetic field changes and the size of the induced current depends on the rate of change of the magnetic field.<br>
A conductor moving to the right, at a right angle to a uniform magnetic field, will have an induced emf, V, across its ends.<br>
he thumb points in the direction of the movement of the conductor, because positive charges move in that direction, i.e. the direction of the conventional 
current, the fingers point in the direction of the magnetic field, B, the pushing palm shows the end of the conductor that becomes positive.<br>
The other end becomes negative as electrons move to that end.<br>
The resulting potential difference across the ends of the rod is called the induced emf, in volts.<br>
If you connect the ends of the moving conductor through an external circuit, a conventional current will flow externally from the positive end to the 
negative end, and inside the conductor from the negative end to the positive end.<br>
The current through the conductor moving perpendicular to magnetic field will cause a magnetic force to oppose further movement of the conductor.<br>
The conductor can keep moving only if an applied force is used.<br>
The size of the induced emf depends on the velocity of the conductor.<br>
3. A motor turns a coil in magnetic field, B.<br>
 The coil with N loops, each area A, rotates with frequency F for time t, cutting the magnetic field lines to induce an emf between its terminals =<br>
 2π X NABF X cos 2pft.<br>
The mechanical energy input from the motor that turns the coil =<br>
electrical energy output + (energy lost to heat and friction).<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="30.4.2H">30.4.2</a> Fleming's left-hand rule<br>
<a href="30.5.0.GIF">See diagram 30.5.0</a>: Force on current in magnetic field, Fleming's left hand rule.<br>
A current carrying conductor at a right angle to a uniform magnetic field experiences a force.<br>
Use Fleming's left-hand rule: the first finger points in the direction of the magnetic field, the middle finger points in the direction of the conventional current, 
the thumb points in the direction of thrust, movement of the conductor.<br>
If the current carrying conductor is at less than a right angle to the uniform magnetic field, the thrust is less.<br>
If the current carrying conductor is parallel to the uniform magnetic field, the thrust is zero.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="30.1.1.1H">30.1.1.1</a> Bicycle dynamo, the "missing wire"<br>
See: <a href="Commercial3.html#DitemsH">Dynamo/generator</a> (Commercial).<br>
<a href="30.1.3.1.GIF">See diagram 30.1.3.1</a>: Bicycle dynamo.<br>
1. A dynamo is a machine that converts mechanical energy into electric energy by electric induction, usually by a rotation conductor in a magnetic 
field, e.g. the bicycle dynamo.<br>
People who ride bicycles with lights powered by bicycle dynamos are aware that the faster they ride the brighter the headlight.<br>
To demonstrate the effect of speed in the laboratory, mount the dynamo on a spindle that can be turned with a crank.<br>
Complete the circuit by connecting the electrical output leads to 1.5 V lamp in a lamp holder to a galvanometer, 2.0 - 2.5 MA DC.<br>
The faster you turn the crank the brighter the light or the greater the reading on the galvanometer.<br>
A dynamo converts mechanical energy into ac or dc electrical energy usually by rotating a conductor in a magnetic field.<br>
2. The four ways to get a dynamo to give a higher current are as follows:<br>
* Use stronger magnets.<br>
This generates a higher voltage that forces a higher current in the circuit.<br>
* Reduce the load, i.e. the resistance of the external circuit of lamps and appliances.<br>
* Rewind the dynamo with heavier wires, because its own internal resistance of windings may not carry a bigger current without overheating.<br>
* Run it faster.<br>
In a bicycle dynamo the rotor is a permanent magnet and the emf is induced in the coil that remains at rest.<br>
 3. Bicycle dynamo, the "missing wire" in a bicycle generator circuit<br>
In a bicycle dynamo, the rotor is a permanent magnet, usually an 8 pole circular magnet and the emf is induced in two coils that are stationary in reference to the rotor.<br>
Only one wire connects a bicycle generator to the bicycle light.<br>
Where is the other wire to complete the circuit?<br>
When the bicycle is in motion, a permanent magnet inside the generator rotates in the centre of a coil of tightly wound copper wire.<br>
The spinning magnet creates electricity in the copper coil.<br>
Electricity flows through the wire to the light, through the filament of the bulb, through the light casing, the bicycle fork, and the metal casing of the generator, back to the coil in the generator.<br>
A screw in the generator casing pierces the layer of paint on the fork to complete the circuit.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="30.1.1.2H">30.1.1.2</a> Electric generator, alternator, AC generator<br>
See: <a href="Commercial3.html#DitemsH">Dynamo/generator</a> (Commercial).<br>
An electric generator is a machine that converts mechanical energy into electrical power.<br>
Electromagnetic generators work by either:<br>
* rotating a magnet inside a coil, e.g. bicycle "dynamo", or 
* rotating a coil inside a magnet, e.g. motor car generator, power station.<br>
An electromagnetic generator that produces alternating current it may be called an alternator, but if it produces direct current it may be called a dynamo.<br>
A bicycle dynamo, e.g. the popular sidewall-running bottle-shaped "dynamo", produces alternating current, so it really is a bicycle "generator" if this distinction is made.<br>
<a href="UNPh32.6.html#32.5.6.4">See diagram 32.5.6.4</a>: Voltage of a generator.<br>
In a motor vehicle, a generator gets mechanical energy from the fan belt and, in turn, produces electrical energy that charges the battery by being 
converted into chemical energy converts some electrical energy into heat in the armature and the connecting wires.<br>
Some chemical energy from the battery may be converted back to electrical energy that may be converted into light, or sound when the horn is pressed.<br>
The generator has an inner set of coils that become an electromagnet that turn inside an outer set of coils.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="30.1.1.3H">30.1.1.3</a> Force on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field<br>
<a href="29.2.1.5.GIF">See diagram: 29.2.1.5</a>: Open right-hand rule.<br>
1. A wire carrying an electrical current through in a magnetic field, has each of the moving charges of the current experiencing the Lorentz force,<br>
which together create a force on the wire, the Laplace force.<br>
So F = I × × B, where I is the conventional current flow I, is the length of wire, and B is the magnetic field.<br>
2. Right-hand rule for a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field B<br>
Apply the right-hand rule with the hand flat on the table with the fingers pointing to the left and the thumb pointing away from you, the fingers point 
in the direction of the magnetic field, the thumb points in the direction of conventional current and the direction of the force is from the palm upward.<br>
The angle between the fingers and the thumb, <nobr>α</nobr>, is 90<sup>o</sup>.<br>
3. If you think of conventional electric current as a flow of positive electric charges, the electric current will experience a force if it flows through a 
magnetic field in the same way that charges moving through a magnetic field experiences a force predicted by the open right-hand rule.<br>
The force F (newton) on a straight uniform wire length in a uniform magnetic field = I (amperes) × (metres) × B (tesla) sin α, where <nobr>α</nobr> = 
angle between the direction of the current, I, and the direction of the magnetic field.<br>
If the wire is parallel to the magnetic field lines, the force is zero.<br>
If the wire is at right angles to the magnetic field lines, the force is maximum.<br>
Experiment<br>
<a href="30.1.3.01.GIF">See diagram 30.1.3.0.1: </a> Force on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field.<br>
1. Use two retort stands to hang a thin strip of aluminium strip between the poles of the magnet, e.g. Rola permanent magnet.<br>
Connect an AC / DC Power supply (10 amps).<br>
Close the switch, S1, and the aluminium strip experiences a force caused by the interaction between the current I and the magnetic field B.<br>
Use a rotary switch, S2, to reverse the direction of current flow to deflect the strip in the opposite direction.<br>
2. A rectangular loop of wire aligns perpendicular to a magnetic field.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="30.5.4H">30.5.4</a> Retentivity<br>
Retentivity means ability to respond after stimulus is removed, e.g. in ferromagnetic substances measured as residual flux density.<br>
In a magnetic hysteresis loop, retentivity is the value of B at zero magnetic field and is called remanence.<br>
A soft iron bar will cling to a U-shaped electromagnet when the current is turned off, but no longer attract after it is pulled away.<br>

 1. Horseshoe magnet, 2. Axle, 3. Commutator, 4. Coil, 5. Brass strip, 6. Electric motor with 3 coils, A Contact (brush), Aw Wire from contact to 
 coil, B Contact (brush), Bw Wire from contact to coil.<br>
 Experiment<br>
1. Fix a simple coil, mounted on an axle, between
 the poles of a horseshoe magnet.<br>
 Two wires from the coil connect to the commutator.<br>
 The commutator is a cylindrical insulator revolving on the axle with
 two strips of brass attached.<br>
 The commutator rotates with the coil.<br>
 Each brass strip is joined to one wire from the coil.<br>
 Two carbon contacts, brushes, touch the side of the commutator and
 allow electric current to pass from the battery to the commutator.<br>
 Electric current goes from the battery to brass strip A then along wire Aw, through the coil then back through wire Bw and brass strip B then back 
 to the battery to complete the circuit.<br>
 When the commutator and coil make one half turn, the current enters 
 through brass strip B and returns through brass strip A, reversing 
 the current in the coil.<br>
 The electric motor runs more smoothly if more than one coil is used.<br>
 This electric motor uses a permanent magnet, but most electric motors
 use a field coil that forms a more powerful electromagnet.<br>
 2. Using Fleming's left hand rule, direction of 
 thumb is thrust, first finger is magnetic field and second finger is current.<br>
 In the diagram, side 7 to 8 of the coil has upward force on it and
 side 9 to 10 has downward force on it.<br>
 So the coil turns until it is vertical and the brushes no longer
touch the brass strips, because of the gaps between them, and no current 
 flows.<br>
 However, due to inertia of the commutator, the coil keeps turning 
so side 7 to 8 is now on the right side and side 9 to 10 is on the left 
 side.<br>
 The brushes touch the brass strips again and the coil keeps turning clockwise.<br>

<a href="30.1.3.3.GIF">See diagram 30.1.3.3</a>: Electric motor 1.<br>
An electric motor is like an electric generator operating in reverse, because it uses electrical energy to produce mechanical work.<br>
This simple model uses current from a dry cell to excite the field magnets as well as the armature windings.<br>
Experiment<br>
Prepare a board 20 X 25 cm for the base.<br>
Drill a small hole through the centre and drive a 15 cm spike up through it.<br>
Wind 100 turns of insulated bell wire on to two other 15 cm spikes, leaving about 30 cm for free ends.<br>
Drive these spikes into the base 15.5 cm apart.<br>
Drive two small nails on the diagonal and 5 cm from the spike at the centre.<br>
Strip the free ends of each coil and twist them several times around the nails and bend them so that they will rest in contact with the central spike.<br>
These ends will serve as brushes.<br>
The field coils must be wound in the proper direction.<br>
The other ends of the coils are fastened to the screws in the corners of the base.<br>
 Construct the armature coil and commutator.<br>
Drill a hole crosswise through the top of a 4-cm cork and force a 13-cm spike through it.<br>
Wind 40 turns of insulated bell wire on to each end, using the direction of windings shown in the diagram.<br>
Scrape the free ends of the bell wire.<br>
Cut out the centre of the cork with a knife and insert the closed end of a 13-cm test-tube so that it fits tightly in the cork.<br>
Construct the commutator.<br>
Cut out two rectangular pieces of sheet copper about 4 cm long, and wide enough to reach around the test-tube with a gap of about 6 mm between them.<br>
Curve the pieces of copper to fit the test-tube.<br>
Punch small holes and into them and solder or twist one of the scraped free ends of the armature windings.<br>
Bind these commutator plates securely into position at top and bottom with adhesive tape to complete the armature and commutator.<br>
Set it into position on the vertical bearing and bring the brushes into contact with the commutator.<br>
Turn the test-tube in the cork until the brushes lie across the gaps in the commutator when the armature is in line with the field magnets.<br>
Now if your windings and connexions are all as shown, connect to one or two cells.<br>
With a slight push of the armature the motor should start off at a lively speed.<br>
If it does not go, examine the brushes to see whether they make a light, but certain contact.<br>
It may also help to change the angle of the brushes.<br>
To test this point, untwist the brushes from the nails and hold them lightly against the commutator plates with the fingers.<br>
While holding them, always parallel, swing them around at different angles while a helper turns the armature with his hand.<br>
Note the point at which the armature picks up most speed and set the brushes at that point.<br>
If the rotor does not turn, check the contact of the brushes with the commutator.<br>

Experiment<br>
1. Fix a simple coil, mounted on an axle, between the poles of a horseshoe magnet.<br>
Two wires from the coil connect to the commutator.<br>
The commutator is a cylindrical insulator revolving on the axle with two strips of brass attached.<br>
The commutator rotates with the coil.<br>

Electric current goes from the battery to brass strip A then along wire Aw, through the coil then back through wire Bw and brass strip B then back to the 
battery to complete the circuit.<br>
When the commutator and coil make one half turn, the current enters through brass strip B and returns through brass strip A, reversing the current in the coil.<br>
The electric motor runs more smoothly if more than one coil is used.<br>
This electric motor uses a permanent magnet, but most electric motors use a field coil that forms a more powerful electromagnet.<br>
2. Using Fleming's left hand rule, direction of thumb is thrust, first finger is magnetic field and second finger is current.<br>
In the diagram, side 7 to 8 of the coil has upward force on it and side 9 to 10 has downward force on it.<br>
So the coil turns until it is vertical and the brushes no longer touch the brass strips, because of the gaps between them, and no current flows.<br>
However, due to inertia of the commutator, the coil keeps turning so side 7 to 8 is now on the right side and side 9 to 10 is on the left side.<br>
The brushes touch the brass strips again and the coil keeps turning clockwise.<br>
3. Use strong bar magnets, bent pieces of tin plate, a thick piece of cardboard wound with many turns of thick 22 gauge wire.<br>
Fray the ends of the wire so that they brush against 2 tin plate contacts connected to dry cell batteries.<br>
To start the motor, give a little push to get the current moving.<br>
Instead of the cells supplying the brushes with current, insert a torch globe receiving current from the brushes.<br>
Turn the armature shaft with a pulley and belt.<br>
4. Field magnets and brushes<br>
Push a 15 cm nail up through the centre of a 20 × 25 cm card to act as a vertical bearing.<br>
Wind a coil 100 turns of bell wire on 2 nails to act as field magnets.<br>
Push the nail down into the cardboard 15.5 cm apart, each side of the spike.<br>
Push down 2 small nails on the diagonal and 5 cm from the centre of the card.<br>
Strip insulation from the ends of each coil so that you can twist the wire twice around the small nails then touch the central large nail.<br>
The touching ends will act as brushes.<br>
Check the direction of windings of the coils from the diagram.<br>
Attach the other ends of the coils in the field magnets to screws in the corners of the card.<br>
Make the armature coil.<br>
Push a 15 cm nail crosswise through a 4 cm cork.<br>
Wind 40 turns of bell wire on the nails, with the direction of windings as shown in the diagram.<br>
Strip insulation from the ends of each coil.<br>
Cut out part of the centre of the lower side of the cork so that the end of a test-tube fits tightly.<br>
5. Commutator<br>
Cut out a rectangular piece of thin sheet copper 4 cm × circumference of the test-tube.<br>
Cut off 12 mm from the circumference length then cut the piece of copper in half.<br>
Fit the copper pieces to curve around the test-tube with a gap of 6 mm between them.<br>
Make a small hole in each copperplate to attach one end of an armature coil.<br>
Fix the copper plates in position around the test-tube as a commutator.<br>
Set up the rotor.<br>
The armature and commutator form the rotor.<br>
Set the rotor into position on the vertical bearing.<br>
Adjust the brushes to contact the commutator.<br>
Turn the test-tube within the cork until the brushes lie across the gaps in the commutator when the armature is in line with the field magnets.<br>
Run the electric motor.<br>
Connect the screws to the terminals of a dry cell or lead cell accumulator using a car headlight bulb to limit the current, or low voltage power supply.<br>
Give the rotor a slight push and it should keep turning.<br>
If the rotor does not turn check the contact of the brushes with the commutator.<br>

Experiment<br>
1. A homopolar motor does not have components to reverse the polarity during operation, there is only one current-carrying path.<br>
Experiment<br>
Wear safety glasses.<br>
Put a flat head ferromagnetic screw on a circular neodymium disk magnet with conductive sides, with the screw flat head down.<br>
Attach the magnet and screw to one end of a 1.5 V battery or an alkaline C-cell, so that the contact between the point of the screw and the battery can 
serve as a bearing.<br>
With the left hand, hold the upper stripped end of the wire down on the negative end of the battery.<br>
With the right hand, lightly touch the lower stripped end of the wire to the side of the circular magnet.<br>
The magnet and screw start to spin.<br>
The battery is short circuited by the copper wire, so run the motor for a very short before the battery is used up and the copper wire gets very hot!<br>
2. Use the Lorentz force law to determine the direction of spin.<br>
Conventional current flows from the + end of the battery to the screw, sideways through the magnet to the wire, through the wire to the negative end of the battery.<br>
The magnetic field, B, is parallel to the axis of symmetry of the magnet, i.e. upward.<br>
Electric current, i, flows through the magnet from the centre of the magnet to the edge, i.e. in ae radial direction, perpendicular to axis of symmetry of the magnet.<br>
So there is a force, i × B, forwards and perpendicular both to the moving electric charges and the direction of the magnetic field.<br>
The force is in the tangential direction, and the magnet begins to spin, forwards, towards you.<br>

 where N = number of turns of the coil, B = magnetic field, A = area of the coil, and <nobr>ω</nobr> = the angular speed of the coil.<br>
 2. An electric motor converts electrical energy into mechanical energy, like an electric generator operating in reverse.<br>
 The coil in an electric motor moves in the same way as the moving coil in a meter.<br>
 Wind the coil on the core so that both move round.<br>
 This is called an armature.<br>
 As the coil in the electric motor turns from one side of the magnetic field to the other, the current through it must be reversed, so that forces on it will keep it 
 rotating in one direction.<br>
 Make the electrical contacts with the coil in the motor through a split ring commutator, so that the current reverses at the right position.<br>
 3. The current flowing through a coil in a magnetic field produces a torque on the coil = NIAB sin A, where A = angle between the magnetic field 
 lines and a line at right angles to the plane of the coil.<br>
 A split ring commutator reverses the direction of current, I, each time "sin A" changes sign, so the torque always rotates the coil in the same direction.<br>
However, the rotating coil also acts as a generator to produce a back emf in the coil that opposes the source of voltage that drives the motor.<br>
 (Potential difference across the terminals of the coil = voltage supplied to the coil - a back emf).<br>
 (Current through the coil = voltage supplied to the coil - back emf / resistance of the coil).<br>

 The electric motor uses the magnetic effect of a current to produce movement.<br>
 1. A magnetic field exists around a conductor carrying an electric current.<br>
 Reversing the direction of the current also reverses the direction of the magnetic field.<br>
 2. If electric current passes through a conductor in a magnetic field, a force acts on the conductor, which can cause it to move.<br>
 Lines of magnetic force from the two sources of magnetism interact so that a mechanical force arises, which tends to move the conductor in the direction 
 shown in the diagram.<br>
 3. If a conductor is arranged as a loop so that current flows in opposite directions on each side of the loop, the loop moves with rotary motion 
 through 90<sup>o </sup>then stops, because the interaction of the two magnetic fields no longer exerts a force thrust on the conductors.<br>
 4. If the loop is connected to the current source through a commutator and brushes, and additional loops are included as in a simple generator, the assembly 
 turns with continuos motion.<br>
 5. The assembly behaves like an electric motor.<br>

<a href="29.179.GIF">See diagram 29.179</a>: Open solenoid.<br>
Experiment<br>
 1. Place a card through a solenoid.<br>
 The solenoid could consist of many turns of a wire spring or a thin wire twisted round a suitable former, e.g. a test-tube.<br>
 Connect the solenoid to a switch and battery and sprinkle iron filings on the cardboard.<br>
 Note if you see a similarity in the patterns produced by the bar magnet and the solenoid.<br>
 2. Use a magnetic field about a conductor wind a coil of wire around it.<br>
 The magnetic fields created by the current in the several loops of the coil combine into one composite field as to create a solenoid.<br>
 The strength of the magnetic field of a solenoid is proportional to the number of turns of wire in the coil and the current flowing through the wire.<br>
 You can measure the strength of the magnetic field of a solenoid in ampere turns, i.e. current in amperes × number of turns.<br>
 If a soft iron core is inside a solenoid, the lines of magnetic force will take the easier path through the iron, and the magnetic field produced at  the ends of the iron core will be stronger.<br>
 To make a coil, wrap an insulated connecting wire around a small test-tube turn by turn and leave connecting wires.<br>
 Peel off their end insulation layers then connect them to a DC low voltage electrical source.<br>
 If you use a dry cell battery, do not turn it on for too long a time.<br>
 Place several large needles into the test-tube.<br>
 Turn on the electrical source.<br>
 Note the needles' directions such as their needle points pointing to the bottom or mouth of the test-tube.<br>
 Take the needles out of the test-tube and let them to attract fine iron filings or pins to observe every needle's magnetism intensity.<br>
 3. Wind five evenly spaced turns of bell wire around a wooden cylinder.<br>
 Slide the coil off the cylinder.<br>
 Fit the cylinder into slots in a piece of cardboard so that the cardboard appears to cut the coil in half length ways.<br>
 Connect the coil to the terminals of a dry cell or lead cell accumulator or low voltage power supply using a car headlight bulb in series.<br>
 Sprinkle iron filings evenly on the card.<br>
 Switch on the current.<br>
 Tap the card gently with the end of a pencil.<br>
 The iron filings move into a pattern showing the magnetic field.<br>
 Note the pattern inside the coil and outside the coil.<br>
 Switch off the current.<br>
 Repeat the experiment using a plotting compass instead of iron filings.<br>
4. To observe the distribution of magnetic lines of force inside an open solenoid, wrap 5 turns of single electric connecting wire around a cylinder 
with a smooth surface and leave connecting wires.<br>
 Put the coil off the cylinder and separate theses turns at certain distance.<br>
 Use a cardboard cylinder, then cut off 2 grooves, with each groove wider than the diameter of the connecting wire.<br> 
The distance between the 2 grooves is narrower than the inner diameter of the coil, so that the bar of the cardboard between the two grooves can support the coil
 when you insert the coil into the grooves.<br>
 Connect the 2 ends of this coil to a DC source.<br>
 Connect a slip rheostat in series to prevent the electrical source overloading.<br>
 Scatter fine iron filings on the cardboard.<br>
 Gently tap the cardboard then observe the distribution of the iron filings.<br>
 Usually you call such a magnetic field a magnetic field inside an open solenoid.<br>
 If there is no space between turns of a coil, you call it a closed solenoid.<br>
 This method is also used to observe magnetic field inside a closed solenoid.<br>
 Another method is to substitute sheets of plastic or Plexiglas for the cardboard.<br>
 Cut holes in the sheets corresponding to turns of the coil.<br>
5. To map the magnetic fields of a solenoid and a bar magnet, draw 2 parallel lines 2 cm apart on a 10 cm<sup>2</sup> sheet of cardboard.<br>
 Punch two rows of holes through the cardboard, 0.5 cm apart.<br>
Using DC C22 gauge copper wire, wind a solenoid onto the cardboard by threading the wire through the holes.<br>
 Support the cardboard horizontally, sprinkle iron filings over it and connect your solenoid to a 6 volt battery.<br>
 Tap the cardboard and notice what happens to the iron filings.<br>
The little pieces of iron have themselves become magnetized by induction and, when jostled by tapping, set themselves in the direction of the fields

 More filings are attracted to the nail when the current is on.<br>
 The nail becomes a magnet when the current flows around it.<br>

 Place the removable gauge into the solenoid then turn on the switch to make the solenoid current.<br>
 Here the solenoid carrying current produces magnetic field inside the solenoid.<br>
If you magnetize the gauge and wire at the same time, they repel each other so that the gauge is moved.<br>
 The distance moved depends on the size of the magnetic force between the gauge and the wire.<br>
 The magnetic force depends on the magnetization characters of the materials of the gauge and wire and the size of the current at the solenoid.<br>

 However, the force of attraction is negligible at low current values.<br>

Electromagnetic induction, induction, refers to the production of an electrical or magnetic state in something, because of its proximity to an electrified 
 or magnetized body without any physical contact.<br>
<a href="29.2.1.5.GIF">See diagram: 29.2.1.5</a>: Open right-hand rule.<br>
 Induced emf in conductor moving in magnetic field, open right-hand
 rule:<br>
 1. Magnetic flux measures the number of magnetic field lines crossing 
 an area.<br>
 So if a magnetic field strength B crosses an area A at angle θ, magnetic 
 flux <nobr>Φ (</nobr><nobr>phi</nobr>) = (B cos θ)A = BA cos θ weber, 
 (Wb), where 1 Wb = 1 T.m<sup>2</sup>.<br>
 1. An electromotive force, emf is produced in a circuit by a change of magnetic flux through the circuit or by relative motion of the circuit and the 
 magnetic flux.<br>
 In a closed circuit an induced current will be produced.<br>
 This phenomenon is called electromagnetic induction.<br>
 The electromotive force is called inducted electromotive force.<br>
 2. Electric current is produced in a closed circuit when there is relative movement of its conductor in a magnetic field.<br>
There is no battery or other source of power in a circuit in which an induced current appears, because the energy supply is provided by the relative 
 motion of the conductor and the magnetic field.<br>
 The magnitude of the induced current depends upon the rate at which 
 the magnetic flux is cut by the conductor.<br>
 Its direction is given by Fleming's left hand rule.<br>
3. If current flows through a long straight wire, the strength of the magnetic field at distance from the wire depends on the property of t he substance 
 in which the magnetic field is measured called magnetic permeability, μ.<br>
 For a vacuum, or air ("free space") μ<sub>0</sub> = 4<nobr><font
 size="3" face="TimesH">π</font></nobr> × 10<sup>-7</sup>.<br>
 4. Relative permeability compares the permeability of a substance with the permeability of free space.<br>
 Diamagnetic materials, e.g. lead, have relative permeability less than 1 so they decrease the strength of a magnetic field in a solenoid.<br>
 Paramagnetic materials, e.g. aluminium, have relative permeability slightly more than 1 less so they slightly increase the magnetism in a solenoid.<br>
 Ferromagnetic materials, e.g. iron and iron alloys, have relative permeability more than 50.<br>
 So the magnetic field of a solenoid coil is much greater if it has a "soft" iron core.<br>
 In a long coil solenoid, the right-hand grip rule on any coil shows the direction of the uniform magnetic field in the solenoid.<br>

Multimeter<br>
Experiment<br>
 1. Usually, the batteries must be fitted.<br>
 Two test leads, one red and one black, must be plugged into the multimeter.<br>
 A multimeter with two sockets has them colour coded to show which 
lead plugs into which socket.<br>
Switch on the power switch, if it has one, select one of the OHMS ranges using the main selector switch, a large dial on the front of the multimeter, 
 then connect the ends of the test leads or "probes" together.<br>
 The display should read close to zero.<br>
2. Most multimeters have four measurement options:<br>
 1. DC voltage, 2. DC current, 3. AC voltage, and 4. Resistance (ohms), with each measurement option divided into ranges.<br>
 A range is named after the maximum reading possible, e.g. a multimeter has a 10 volt DC range will be overloaded if testing more than 10 volts.<br>
 So before testing, check that the multimeter is on a suitable range and the test leads are plugged into the right sockets.<br>
 Most multimeters do not have fuse protection for higher current ranges.<br>
3. To measure DC current, place the multimeter
in series with the circuit so that all the current flows through the multimeter.<br>
 Do this by disconnecting a wire or component then reconnecting the
 whole circuit.<br>
 When measuring current, start with the multimeter on the highest range and work down with the test leads plugged into 
 the correct socket.<br>
 Connect to the circuit with the correct polarity.<br>
 Connect the red probe to the more positive side of the circuit.<br>
 Connect the black probe to the more negative side of the circuit.<br>
 On a digital multimeter, if connecting with the wrong polarity, you 
 still get the right reading, but with a "minus" sign in front of the value.<br>
4. To measure DC voltage place the multimeter in parallel with the circuit or component being measured and measure the potential difference (voltage) 
 between the two points.<br>
 The test leads must be in the right multimeter sockets, observe polarity 
 and start with the highest range and work down.<br>
5. To measure AC voltage, follow the same steps
 as with DC voltage.<br>
 During one cycle an AC wave starts at zero, rises to a peak, falls
 back to zero and then does the same thing in the other direction.<br>
 Most multimeters show the "RMS" (Root Mean Square), value of the 
voltage.<br>
 This value is a type of average for the voltage that is always changing.<br>
 The RMS voltage has exactly the same "work value" as a DC voltage, so if an electric heater is supplied with 240 volts RMS, and then 240 volts 
 DC, the heater would give out the same heat.<br>
 Most multimeters can only indicate the correct RMS voltage when the 
 AC signal is a sine wave.<br>
6. To measuring resistance, the component being
 measured must not be affected by other components in the circuit.<br>
 For example, do not measure a resistor when there is another resistor 
 in parallel is interfering with the reading.<br>
 So remove one end of the component from the circuit to avoid any
possible influence when measuring.<br>
 The power must be turned off before making any measurement or disconnecting
 any components.<br>
 Select the lowest resistance range and place the probes across the
 resistor or component being tested.<br>
 If the multimeter does not give a good reading, switch up to the
next range.<br>
 Chose the range where the multimeter gives the greatest number of 
digits after the decimal point.<br>

Voltage is produced in a conductor when the conductor moves through a magnetic field, or, a magnetic field moves through the conductor in a 
 way that cuts the magnetic lines of force of the field.<br>
 Generators produce electricity by electromagnetic induction.<br>
Voltage can be produced by magnetism by the following:<br>
a conductor, in which the voltage will be produced,<br>
a magnetic field in the conductor's vicinity and,<br>
relative motion between the field and the conductor.<br>
 So all the above must be present.<br>
 The conductor must be moved to cut across the magnetic lines of force, or, the field must be moved so that the lines of force are cut by the conductor.<br>
When a conductor moves across a magnetic field to cut the lines of force, electrons within the conductor are moved in one direction or another so 
 an electromotive force, emf, or voltage, is created.<br>
 In diagram 32.1.23 note the following:<br>
 1. the magnetic field existing between the poles of the C-shape magnet,<br>
 2. the copper wire conductor,<br>
 3. the relative motion as the wire is moved across the magnetic field.<br>
 In diagram 32.1.23 (A) the copper wire conductor is moving towards 
you, because of the magnetically induced electromotive force, 
 emf, acting on the electrons in the copper.<br>
 The right hand end of the conductor becomes negative and the left 
hand end becomes positive.<br>
 In diagram 32.1.23 (B) the conductor is not moving, so there is no 
longer an induced emf and no difference in potential between the 
 two ends of the copper wire.<br>
 In diagram 32.1.23 (C) the conductor is moving away from you creating
 an induced emf in the reversed direction.<br>
 In diagram 32.1.23(D) it shows a path for electron flow between the
 ends of the conductor.<br>
 Electrons can leave the negative end and flow to the positive end 
and continue as long as the emf exists.<br>
 The induced emf can also be created by holding the conductor stationary 
 and moving the magnetic field.<br>

<a href="30.5.02.GIF">See diagram 30.5.02</a>: Lenz's law.<br>
 1. The magnet approaches the coil downwards with its north pole nearest the coil so the induced current flows from right to left so that the coil behaves as if it is a magnet with its north pole nearest the magnet.<br>
 2. The magnet moves away from the coil upwards with its north pole nearest the coil so the induced current flows from left to right so that the coil 
 behaves as if it is a magnet with its south pole nearest the magnet.<br>
 3. Lenz's law states that an induced current flows in the direction opposing the change that caused the current.<br>
 An induced current will cause a current flow in a direction to oppose 
 the cause of the induced current.<br>
 This law is an example of the principle of conservation of energy 
 An induced emf is found in a loop of wire when there is a change
in the magnetic flux around the loop of wire.<br>
 Lenz's law states that if an emf is induced in a loop of wire, it will produce a current whose magnetic flux will always oppose the original change 
of magnetic flux.<br>
If a magnet is pushed into a coil, the induced emf in the coil will produce a current whose magnetic field tends to push the magnet out.<br>
If a magnet is pulled out of a coil, the current produced by the induced emf in the coil will tend to pull the magnet back in again.<br>
If mechanical energy is used to turn a coil in a magnetic field then a variable emf will be induced across the ends of the coil.<br>
Lenz's law follows from the law of conservation of energy.<br>

 In a coil with n loops,<br>
 (Induced emf, = - n × change of magnetic flux / time).<br>
