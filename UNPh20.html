(J. A. C. Charles 1746-1823) (J. L. Gay-Lussac 1778-1850)<br>
For a given mass of gas at constant pressure, the volume, V, is proportional to the absolute or Kelvin temperature of the gas, T,<br>
Volume = constant × T, V / T = constant provided pressure is constant.<br>
Volume is proportional to temperature, V1 / T1 = V2 / T2, where T = absolute temperature, (Absolute zero = -273<sup>o</sup>C)<br>
For a given mass of gas at constant pressure, the volume, V, increases by 1/ 273 rd of its volume at 0<sup>o</sup>C for every Celsius degree rise in temperature: 
Vt = Vo[1 + (1 / 273)t]<br>
The new internal pressure, P2, of a litre of gas at 20<sup>o</sup>C, enclosed at pressure 770 mmHg, then heated to 100<sup>o</sup>C = P1 / T1 = P2 / T2, 
 (V1 = V2), 770 / 293 = P2 / 373, So P2 = 980 mm Hg<br>
 Charles's law (J. A. C. Charles 1746-1823)<br>
 For a given mass of gas at constant pressure, the volume is proportional to the absolute thermodynamic temperature, K., V = KT.<br>
 So all gases have the same coefficient of expansion at constant pressure.<br>
 However, this is strictly true only at low pressures and high temperatures.<br>
 Gay-Lussac's law (J. L. Gay-Lussac 1778-1850):<br>
When gases combine chemically, the volumes of the reactants and the volume of the gaseous product bear simple relationships to each other under the same conditions of temperature and pressure.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2">Experiment<br>
 Quantitative treatment of ideal gases.<br>
 Boltzman's Constant, approximations used for real gases<br>
 Put a drop of oil into the capillarity tube to seal a column of air.<br>
 Measure the length of the trapped column of air rather than its volume.<br>
 Use a spring band to fix a capillarity tube and a thermometer together, 
 put them into a beaker.<br>
 Use the scale intervals on a thermometer to measure length.<br>
 To read easily, the lowest level of a column of air trapped in a capillarity 
 tube is better to meet at 0<sup>o</sup>C on the thermometer.<br>
 Then record the length of the column of air by using the scale nearest 
 to top of the column of air.<br>
 Measure a set of values of length of a column of air and temperature 
 between 0<sup>o</sup>C and 100<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 Before the experiment, mix crushed ice and water in a bottle of mineral 
 water, put them into a beaker.<br>
 Record your temperature readings in a suitable position of set up the 
 table.<br>
 Then pour tap water into the beaker, heat it by an alcohol burner.<br>
 As the temperature reaches 40<sup>o</sup>C, 60<sup>o</sup>C, 80<sup>o</sup>C, 
 record the length of the column of air trapped in a capillarity tube each.<br>
 Remove the alcohol burner before taking records.<br>
 As water boils, record the last reading.<br>
 Draw a graph of temperature t and length of the column of air L so 
 your graph can show how of volume of air varies with temperature.<br>

PV = constant, if temperature is constant (from a pressure / volume graph)<br>
Robert Boyle (1627-1691), For a given mass of gas at constant temperature, the volume is inversely proportional to the pressure, PV = constant.<br>
The Boyle's law relationship would be true only for an ideal gas with particles that occupy no space, have no forces between them, and have perfectly elastic collisions between them and between the particles and the walls of the container.<br>
The pressure of a gas is caused by the gas particles colliding with the walls of the container.<br>
 V1 / V2 = P2 / P1, P1V1 = P2 V2<br>
 The volume of a gas enclosed in a cylinder is halved when the piston 
 is pushed down half way.<br>
 This action doubles the number of molecules per cubic centimetre, so there are twice as many collisions with the walls of the cylinder that causes the pressure to double.<br>
 P1V1 = P2 V2, 1 × 1 = P2 × 0.5, So P2 = 2.<br>

<a href="./images/12.301.gif">See diagram 12.301</a>: Syringes and air pressure.<br>
[Some school systems do not allow the use of syringes in the classroom.]<br>
1. With the tip sealed, use a syringe to compress air or to produce a partial vacuum.<br>
Attach a small piece of plastic tubing to seal the tip with a pinch clamp or seal the syringe by pushing the tip into a wooden block drilled to the appropriate size.<br>
 With this base as a platform, use the syringe in a vertical position 
 as a balance for measuring weight by air compression.<br>
You can quantify all the following experiments, because syringes are already graduated.<br>
2. Fill the syringe with a small amount of air and hang it inverted to serve as a "spring type" balance.<br>
3. Compress moist air within a syringe to cause water condensation and make "artificial rain".<br>
4. Attach a length piece of plastic tubing to make a simple syringe pump.<br>
5. Put water in the tube to make an air thermometer or use 12 m of tubing to make a water barometer.<br>
6. Couple two syringes with a piece of tubing to show pressure changes within closed systems.<br>

See: <a href="Comlist.html#PressureH">Pressure</a> (Commercial).<br>
<a href="./images/4.238x.gif">See diagram 4.238</a>: Volume and pressure of air.<br>
 1. Use a rubber stopper that just fits inside a measuring cylinder 
or large syringe.<br>
 Attach it to the lower end of a wooden rod.<br>
 Fit a lid to the upper end of the rod to act as a scale pan.<br>
 Lubricate the piston so formed with some petroleum jelly or heavy engine 
 oil.<br>
 Use the piston to trap air in the container, put different weights 
on the pan and measure the volume of air inside the glass cylinder for 
 each weight.<br>
 Note that the volume is in inverse proportion to the pressure.<br>
 At constant temperature as the volume, V, decreases the pressure, P, 
increases, so P × V = a constant.<br>
 This relationship is called Boyle's law.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="20.243H"></a>20.243 Cold air is heavier than
 warm air, inverted paper bag balance<br>
<a href="./images/37.118.gif">See diagram 37.118</a>: Balanced flasks.<br>
 1. Use two identical paper bags or balloons that are the same size.<br>
 Inflate each by blowing into them.<br>
 Tie the openings closed tightly with string.<br>
 Tie the end of the string into a loop and suspend the bags from the
 end of a balanced rod.<br>
 Move the loops along the rod until the inflated bags exactly balance.<br>
 Gently heat the air beneath one bag with a small candle.<br>
 The bag containing the heated air moves up and the bag containing the
 cooler air moves down.<br>
 Move the candle under the other bag to see the same result.<br>
 The bags are sealed and so the mass of gas is unchanged when heating 
 or cooling takes place.<br>
 This experiment shows Archimedes' principle in action, not mass change.<br>
2. Open two same size paper bags.<br>
 Attach identical pieces of string to the bottom of each bag with an
 identical pieces of adhesive tape.<br>
 Make a loop in the other end of each piece of string.<br>
 Put the loops over each end of a balanced rod.<br>
 Adjust the positions of the loops until the rod is horizontal.<br>
 Heat the air below one paper bag.<br>
 The end of the rod supporting that paper bag rises.<br>
 Leave the balance to stand without heating a bag.<br>
 The rod becomes horizontal again.<br>
 Heat the air below the other bag.<br>
 The other end of the rod rises.<br>
 This experiment shows that a volume of warm air weighs slightly less 
 than a volume of cool air.<br>
 However, the experiment does not give any information about the weight
 of a volume of air.<br>
 The flame under the paper bag heats the air in it and it expands, following 
 Charles's law.<br>
 Some heated air spills out of the paper bag leaving less air and less
 dense air in the paper bag.<br>
 The air in the heated paper bag weighs less than the air it displaces<br>
By Archimedes' principle there is an upthrust greater than its weight that causes the paper bag to rise.<br>
 When you remove the flame, the warm air in the paper bag cools and 
contracts drawing in air at atmospheric pressure.<br>
 The weight of a paper bag full of air and the bag crunched together, 
 with all the air squeezed out, is the same.<br>
If air in a hot air balloon is heated, it expands and becomes lighter and the balloon is pushed up.<br>
The air left in the balloon is less dense than the surrounding atmospheric air.<br>

<a href="./images/20.1.3.gif">See diagram 20.1.3</a>: Heat flask with hands.<br>
1. Use a flask fitted with a one-hole stopper and glass tube that extends 
 into the flask.<br>
 Put a small amount of oil in the glass tube to trap air in the flask.<br>
 Hold the flask in your hands.<br>
 The oil moves up the tube, because the heat from your hands causes the 
 trapped air to expand.<br>
 If you look carefully note that the oil first moves down, because the 
 heat from your hands first causes the glass of the flask to expand.<br>
 When you cool the flask under the tap, the oil moves down.<br>
2. Fit a hard glass test-tube with a one-hole stopper
 that has a length of glass tubing through it.<br>
 Invert the test-tube so that the end of the tubing is in a container 
 of water.<br>
 Clamp the test-tube in an inverted position so that you can heat it
 with a burner.<br>
 Heat the test-tube and note the bubbles from the end of the tube in
 the container of water.<br>
 Heat has caused the air to expand.<br>
 Cool the test-tube by pouring cold water over it.<br>
 Water moves up the glass tubing as the cooling air contracts.<br>
3. Fit a toy balloon over the neck of a small flask.<br>
 Put the flask in a container of water.<br>
 Heat the water.<br>
 The balloon expands as the heated air in the flask expands.<br>
 Partially inflate a balloon and tie the neck tightly.<br>
 Leave it in a warm place or in the sunlight.<br>
 The balloon becomes fully inflated as the air inside expands when heated.<br>

<a href="./images/20.1.3.gif">See diagram 20.1.3</a>: Heat flask with hands.<br>
1. Air is trapped in the flask by means of a small bead of oil in the 
 glass tubing.<br>
 Gentle heating with the hand will produce a sufficient temperature 
 rise to cause the oil drop to move up the tubing.<br>
 Then plunge the flask first into cold and then into warm (not hot) 
 water.<br>
 In place of the flasks, glass test-tubes and corks with capillary tubing could be used.<br>
2. Use a flask fitted with a one-hole stopper and
 glass tube that extends into he flask.<br>
 Put a small amount of oil in the glass tube to trap air in the flask.<br>
 Hold the flask in your hands.<br>
 The oil moves up the tube, because the heat from your hands causes the 
 trapped air to expand.<br>
 If you look carefully note that the oil first moves down, because the 
 heat from your hands first causes the glass of the flask to expand.<br>
 When you cool the flask under the tap, the oil moves down.<br>
3. Empty a cold bottle of soft drink, put a small
 coin on top of the opening, and firmly grab the bottle with both hands.<br>
 The coin will start to dance up and down, because the cold air in the 
 bottle has become warmed by the hands and it expands to push 
 up the coin.<br>
 When the coin rises some air escapes so the con drops to later rise
 again with further expansion of air.<br>

See: <a href="Comlist.html#PressureH">Pressure</a> (Commercial).<br>
The pressure law states for a gas with constant volume the pressure is proportional to the Kelvin temperature of the gas.<br>
The volume occupied by one mole of gas at STP = 2.24 × 10<sup>-2</sup> m<sup>3</sup>.<br>
<a href="Cvbulb.JPG ">See diagram</a>: Constant volume bulb.<br>
 A constant volume bulb is used to measure the pressure in the sealed sphere.<br>
Hold the bulb in the hand or immerse it in ice water and note change in pressure shown by gauge.<br>
Read the pressure when the bulb is immersed in boiling water, in air at room temperature, and put different gases into the bulb.<br>

See: <a href="Commercial.html#GasH">Gases</a> (Commercial).<br>
See: <a href="Comlist.html#PressureH">Pressure</a> (Commercial).<br>
 Gases are made up of molecules moving randomly at high speeds, in straight 
 lines, in all directions.<br>
 Pressure is a measure of the force per unit area on a surface.<br>
 Pressure = Force / Area where force is in newton, N, and area in square 
 metres, m<sup>2</sup>.<br>
 1 newton / metre<sup>2</sup> = 1 pascal, Pa.<br>
 The pressure of a gas = number of collisions per second per unit area
 × the average impulse per collision for the molecules.<br>
 Standard pressure of one atmosphere, Pa = 1.02 × 10<sup>5</sup> N / m<sup>2</sup>.<br>

See: <a href="Comlist.html#PressureH">Pressure</a> (Commercial).<br>
The equations for Charles's law, Boyle's law and the Pressure law can be combined as follows:<br>
PV / T = constant (depending on the nature and the mass of that gas), or<br>
P1V1 / T1 = P2V2 / T2, where Temperature, T, should be in absolute scale, Kelvin scale, K.<br>

<a href="UNPh12.html#DensityH">Density</a> of gases at STP (Table)<br>
States of matter, at STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure) (0<sup>o</sup>C and 1 atmosphere pressure) are solid (s), or liquid (l), or gas (g), or aqueous solution, (dissolved in water), (aq).<br>
STP refers to the standard conditions used in calculations of the effects of changing temperature and pressure.<br>
IUPAC, set the standard of STP in 1982 as temperature 273.15 K (0<sup>o</sup>C, 32<sup>o</sup>F), absolute pressure 100, 000 Pa (1bar, 0.98692 atm)<br>
Since 1982, STP has been defined as a temperature of 273.15 K (0 °C, 32 °F) and an absolute pressure of exactly 105 Pa (100 kPa, 1 bar).(Wikipedia)
Formerly it was as follows and is still commonly used as the SATP, standard ambient temperature and pressure:<br>
T = 0<sup>o</sup>C or 273.15 K, P = 760 mm Hg, 1 atm, or 101, 325 pascals, Pa (101.325 Nm<sup>-2</sup>).<br>
The combined gas equations can be used to find the volume of a gas at STP, i.e. at 0<sup>o</sup>C and 760 mm Hg pressure.<br>
At STP, one mole of gas occupies 22.4 litres, L.<br>

The universal gas equation combines the three gas laws as PV = nRT, where P = absolute pressure in Pascals, Pa, V = volume gas in cubic metres, m<sup>3</sup>, n = amount of gas in moles,<br>
R is the universal gas constant (gas constant, molar gas constant, ideal gas constant, universal molar gas constant) = 8.314 JK<sup>-1</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup> (8.314510),<br>
 T = thermodynamic temperature, K (0<sup>o</sup>C + 273).<br>
For the Boltzmann constant K<sub>B</sub> or K, N = number of particles, not moles, pV = NK<sub>B</sub>T<br>
For specific gas constant, R<sub>specific</sub> = R / M (molar mass of the gas)<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="20.0.8H"></a>20.0.8 Dalton's law of partial pressures<br>
See: <a href="Comlist.html#PressureH">Pressure</a> (Commercial).<br>
The total pressure of a mixture of gases or vapours in a closed container is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of each gas or vapour, i.e. the sum of the pressures if each gas or vapour alone occupied the space in the closed container.<br>
So each gas or vapour exerts its own pressure regardless of the presence of any other gas or vapour.<br>
When a gas is collected over water, the water molecules in the water vapour contribute to the total pressure over the water.<br>
Total pressure = pressure of gas produced + pressure of water vapour.<br>

See: <a href="Comlist.html#PressureH">Pressure</a> (Commercial).<br>
If the temperature is constant, the mass of gas dissolved at equilibrium is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas.<br>
The solubility of a gas depends directly on the gas pressure.<br>
The concentration of dissolved gas depends on the partial pressure of the gas.<br>
If the pressure is doubled the concentration of the dissolved gas double.<br>
If the temperature remains constant increasing the pressure will increase the amount of dissolved gas.<br>
O<sub>2</sub> (g) &lt;--&gt;O<sub>2</sub> (aq)<br>
Pgas = KC, at constant temperature, where P = pressure, C = concentration and K = the Henry's law constant that is different for every gas, temperature and solvent.<br>
The concentration to pressure ratio is the same when the pressure changes.<br>
C1 / P1 = C2 / P2.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2">Decompression sickness<br>
It occurs when a person experiences a sudden change in atmospheric pressure.<br>
Nitrogen has a low solubility in body fluids at normal atmospheric pressure, but at higher than normal pressure, additional nitrogen molecules diffuse across the alveolar surfaces of the lungs and into the bloodstream and tissues.<br>
If the atmospheric pressure then decreases slowly, the excess nitrogen can diffuse out of the tissues, into the blood, and across the alveolar surfaces without discomfort to the person.<br>
However, if the atmospheric pressure decreases suddenly, nitrogen leaves solution and forms bubbles of nitrogen gas in the blood, tissues, and body fluids.<br>
Small bubbles fuse to form larger bubbles that twist tissues and produce severe pain in joint capsules and causing the person to bend over, "the bends".<br>
Treatment by recompression forces the nitrogen in the tissues back into solution to alleviate the problem.<br>
Then a gradual reduction in pressure allows the nitrogen to diffuse slowly out of the tissues without forming bubbles.<br>
The bends still occurs to scuba divers who have dived too deep or stayed too long at depth, to construction crews working in pressurized surroundings and even to passengers experiencing a sudden loss of cabin pressure in a commercial aeroplane, where a pressure experienced at 2000 metres height is normally maintained.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="20.0.10H"></a>20.0.10 Standard atmosphere<br>
A standard atmosphere (International Standard Atmosphere, ISA), atm, is a hypothetical atmosphere used as a basis of comparing altimeters.<br>
At mean sea level, 1 atm is a pressure of 101.325 Nm<sup>-2</sup> (101, 325 pascals), equivalent to the pressure exerted by a column of mercury 760 cm high at 0<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
The density of a gas is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature provided the pressure remain constant, ρ 2 / ρ 1 = T1 /T2, where ρ = density and T = absolute temperature.<br>
The density of a gas is directly proportional to the pressure, if the temperature remain constant.<br>
The standard atmosphere (USA, 1976 ) has mean conditions at sea level as follows:<br>
Pressure 101325 Pa, Temperature 288.15 K (15<sup>o</sup>C), Density, ρ, 1.225 kg / m<sup>3</sup>, Standard gravity, g = 9.90665 m /s<sup>2</sup>, R = 8.31432 JK<sup>-1</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup>,<br>
 and Composition: N2 (78.084%), O2 (20.9476%), Ar (0.934%),<br>CO2 (0.0314%), Ne (0.001818%), He (0.000524%), CH4 (0.0002%).<br>
However, the international standard atmosphere (ISA) used in international weather data has conditions at sea level pressure 101325 Pa (1 atmosphere) at 15<sup>o</sup>C with lapse rate -6.5<sup>o</sup>C / km and a range of different conditions for specific layers of the atmosphere.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="20.1.01H"></a>20.1.01 Kinetic theory of
 gases<br>
 The temperature of a gas is proportional to the mean kinetic energy
 of translation of the molecules of the gas.<br>
 Two gases at the same temperature have the same mean kinetic energy.<br>
 The pressure of a gas is caused by the impact of its molecules on the 
 wall of the containing vessel.<br>
 Pressure, p = 1 / 3 nmVrms<sup>2</sup>, where p = pressure, m = mass 
 of a molecule, n = number of molecules,<br>
 Vrms = root mean square velocity. p = 1/3 ρ Vrms<sup>2</sup>, where
 ρ = density of the gas<br>

 As the temperature of air in the balloon increases, its volume increases

 A buoyant force, upthrust, is caused by the weight of air displaced

 The density of air inside the balloon is less than the density of the 
 surrounding air.<br>
 In 1783, J. A. C. Charles, in Paris tested a balloon four metres in

The air in the sealed off pump is compressed quickly, so work is done on the air.<br>
With little time for heat transfer to occur, so Q is = approximately 0, and the change in the gas is

 The amount of the air in the flask decreases at the process.<br>

<a href="./images/3.1.4.5ch.gif">See diagram: 3.1.4.5</a>: Burning candle over water.<br>
 1. Fill a trough with water and a float a burning candle in it or attach 
 burning candles to the bottom of the trough.<br>
 Invert a large beaker over the candle or candles.<br>
 Note the level of the water inside the beaker.<br>
 At first, the candle keeps burning and the volume of air inside the 
 beaker increases, caused by the heat from the candle, until some air 
 escapes from below the beaker to form bubbles in the trough.<br>
 The candle flame is extinguished when all the oxygen in the air inside
 the beaker is converted to carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide 
 and some smoke may issue from the wick from the carbon of partially
 oxidized hydrocarbons.<br>
 The level of the water inside the beaker rises to above the original 
 level.<br>
2. Some decrease in volume will be caused by the 
 candle wax burning to form carbon dioxide and water.<br>
 Some of the carbon dioxide will dissolves in the water from the trough 
 and the water vapour formed will condense to form liquid water.<br>
 More air escaped from the jar in the beginning due to large amount 
 of heat released by the two candles.<br>
3. When we ignite the candle, the stearin (purified 
 fatty acids) reacts with oxygen (in excess) to produce carbon dioxide 
 and water.<br>
 The burning causes air currents to shape the candle flame and ensure 
 complete combustion at the bottom and the outer surface of the 
 flame.<br>
 The hot air and products of combustion rise up above the flame.<br>
 When a jar is placed over the burning candle the hot gases in the jar 
 expand and pushing some of the air out of the jar as bubbles in the 
 water.<br>
 As soon as the rim of the jar touches the water, the burning occurs
 in a closed environment.<br>
 Further pressing the jar down into the water helps to retain the hot air in the jar under a pressure greater than atmospheric pressure, and balanced by the pressure of the depth of water.<br>
4. The burning of hydrocarbon in the jar produces 
 more molecules of carbon dioxide and water than the molecules of oxygen 
 consumed in the reaction.<br>
 The increased heat and number of molecules increases the pressure in
 side as a result if not careful some bubbles of gas will escape 
 from the jar.<br>
 Over the time the oxygen in the jar is reduced and conditions for burning 
 are changed.<br>
 Burning under reduced oxygen may not produce carbon dioxide rather 
 a little carbon monoxide.<br>
 When the candle is put out, the temperature decreases followed by also a decrease in pressure due to condensation of water vapour and decreased quantity of air due to thermal expansion during the process of placing the jar on the candle.<br>
 The overall situation is a decrease in pressure inside the jar as compared to atmospheric pressure, so despite water being heavier that air, it is pulled into the jar.<br>
 A negligible amount of carbon dioxide is dissolved in the water during
 30 - 40 minutes, the time the experiment usually takes for 
 performing in a classroom situation.<br>
 If the number of candles is increased in the jar, the heat produced
 is more therefore more air is likely to escape from the jar due to 
 thermal expansion during the process of pacing the jar over them.<br>
 Therefore, more water will rise in the jar with more candles.<br>
5. The nature and quantity of the products will depend upon the composition of candle material.<br>
 However, it is assumed that combustion of saturated hydrocarbons is taking place during burning.<br>
 For the paraffins in the stearin candle, chain length, n = about 30.<br>
 During combustion the solid stearin combines with 3 volumes of oxygen gas to form e volumes of carbon dioxide e gas + 2 volumes of water vapour.<br>
 So the expansion of gases caused by this chemical reaction = 4/3 = 1.3'<br>
 2CH2 (s) + 3O2 (g) --> 2CO2 (g) + 2H2 (g)<br>
However, after the candles are extinguished, drops of water appear on the inside of the jar caused by condensation, so 3 volumes of oxygen have produced 2 volumes of carbon dioxide, a contraction of 2/3.<br>
6. Previously, teachers taught, (and some still teach), that the candle become extinguished, because all of the oxygen under the inverted jar "was used up", i.e. converted to carbon dioxide, and so the decrease in volume of air under the jar after the candles are extinguished indicating the proportion of oxygen in the air.<br>
However, some oxygen remains in the inverted jar as can be demonstrated by testing with yellow phosphorus.<br>
7. The rapid rise of water level in the jar after the candles are extinguished is caused by decrease in pressure as the hot gases cool and the condensation of water vapour.<br>
The amount of condensation of water will depend upon the temperature difference between initial and final temperatures of the air in the jar.<br>
 Since air is above water, therefore saturated water vapour pressure
 is considered in the beginning of the experiment.<br>
Increase in temperature, during the candle burning, will make air unsaturated to accommodate additional water vapours especially produced as a product of burning.<br>
A decrease in temperature over time after the candle is off to the initial temperature will help water vapour to condense.<br>
This condensation will decrease the pressure inside the jar and will help water rise in the jar.<br>
The amount of water vapours condensed during a small change of temperature as usually occurs in this experiment may even be too small to notice.<br>
8. Some teachers believe that all the oxygen is consumed during combustion before the candle is extinguished and the water rises in the jar to fill in vacuum created by consumption of oxygen.<br>
They do not expect the air to escape from the jar as a result of thermal expansion.<br>
They believe that one candle will burn longer in the jar than two candles.<br>
The water level in jars with one or two candles will rise to the same level, because the amount of oxygen in the jars is the same, about 20%.<br>
A little carbon dioxide dissolves in the water during the experiment.<br>
A jar full of carbon dioxide inverted over a trough of water does not completely dissolve after some days.<br>
To study the level of water rise when the candle was put out as soon jar touched the water, a floating candle was used and it was made to sink as soon as jar touched the water in the trough.<br>
It was found that water did rise to some extent, indicating that some air escaped from the jar, because hot air and burning products entered the jar from the candle during the process of placing the jar over the candle.<br>
The oxygen in the jar after the candle was extinguished produced rust in steel wool, reacted with yellow phosphorus to produce white smoke of oxide and supported life of a mouse and insect for a long time.<br>
To test whether the presence of carbon dioxide or lack of oxygen extinguishes the candle, remove the carbon dioxide from the jar by using sodium hydroxide solution in the trough in place of water.<br>
Also, you can spray cotton wool with sodium hydroxide and attach it to the bottom of the jar before it is inverted on the candle.<br>
The candle burning time was almost doubled indicating that it is the presence of carbon dioxide that extinguishes the candle.<br>
When a candle burning under a jar inverted over water in a trough was repeated using two and three candles.<br>
The level of water in the jar increased with an increase in number of candles.<br>
This finding was used to emphasize that more oxygen is escaped from the jar before or during the burning of candles.<br>
However, it is not true that more oxygen was consumed with the increase in the number of candles.<br>

 Insert a piston covered with some glycerine into a 100 mL pump with

 Rotate the piston inside the pump several times to make the glycerine

 This can insulate the air inside the pump from outside completely.<br>
 Open the valve and suck up 60 mL air into the pump.<br>
 Measure the volume of the air with the scale on the pump.<br>
 Close the valve to insulate the air in the pump from outside.<br>
 Push the piston to compress the air volume to about 2 / 3 of the original, 
 i.e. about 40 mL.<br>
 Release the piston that will come back to the original position.<br>
 Pull the piston out with effort to expand the air volume in the pump 
 to about 80 mL.<br>
 Release the piston that will come back to the original position.<br>
 The reason of coming back of the piston is the pressure difference 
 between two sides of the piston.<br>
 At constant temperature, the more the air volume inside the pump is
 compressed, the more pressure it has.<br>
 As the air volume expands, the pressure decreases.<br>
 When the piston is compressed, as the air pressure inside the pump is higher than that of outside, the air inside the pump will push the piston back to its original position.<br>
 When you pull out the piston, the air pressure inside the pump becomes
 less, the atmospheric pressure outside pushes the piston back.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.244H"></a>9.244 Scuba diving and Boyle's law<br>
Swimmers descending more than one metre experience increase in pressure caused by the weight of the overlying water.<br>
The resulting decrease in volume of air spaces causes mild to acute pain in the middle ear, collapse of the auditory tubes and the forcing inwards of the tympanic membranes.<br>
The swimmer can overcome this discomfort by closing the mouth, pinching the nose and exhaling.<br>
This action increases the pressure in the nasopharynx, forces air through the auditory tubes to the middle ear to return the tympanic membrane to its normal position.<br>
When the swimmer returns to the surface, the pressure drops and the air in the middle ear expands, forcing its way out through the auditory tube and into the nasopharynx.<br>
So the swimmer back on the surface normally feels no discomfort unless a blockage occurs in these passages.<br>
Scuba divers breathe air under the same pressure as the level in the water.<br>
Descending more than 10 metres doubles the pressure on a diver.<br>
If the diver takes a full breath of air at this depth and quickly returns to the surface, the volume of air in the lungs will double.<br>
This expansion may cause a tear in the lung wall and even air bubbles in the blood vessels leading to heart attack or stroke.<br>
So scuba divers avoid holding their breath and must exhale when returning to the surface to avoid this over expansion syndrome.<br>

Thermodynamics is about how energy changes from one form to another, the direction of heat flow and how energy does work that can be transferred as heat.<br>
Internal energy does not include chemical energy or nuclear energy.<br>
The value of the internal energy of a system can be changed by the following:<br>

Ice cubes in boiling water<br>
Heat a pot of water until it is boiling steadily.<br>
Add several ice cubes to the pot.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="20.4.03H"></a>20.4.03 Third law of thermodynamics<br>
The entropy of a substance approaches zero as is temperature approaches absolute zero.<br>
Entropy measure the unavailability of the energy of a system to do work.<br>
In any closed system an irreversible change is associated with an increase in entropy.<br>
For an adiabatic process no heat transfer occurs and the entropy remains constant during the process.<br>
Increase in entropy is another way of stating the second law of thermodynamics.<br>
(Adiabatic means neither gain nor loss of heat.)<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="20.4.04H"></a>20.4.04 Isothermal change, internal energy, thermodynamics<br>
An isolated system contains a certain quantity of energy called the internal energy of the system = total kinetic energy and potential energy of all the atoms and molecules in the system that can be transferred as heat.<br>
Internal energy does not include chemical energy or nuclear energy.<br>
The value of the internal energy of a system can be changed by the following: 1. transfer of mass, 2. transfer of heat, 3. work done on or by the system.<br>
In an isothermal change, the temperature remains constant, and PV = a constant.<br>
On a pressure / volume graph an isothermal change is shown as a rectangular hyperbola.<br>
(Isothermal means having the same temperature throughout a process.<br>
The temperature remains constant.)<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="20.4.05H"></a>20.4.05 Adiabatic change, thermodynamics<br>
 Adiabatic means neither gain nor loss of heat.<br>
 In an adiabatic change no heat is received or lost from the surroundings.<br>
 For an adiabatic system with constant mass, the transfer of heat = 0, the change in internal energy = work done and a change in temperature occurs.<br>
 For example, if a piston is raised in a cylinder containing a gas, the volume of the cylinder increases and the temperature of the gas falls as work is done against the rising piston.<br>
On a pressure / volume graph an adiabatic change is always steeper than a rectangular hyperbola, because adiabatic expansion is accompanied by a fall in temperature.<br>
In an adiabatic change, no heat is received from or lost to the surroundings, so there is a transfer of energy into or out of the system in the form of work only, e.g. very rapid expansion of a gas or any process in an insulated container as in a piston.<br>
 Adiabatic change can occur in a container with thermally-insulated walls or where the change occurs in a very short period of time process happens in an extremely short time, so there is little heat exchange with the surroundings.<br>
 In diesel engines, adiabatic heating occurs during the compression stroke with compression ratios &gt; 20: 1 to raise the temperature enough to ignite the fuel.<br>
 For an adiabatic system with constant mass, the transfer of heat = 0, the change in internal energy = work done and a change in temperature occurs.<br>
 For example, if a piston is raised in a cylinder containing a gas, the volume of the cylinder increases and the temperature of the gas falls as work is done against the rising piston.<br>

 Place scrapings from a match head within the combustion chamber of

 A small piece of tissue paper may be ignited instead of the match head

 The working of an ideal reversible engine is shown as the Carnot cycle.<br>
 A gas is contained in a cylinder with a conducting base and nonconducting 
 walls and frictionless piston.<br>
 Stage 1: A constant heat source, temperature T1, heats the conducting
 base and the load on the piston is decreased.<br>
 Heat is taken in.<br>
 Isothermal expansion of the gas at temperature T1 occurs.<br>
 Stage 2: The heat source is removed, the conducting base of the cylinder
 is insulated and the load on the piston is decreased.<br>
 Adiabatic expansion of the gas occurs as the temperature of the gas
 falls to T2.<br>
 Work is done by the gas.<br>
 Stage 3: The conducting base of the cylinder is no longer insulated, it is heated by a constant heat source, temperature T2 and the load on the piston is increased.<br>
 Heat is given out.<br>
 Isothermal compression of the gas at temperature T2 occurs.<br>

 Crooke's radiometer, (Commercial).<br>
<a href="./images/20.4.2.gif">See diagram 20.4.2</a>: Crookes' radiometer.<br>
 The Crookes radiometer was invented by Sir William Crookes in 1873, but he mistakenly thought it measured the pressure of light.<br>
It consists of a paddle wheel of vertical mica paddles with alternate surfaces white or black connected by a vertical spindle in a partly evacuated glass container.<br>
 It spins with the white sides approaching the source of radiation.<br>
 Increasing the radiation increases the speed of turning.<br>
 Maintaining the level of radiation, but decreasing the temperature reverses 
 the direction of rotation.<br>
 Gas molecules move from the cold white side to the warmer black side causing the cold white side to 
 move forward.<br>
Gas molecules hitting the edges of the warmer sides bounce off the paddle with increasing speed causing the slight increase in temperature of the black sides, so these rebound molecules increase in speed.<br>
 Crookes' radiometer is still sold in novelty shops as a "light mill".<br>
The radiometer, a sensitive detector of thermal radiation, has four light mica vanes black on one side and silver on the other, on a common pivot, so they can rotate freely in a horizontal plane.<br>
The glass container is evacuated to a pressure of about 10 mm of mercury.<br>
At this pressure there are still many gas molecules to interact with the vanes and their mean free path is large.<br>
<hr width="100%" size="2">Experiment<br>
This radiometer spins in the opposite direction from what theory predicts: the white side moves forward.<br>
Turn on the light and watch it spin.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="20.4.3H"></a>20.4.3 Maxwell's Demon<br>
Maxwell's Demon, an idea created by James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1874), seems to contradict the second law of thermodynamics.<br>
A box filled with a gas is separated into two halves by a partition with a door in it.<br>
A "demon" opens the door to allow faster than average gas molecules to pass to the left side of the box and slower than average molecules to pass to the right side of the box.<br>
So the left side of the box becomes hotter than the right side and this separation would allow a heat engine to run as heat flows from the hot side to the cold side.<br>
The Maxwell Demon demonstrator consists of a sealed flask containing 5 white and 5 black spheres.<br>
 The balls in the stem of the flask are in the unmixed condition.<br>
 Inverting the flask mixes the balls.<br>
 If the flask is to be inverted again, it is unlikely that the original
 arrangement of balls would return.<br>
 With 5 black and 5 white balls the odds against reproducing the initial 
 array are 252 to 1.<br>
 Rotate the flask in a stem up position to impart a swirling motion to
 the spheres.<br>
 Turn the flask to the stem down position and slowly reduce the rotation 
 rate and the balls will spiral back into the neck.<br>
 With a little practice the initial array is restored.<br>
 The action of the "demon" is caused by the fact that the black spheres
 are constructed so as to rapidly lose momentum.<br>

For an ideal gas, i.e. no attractive forces between its molecules, the volume decreases with temperature down to -273<sup>o</sup>C, called "absolute zero" or 0<sup>o</sup> Kelvin, K.<br>
For monatomic gases, the molar heat capacity cp = 12.5 joule / mole K, so you need 12.5 joules to raise the temperature of a mole of a monatomic gas by 1K.<br>
 In an isothermal change the temperature remains constant.<br>

 Adiabatic expansion occurs when a gas expands quickly, or when a gas

See: <a href="Commercial3.html#VacuumH">Vacuum</a>, (Commercial).<br>
 1. Heat is a form of energy.<br>
 The unit of work and energy is the joule, J (i.e. newton.metre) (James 
 Prescott Joule 1818 - 1889).<br>
 Heat transfer by conduction, convection and radiation, coefficient  of expansion, the joule / calorie<br>
* First law of thermodynamics<br>
 When other forms of energy are converted to heat or when heat is converted  to other forms of energy there is no loss of total energy.<br>
* Second law of thermodynamics<br>
 Heat always flows from hot bodies to cold bodies.<br>
 2. Heat is a form of energy measured in joules, J.<br>
 Heat transfer is the process of transfer of energy from an object to  another, or from a part of an object to another one.<br>
 Heat energy can be transferred by conduction, convention, and radiation.<br>
 The natural flow of heat is from higher temperature towards lower temperature.<br>
 So heat energy spreads out from concentrations at high temperature.<br>
 When you apply heat to one end of a solid conductor, the particles  at that end, e.g. atoms and molecules vibrate more rapidly.<br>
 This energy is passed from particle to particle through the material  by conduction.<br>
 All metals are good conductors of heat, but many liquids and gases are  poor conductors.<br>
 Liquids and gases can transfer heat by convection when hot fluid rises  and is replaced by colder surrounding fluid.<br>
 Heat can be transferred through space as electromagnetic radiation.<br>
 Rough or black surfaces are good absorbers and good emitters of radiation 
 whereas polished or white surfaces are not.<br>

<a href="./images/23.05.gif">See diagram 23.05</a>: Dewar flask.<br>
 A Dewar flask, James Dewar, 1842-1927, Scotland, is a double-walled
 vessel, the space between the walls being a near vacuum.<br>
 Heat cannot be conveyed through the two walls by conduction and the air cannot get into direct contact with the inner wall, so that heat is not conveyed away by convection.<br>
 The outer side and the inner side of the thin walls of the double glass 
 flask have silver surfaces to reduce the loss or gain of heat by 
 radiation.<br>
 The near vacuum between the double walls and the cork or rubber stopper 
 reduces conduction and prevent evaporation.<br>
 The cork or plastic stopper prevents heat transfer by convection at
 the top and the loss of heat by conduction through the bad 
 conductor cork or plastic.<br>
 Also, the case reduces convection.<br>
