<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.2.01">19.2.01</a> Cooking<br>
1. The four basic methods of cooking are as follows:<br>
* Wet heating: boiling, steaming, pasteurization 100<sup>o</sup>C to 120<sup>o</sup>C,<br>
* Dry heating: baking, roasting, up to 250<sup>o</sup>C,<br>
* Hot oil frying, up to 300<sup>o</sup>C,<br>
* Microwave cooking, up to 120<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
2. Cooking breaks down long molecules to smaller molecules that are more easily digested.<br>
 Cooking may also release flavours and destroy unwanted flavours.<br>
 Cooking may also raise temperature so that enzyme reactions can occur.<br>
 If meat is cooked too fast on a high flame the outside becomes scorched 
 and covered with carbon that acts as a thermal insulator so 
 that the meat takes longer to cook thoroughly.<br>
 So slow cooking results in more thorough cooking.<br>
* Braising is done after browning the food in some fat then half immersing
in liquid in sealed pot and cooked slowly.<br>
* Broiling is the same as grilling in England, but in USA it means grilling
food under direct heat source as in an electric oven.<br>
* Caramelizing is browning of sugars in solution when heated above 
150C.<br>
 The sugars breakdown to many compounds, including sugars, and carbon.<br>
 Onions are commonly caramelized.<br>
* Frying is putting food into a bath of hot fat or oil.<br>
 It involves sealing and browning.<br>
 If the temperature does not exceed 180C, the fat or oil used should not
break up or decompose.<br>
 The food should be dry or dipped into flour, bread crumbs or batter.<br>
 Potato is commonly deep fried.<br>
 If a fire occurs, drop in baking soda and cover the pan with a lid.<br>
 At temperature 300<sup>o</sup>C, the wet potato chips sizzle, dry out
and go brown on the outside.<br>
<a name="PoachingH">* Poaching</a> is cooking by simmering in water<br>
 Unlike boiling, the water temperature is kept below boiling point.<br>
 Eggs are commonly poached.<br>
* Roasting is cooking food with dry heat and can be done in an oven
or over an open fire.<br>
 Meat and poultry are commonly roasted.<br>
 Fish and vegetables can also be roasted.<br>
* Saut√©ing and deglazing is briefly cooking food in a shallow pan for
quick sealing and browning of small pieces of food.<br>
However, The Concise Larousse Gastronomique defines "Saute" as to cook meat, fish, or vegetables in fat until brown, using a frying pan (skillet) a saute pan or even a heavy saucepan and "Deglaze" as to heat wine, stock or other liquid together with the cooking juices and sediment left in the pan after roasting or saut√©ing to make a sauce or gravy.<br>
3. Woks are used mainly in Chinese cooking where all the food is first chopped and peanut oil or other oils are added to swirl around to coat the bottom of the wok.<br>
 When the oil starts to smoke, add the chopped food.<br>
 The salt in cooking water increases the osmotic pressure of the water and stops the food losing desirable flavour molecules by diffusion.<br>
 Food cooked in saltwater is no more salty than food cooked in unsalted water, unless you drink the cooking liquid.<br>
4. Cooking time is proportional to the square of the smallest radius of the food rather than its weight.<br>
Experiments<br>
4.1 Taste raw and cooked to note the difference in flavour of different foods raw, cooked without salt, and cooked with salt, rice or wheat flour, banana, peanut, bean curd, onion, beef, fish.<br>
4.2 Try to eat raw potato, raw rice and raw meat!<br>
 Cooking breaks down inedible and indigestible large molecules and fibres to smaller structures that can be eaten and digested.<br>
 Similarly cooking destroys some bad flavours, poisons, bacteria and other organisms that may be harmful if eaten in raw food.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.2.11H">19.2.11</a> Taste, smell, flavour<br>
See: <a href="Comlist.html#Taste">Taste</a>, (Commercial).zzz<br>
Tastes, smells and flavours are usually due to many chemical components. 
 For example, a recent study of the favour of the orange cultivar Kozan in Turkey found 34 components of flavour, including seven esters, two aldehydes, five alcohols, five terpenes, twelve terpenols, and three ketones.<br>
The major flavour components: | <a href="topicIndexE.html#EthylhydroxyhexanoateH">Ethyl 3-hydroxyhexanoate</a> | <a href="topic16f.html#LinaloolH">Linalool</a> | 
<a href="topic16f.html#LimoneneH">Limonene</a> | <a href="topic16f.html#PhellandreneH">Phellandrene</a> | <a href="topic16f.html#TerpineolH">Terpineol</a> |.<br>
 Taste<br>
 The four basic tastes are sweet, sour, bitter and salt, also "umami", the savoury taste of glutamates, monosodium glutamate.<br>
 1. Sweet - Different sugars have different sweetness.<br>
 2. Sour -  Acids always taste sour.<br>
 3. Bitter - Most alkaloids taste bitter, e.g. purgative aloes (<i>Aloe vera</i>) wormwood (<i>Artemisia absinthium</i>) used in the illegal (in some countries) alcoholic drink absinthe, lupulin in hops (<i>Humulus lupulus</i>), used in making bitter beer, amygdalin in bitter almonds 
 (<i>Prunus amygdalus</i>) colocynth in the bitter apple (<i>Colocynthis sp.</i>) quinine in bark of <i>Cinchona sp.</i> and used in tonic water, caffeine in <i>Coffea sp.</i> and used in coffee.<br>
 4. Salt - Most sodium salts and most chlorides taste salty.<br>
 5. Umami - The taste of monosodium glutamate used in Asian cooking and Parmesan cheese.<br>
 The "trigeminal sense" allows us to "taste" chillies and onions.<br>
 Smell - The sense of smell depends on small molecules that can be carried in the air, e.g. from ripening fruit and flowers, but also air from the back of the mouth carry molecules from the food being chewed up to the olfactory epithelium of the nasal cavities, the "after taste".<br>
 Cooked food tastes differently from uncooked food, e.g. uncooked meat is relatively tasteless.<br>
 People who lack the sense of smell are called anosmic, they suffer from anosmia.<br>
 People who lack the sense of taste are called ageusic, they suffer from ageusia.<br>
 Reduced ability to smell is called hyposmia.<br>
 Reduced ability to taste sweet, sour, bitter or salty food is called hypogeusia.<br>
 Flavour - The flavour is the quality perceived by the sense of taste assisted by the sense of smell.<br>
 Experiments<br>
1. Test blindfolded students for their ability to identify food with some students with nose clips or holding their noses:.<br>
 * Bland and tasty foods, e.g. potato crisps.<br>
 * Whole foods and pureed foods.<br>
 * Raw and cooked vegetables.<br>
 Be careful if using raw onions or chillies, because students may be allergic to them.<br>
 * Tomato and monosodium glutamate.<br>
 * Table salt and sugar.<br>
 * Note the difference between olive oil and a similar oil, e.g. safflower oil.<br>
 Then try to identify the oils when blind-folded and the nose pinched.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.2.1H">19.2.1</a> Anatomy and physiology of meat<br>
 1. Meat consists of muscle fibres, connective tissues and fats.<br>
 The muscle fibres largely consist of two proteins, myosin and actin, extended along the fibres and can move past one another, to cause a similar contraction.<br>
 Meat is muscles attached to bones by tendons.<br>
 Muscles contain long protein fibres actin and myosin.<br>
 These fibres slide along each other when stimulated by nerve impulses, which make the muscle shorter and fatter.<br>
 If muscles are used for short, fast bursts of energy, then glucose from the blood provides the fuel.<br>
 If the muscles have to give long sustained activity, then fat provides the energy and in this case another protein, called myoglobin, is needed to help oxidize the fat and provide the energy.<br>
 Myoglobin is a single chain protein of 153 amino acids, containing a haem, (heme), which is the main oxygen carrying pigment of muscle tissues.<br>
 Myoglobin is bright red, so muscles that work a lot are red while those that are used for less regular, sudden movements are pale or even white.<br>
 2. Fibrous tissues that surround the muscles and connect them to the tendons and bones are made from collagen.<br>
 The more collagen in the meat, the tougher it is.<br>
 There are three main types of connective tissue: collagen, reticulin and elastin.<br>
 Collagen is the most abundant and the most important for the cook to appreciate.<br>
 Collagen is a complex molecule made up from three strands that are twisted together rather like a rope.<br>
 Collagen derives its stiffness and strength from the arrangement of these intertwined helices.<br>
 However, if collagen is heated to temperatures above about 60<sup>o</sup>C, the three strands can separate and the material loses its strength.<br>
 Once denatured into single strands, collagen becomes a very soft material, and is given a different name, gelatine.<br>
 You already know that gelatine is a soft, tender, material, since it is used as the basis of all jellies.<br>
 The collagen is mostly found around bundles of muscle fibres and helps to hold them together.<br>
 The muscles are then joined to the bones with yet more sinews (yet more "connective tissue"), which cooks recognize as tough "gristly"  material.<br>
 These sinews are made from the proteins reticulin and elastin.<br>
 Reticulin and elastin can only be denatured and softened by heating for very long times at temperatures above 90<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 3. Muscles consist of bundles of long cells called muscle fibres or myofibrils.<br>
 Resting myofibrils contain two types of proteins actin and myosin arranged side by side.<br>
 The muscle contracts when the actin and myosin proteins slide together like the finger from each hand to form the protein actomysin the presence of calcium ions Ca<sup>2+</sup> powered by the energy-carrying
 molecule ATP, (adenosine triphosphate).<br>
 After an animal is slaughtered, blood circulation stops, and muscles exhaust their oxygen supply.<br>
 Muscle can no longer use oxygen to generate ATP and turn to anaerobic glycolysis, a process that breaks down sugar without oxygen,  to generate ATP from glycogen, a sugar stored in muscle.<br>
 The breakdown of glycogen produces enough energy to contract the muscles, and also produces lactic acid.<br>
 With no blood flow to carry the lactic acid away, the acid builds up in the muscle tissue.<br>
 If the acid content is too high, the meat loses its water binding ability and becomes pale and watery.<br>
 If the acid is too low, the meat will be tough and dry.<br>
 As glycogen supplies are depleted, ATP regeneration stops, and the actin and myosin remain closed in a permanent contraction of  actomysin called rigor mortis.<br>
 4. Freezing the carcass too soon after death keeps  the proteins all bunched together, resulting in very tough meat.<br>
 Individual protein molecules in raw meat are wound in coils, which are formed and held together by bonds.<br>
 When meat is heated, the bonds break and the protein molecule unwinds.<br>
 Heat also shrinks the muscle fibres both in diameter and in length as water is squeezed out and the protein molecules recombine, or coagulate.<br>
 Because the natural structure of the protein changes, this process of breaking, unwinding, and coagulating is called denaturing.<br>
 Most animal muscle is roughly 75% water, 20% protein, and 5% fat, carbohydrates, and assorted proteins.<br>
 Observe the arrangement of bone muscle, tendons and connective tissue is a piece of meat selected for roasting.<br>
 Mature beef should have areas of muscle separated by fat, an arrangement called marbling.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.2.12H">19.2.12</a> Boiling, test the cooking water of boiled vegetables<br>
 Meat cooked in hot water has no roasted flavours, because the temperature does not rise above 100<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 Vegetables with large surface / mass ratios (e.g. spinach) are especially sensitive to loss of vitamins.<br>
 Vitamin C is a most unstable nutrient in neutral and alkaline conditions, and in the presence of oxygen, folic acid may be even more unstable, and thiamine, riboflavin, carotene and niacin are sensitive under certain conditions.<br>
 Nutrient losses increase if large amounts of cooking water are used.<br>
 Cooking for longer times also results in a greater loss of nutrients.<br>
 Experiments<br>
 Test cooking water of boiled vegetables.<br>
 1. Boil green vegetables in water, e.g. spinach brussels sprouts, spring greens.<br>
 Removed the cooked vegetables and filter the cooled cooking water.<br>
 Observe the green colour of the cooking water, because of Œ≤-carotene, vitamin A precursor.<br>
 Test the cooking water for vitamin C with a Vitamin C dipstick.<br>
 2. Put some unpeeled new potatoes into boiling water for different lengths of time.<br>
 Remove them and cut them open.<br>
 Observe the growth with time of a translucent ring from the outside.<br>
 Inside the ring the potato still has an opaque white texture.<br>
 The width of the ring is the distance that has reached a temperature of 60<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 3. Put dry peas in a measuring cylinder and measure  the volume of water needed to fill the cylinder to the 100 mL mark.<br>
 Put the peas in boiling water for 15 minutes boiling.<br>
 Put the boiled dry peas in the measuring cylinder and measure the volume of water needed to fill the cylinder to the 100 mL mark.<br>
 Calculate the percentage change in the volume of the peas.<br>
 4. Use a microscope to observe the characteristic shape of starch grains, e.g. potato, rice, wheat, maize.<br>
 Boil the starch grains until the cells burst and the starch forms a gelatinous mass leaving empty cell wall envelopes "ghosts".<br>
 This gelating action occurs at different temperatures: | barley 51<sup>o</sup>C to 61<sup>o</sup>C | tapioca 52<sup>o</sup>C to 64<sup>o</sup>C
 | pea 57<sup>o</sup>C to 70<sup>o</sup>C | potato 58<sup>o</sup>C. to 66<sup>o</sup>C | wheat 50<sup>o</sup>C to 64<sup>o</sup>C
 | maize (corn) 62<sup>o</sup>C to 70<sup>o</sup>C | rice 68<sup>o</sup>C to 70<sup>o</sup>C |.<br>
 5. Show the effect of the salivary enzyme amylase on raw and boiled starch measured using dipsticks specific for glucose.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.2.13H">19.2.13</a> Mashed potato, pommes pur√©e<br>
 Two types of potato are as follows:.<br>
 1. The floury type with cells that separate and that breakdown easily when cooked, e.g. "King Edward".<br>
 2. The waxy type with cells that are firmly held together when cooked, e.g. "Charlotte".<br>
 Most new potatoes are waxy type.<br>
 Floury types make a mashed potato that is light, fluffy, and thick.<br>
 Waxy types make mashed potato that is thick, smooth and silky textured.<br>
 Floury types contain more starch granules per cell than waxy types and are more dense.<br>
 The cells contain starch granules.<br>
 The cell walls are a network of cellulose held together by hemi-cellulose.<br>
 During cooking, the hemi-cellulose breaks down, the cell walls get weaker, the cells start to separate and break open.<br>
 The starch granules absorb water and expand.<br>
 Many granules are also released from the cells of the floury types.<br>
 Prevent potatoes from absorbing water during cooking, which makes the mashed potato wet, by either cooking them in their skins or first peel then steam them.<br>
 Also, you can cook them at a temperature below the boiling point, leave to cool, then cook again before they are mashed.<br>
 The first cooking activates enzymes, which allow the pectin to react with calcium to make a glue to hold the cells together during the second cooking.<br>
 Mash potatoes so that the cells are opened without breaking the released starch granules to form an unpleasant sticky jelly.<br>
 Experiments<br>
 Use iodine solution to examine slices of floury type and waxy type potatoes.<br>
 Also, examine the starch grains before and after cooking.<br>

 Retention of nutrients may be low, e.g. vitamin C retention in baked apple 40%, thiamine retention in potatoes 41%.<br>
 Baking powders destroy thiamine that needs slightly acid conditions to keep stable during baking.<br>
 Bread loses little nutritional value during baking, but toasting causes loss of protein and vitamins, depending on how much drying out and browning.<br>
 The heating, rolling and flaking processes to manufacture breakfast cereals do not affect protein content, but explosion puffing, e.g. puffed wheat, puffed rice, reduces the nutritive value.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.2.3.1H">19.2.3.1</a> Browning reactions of fruits and vegetables<br>
1. Phenolase browning occurs at the cut surface of light-coloured fruits and vegetables, e.g. apples, bananas, potatoes, where phenols oxidize to orthoquines, which then polymerize to form melanin brown pigment.<br>
The phenolases, the enzymes that catalyse the phenols oxidation, contain copper.<br>
Phenolase are active in the pH 5 to 7 range and can become inactivated below pH 3.<br>
Phenolase browning is an enzymatic catalytic reaction.<br>
Other browning reactions of food are non-enzymatic reactions, e.g. Maillard reaction, caramelization, and ascorbic acid oxidation.<br>
When tissues are damaged, polyphenolic substances from the vacuoles of the plant cells contact the oxidase called phenolase (phenol oxidase enzyme) in the cytoplasm of plant cells and in the presence of oxygen produce substances that protect the plant and favour wound healing.<br>
However, these substances produce a brown coloration.<br>
2. Brownning of the cut surface of fruits and vegetables is caused by polyphenoloxidases enzymes, released by the broken cells, which catalyse the reaction between colourless polyphenols and molecular oxygen to create coloured compounds.
These coloured compounds can react with each to form black-brown melanins.<br>
Cooking and food processing uses procedures to inhibit the action of polyphenoloxidases.<br>
For example cook put freshly peeled potatoes into a pan of water and squeeze drops of lemon juice on to a freshly cut avocado.<br> 
The change from a colourless solution of catechol to coloured benzoquinone can be followed by using a colorimeter.<br> 
If a fruit extract is added to a catechol solution the rate of formation of coloured benzoquinone can be measured. <br>
The faster the rate of increase in absorbance of the reaction mixture, the greater the polyphenoloxidase activity of the fruit extract.<br>
An enzyme extract is adsorbed to filter paper discs.<br> 
These discs initially sink in a hydrogen peroxide solution, but then float to the surface as the oxygen produced gets trapped in the paper fibres.<br> 
The time taken for the discs to rise is measured.<br>
4. Phosphatase enzymes provide the phosphate ions used for many biological processes, e.g. the formation of ATP and nucleotides.<br>
Some phosphatases are specific for a particular substrate, e.g. Glucose-6-phosphatase, but others can produce phosphate groups from many organic substrates.<br>
Experiments<br>
Phenolphthalein phosphate (PPP) is colourless in alkaline solution and free phenolphthalein is a pink colour.<br> 
The amount of enzymatic activity can thus be estimated by the intensity of colour produced from a standard reaction mixture when an alkali such as sodium carbonate solution is added.<br>
The phosphatase enzyme has an optimum pH of around 5 so the pH of the reactions should be kept below 9.2. 
Buffer tablets may be used.<br>
Use duplicates of the investigation so that colorimeter readings for each pair may be compared.<br>
5. Browning can be prevented by the following processes:.<br>
* Immersion in water or dilute salt solution or coating with syrup so that the substrate has no contact with oxygen.<br>
 Concentrated sugar solution also depresses enzyme activity.<br>
 Also, storage in carbon dioxide or nitrogen prevents the browning reaction.<br>
* Boiling or steaming to inactivate the protein enzymes that are denatured by heat.<br>
 Browning does not occur in cooked fruits and vegetables.<br>
* Adding acid to lower the pH, e.g. lemon juice or cream of tartar (potassium hydrogen tartrate, KHC4H4O7.<br>
 Ascorbic acid may also act as an antioxidant to reduce quinones.<br>
* Lower the temperature to depress enzyme activity.<br>
 However, some fruits become brown even when frozen, e.g. banana skin.<br>
* Use sulfur dioxide or sulfites, e.g. sodium sulfite, sodium metabisulfite, that react with quinones formed from phenolic compounds to block further reactions.<br>
 A sulfur dioxide concentration of 10 ppm (10 mg per litre), inhibits phenolase.<br>
 Sulfites are used in the processing of dried fruits, red wine, red and white grape juice.<br>
 However, sulfites may cause medical problems to people who have sulfite sensitivity.<br>
* Dehydration makes phenolase inactive, even in bananas.<br>
 Browning may be a useful process as when plums become prunes, grapes become raisins and green tea leaves become black tea.<br>
* Lemon juice contains two components that can block the browning reaction:.<br>
1. Organic acids, mainly citric acid, with pH &lt; 2, that lower the pH of the apple tissue below the best pH for the action of oxidases.<br>
2. The biological antioxidant vitamin C that is oxidized to colourless substances.<br>
* Test the effects of anti-browning compounds by using cut slices of celeriac or celery.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.2.3.2H">19.2.3.2</a> Non-enzymatic browning, caramelization<br>
Non-enzymatic browning is a chemical process that produces a brown colour in foods without the activity of enzymes.<br>
Caramelization is the oxidation of sugar, a process used extensively in cooking to release volatile chemicals producing the characteristic caramel flavour and brown colour.<br>
The complicated chemical processes that are not fully understood include sucrose inversion to fructose and glucose, condensation to result in the formation of carbon, isomerization of aldoses to ketoses, dehydration, fragmentation reactions and unsaturated polymer formation, production of melanins.<br>
Caramelization temperatures of different sugars include the following: 
Fructose 110<sup>o</sup>C, 
Galactose 160<sup>o</sup>C,
Glucose 160<sup>o</sup>C, 
Maltose 180<sup>o</sup>C, 
Sucrose 160<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
The brown colour may be due to fructose dianhydride and carbon particles.<br>
 Caramel is used as a flavouring and food colouring E150 in candy and Coca Cola and other foods.<br>
The melting point of sucrose is 186<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
The solubility of sucrose is 2.59 g sucrose per g water at 50<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
Be careful!<br>
 "Toffee" burns are very painful and dangerous!<br>
 Wear a full face mask and gloves, because sputtering of hot sugar may occur.<br>
Experiments<br>
 1. Add two measures of sugar to one measure of water.<br>
 Stir and heat in a Pyrex beaker or non-stick deep pot until all the sugar is dissolved.<br>
 Keep heating and adding more sugar until no more can dissolve.<br>
 Remove the heat when the solution has a straw colour.<br>
 Do not allow boiling to occur.<br>
 You can check the temperature of the solution with a special "candy thermometer".<br>
 Pour the hot solution into paper cups and immediately clean the Pyrex beaker or saucepan.<br>
 Leave to cool.<br>
 The glassy solid may be eaten or used in movie sets for imitation glass bottles and windows so that actors are not hurt when hit with a "bottle" when they jump through a "glass window".<br>
 After removing the heat, and while the solution is still hot, add whipped cream and butter to make the French desert "creme brulee", ("burnt custard").<br>
2. Put granulated sugar or glucose in a shallow porcelain-lined evaporating dish or metal pan, volume X10 the volume of sugar / glucose.<br>
 Heat the sugar over an electric stove until it froths up suddenly, immediately turn off the stove or remove the dish or pan from the stove.<br>
 Add water to bring the dark brown viscid mass to the consistency of a heavy syrup.<br>
 The product will be insoluble in water if more than 15% of the original weight of the sugar is lost.<br>
 If the caramel dissolved in water is cloudy, carbonization has occurred so some of the sugar has been reduced to carbon.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.2.3.3H">19.2.3.3</a> Non-enzymatic browning, the Maillard reaction<br>
The Maillard reaction, first discovered by Louis Camille Maillard, France, in 1912, refers to the chemical reactions between:<br>
1. the aldehydes and ketones from reducing sugars, and<br>
2. proteins or amino acids, e.g. asparagine, to form more than 200 mainly brown new chemicals with strong, distinctive smells and tastes.<br>
The reactive carbonyl group of the sugar interacts with the amino group of the amino acid.<br>
The type of amino acid decides the many flavour compounds produced and these compounds may then breakdown to form more new flavour compounds, e.g. the aroma compound 2-acetylpyrroline C6H9NO in toast.<br>
The Maillard reactions produce caramel candies made from milk and sugar, the browning of bread in toast, cakes, stir fries, malting of barley to give the colour of beer, chocolate, roasted coffee beans, maple syrup, lightly roasted peanuts, colour of condensed milk, potato chips and baked potatoes.<br>
The carbonyl group of the sugar reacts with the amino group of the amino acid, producing water and N-substituted glycosylamine that undergoes Amadori rearrangement to form ketosamines, which react further to produce various short chain products, brown nitrogenous polymers and melanoidin.<br>
The protein of meat congeals when heated.<br>
If it is further heated after it has congealed, its combination is broken and it becomes a compound called melanoidin with a chemical amino carbonyl reaction to oxygen in air and others.<br>
Melanoidins are polymers, the coloured final products of the Maillard reaction, but their chemical structures are not known.<br>
They are possibly furans and pyrroles formed by cross-linking of degraded sugar products with lysine and arginine in meat protein.<br>
They occur in coffee, cocoa, bread, malt, honey, sweet wine, and dark beer and cause the colour, viscosity and flavours in cooked and processed foods.<br>
 Melanoidins have antioxidant activity and antimicrobial activity, but the processes are not understood.<br>
Melanoidin is light brown and has the good smell of grilled meat.<br>
However, melanoidin is easy to volatize, so its smell disappears if it is heated for a long period of time with low heat.<br>
It is why cooks grill meat for a short period of time over a high flame.<br>
Over 200<sup>o</sup>C carbonization occurs and the protein component causes a bad smell.<br>
Pentose sugars react more than hexoses, which react more than disaccharides.<br>
Different amino acids produce different amounts of browning.<br>
The temperature of meat in a microwave oven is never above 100<sup>o</sup>C, so no maillard reaction can occur.<br>
Cooks may "pre-brown" the surface of meat before cooking it in a microwave oven.<br>
Sausages should be cooked at 120<sup>o</sup>C -15<sup>o</sup>C to maximize the Maillard reaction and produce brown, not black, cooked sausages.<br>
Experiments<br>
 1. Make toast from white bread and brown bread or wholemeal bread.<br>
 Put equal thickness slices of white bread and brown bread or wholemeal bread in each side of a toaster.<br>
 Turn on the toaster and note the time taken for each slice to start to burn.<br>
 The brown bread or wholemeal bread slice burns faster than the white bread slice, because the white bread contains less sugar and protein for the Maillard reaction.<br>
 If the white bread slice is really white it may reflect more radiation from the toaster than darker slices.<br>
2. Make caramel confectionery.<br>
 Boil together sugar and milk or butter until the solution turns brown.<br>
 You can check the temperature of the solution with a special "candy thermometer".<br>
 To make toffee, heat the solution to 160<sup>o</sup>C, add baking soda and vinegar to make honeycomb toffee.<br>
 Leave to cool.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.2.8.1H">19.2.8.1</a> Roasting meat<br>
 When muscle fibres are heated above about 40<sup>o</sup>C the proteins start to denature.<br>
 In muscle proteins, which are extended along the muscle fibres, this change of shape involves the proteins coiling up.<br>
 This coiling process inevitably causes some contraction of the muscle.<br>
 Muscles contract during cooking so pieces of meat contract along the direction of the muscle fibres.<br>
 When the protein molecules are denatured, the muscles contract so the meat becomes harder.<br>
 The meat will be tough.<br>
 The cooking time should be long enough to degrade the connective tissue present in the meat, without toughening the muscle proteins.<br>
 The toughening occurs in two stages.<br>
 The first stage is caused by the muscle proteins that are extended along the muscle fibres contracting into coils as they denature.<br>
 The pieces of meat should be getting thinner during this stage as the fibres contract.<br>
 The second stage is the coagulation of the now denatured muscle proteins into lumpy, knotty masses.<br>
 There should be a much greater degree of toughening in this stage, but no noticeable changes in the shape of the pieces of meat.<br>
 Meat is roasted to 1. to make it tender to eat 2. to give it a roasted flavour 3. to kill any harmful bacteria 4. to create an acceptable warm temperature for eating when fats are still liquid.<br>
 Low temperature roasting.<br>
 Most cooks first brown the meat at a high temperature to seal in the meat juices during cooking before letting it cook through at a lower temperature.<br>
 High meat temperature makes the meat muscle contract, forcing liquid out.<br>
 However, cooking at less than 70<sup>o</sup>C can produce tender meat before the meat is browned on the outside.<br>
 Slow cooking for a long time at a low temperature causes collagen in the meat to breakdown into gelatine and the meat fibres to shrink and release the meat juice to form a gravy.<br>
 The fibres separate easily and are tasty.<br>
 The high temperature surface searing of the meat following the slow cook creates lots of aroma molecules when the ribose and the amino acids released from the meat react together and these add to the rich flavour by the Maillard reaction.<br>
 This final heating also kills off any bacteria that may have survived the slow cooking.<br>
 To retain moisture, "rest" the meat after cooking so that as meat muscle fibres cool and widen, they hold on to more juice.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.2.8.2H">19.2.8.2</a> Observe roasting meat<br>
 The meat consists mainly of three materials: water, proteins and fat.<br>
 When a strong source of heat is applied to the surface of the meat, the protein coagulates and aggregates to form crust, possibly the result of the Maillard reaction as in the formation of crust on bread.<br>
The presence of heat and water, will make the collagen, (the proteins present in meat), degrades to form a gelatine.<br>
 This the reason why the meat is removed and this brown crust appears at surface.<br>
 However, if the meat is warmed too long, the evaporation of the water associated to the coagulation of the other proteins in the surface, will have for inverse effect to dry and harden the meat.<br>
 It is necessary here all the art and the experience (experiment) of the cook to find the equivalence completed between these two opposite phenomena.<br>
 The chemistry of the browning of meat is still the subject of disagreement and further research.<br>
 Some chemists say that the Maillard reaction occurs when the denatured proteins on the surface of the meat recombine with the sugars present.<br>
 The combination creates the "meaty" flavour and changes the colour, the browning reaction.<br>
 When meat is cooked, the outside reaches a higher temperature than the inside, triggering the Maillard reaction and creating the strongest flavours on the surface.<br>
 As many as six hundred components have been identified in the aroma of beef.<br>
 However, if the Maillard reaction is strictly the reaction between an amino and a reducing sugar, there are not many reducing sugars in meat, so the browning of meat may be due more to the breakdown of tetrapyrrole rings in myoglobin, the muscle protein.<br>
 During roasting, different changes occur at different temperatures:.<br>
 40<sup>o</sup>C Red muscle proteins denature, meat is still red.<br>
 55<sup>o</sup>C to 60<sup>o</sup>C Red muscle proteins coil and shrink.<br>
 Water bound to protein starts to flow.<br>
 The myosin molecules start to shrink and squeeze out fluid from the muscle cells.<br>
 Shrinking fibres makes the meat firmer.<br>
 60<sup>o</sup>C to 65<sup>o</sup>C Produces "rare meat" that is pink and juicy.<br>
 Muscle proteins start coagulating.<br>
 Collagen begins to denature and breakdown to form gelatine, which dissolves in water.<br>
 65<sup>o</sup>C to 70<sup>o</sup>C Produces grey protein.<br>
 Water bound to protein stops flowing.<br>
 Kills bacteria on the surface of the meat.<br>
 These bacteria may be harmless even if they cause meat to spoil.<br>
 The food poisoning bacteria <i>Salmonella</i> and <i>Escherichia coli</i>, (<i>E. coli</i>), are killed above 68<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 However, minced meat may have surface bacteria mixed throughout the meat, so all the meat should reach that temperature 80<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 This produces "well done" meat that is brown grey and dry tough meat.<br>
 90<sup>o</sup>C Collagen turns into gelatine.<br>
 100<sup>o</sup>C to 120<sup>o</sup>C Roast and fried flavours and brown colours form as proteins and carbohydrates breakdown into smaller sugar  molecules and aldehydes and react with amino acids sulfur gives agreeable aromas so cooks add garlic or onions, because of their high sulfur content.<br>
 The meat smell is because of the molecule bis-2-methyl-3-furyl-disulfide.<br>
 Similar reactions gives the colour and flavour to bread crust, toast, biscuits and caramel toffee.<br>
 All these reactions are called the Maillard reaction, browning reaction, and they occur at above 140<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 Caramelization of sugars occurs at about 150<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 Above 200<sup>o</sup>C, carcinogenic molecules may form in barbecued meat.<br>

 Collagen is an insoluble fibrous protein in connective tissue, e.g. tendons, skin, bone.<br>

 Cut the meat and tendons into small pieces, and cover with water, heat to boiling and leave to simmer.<br>

 After each removal of water replace with 50 mL of boiling water.<br>

 Collagen in meat and tendons heated to above 60<sup>o</sup>C changes from its triple stranded helical form into a single stranded form, called gelatine.<br>
 Gelatine is soluble in water so its concentration increases as more collagen denatures during simmering.<br>
 When cold, high concentrations of gelatine molecules aggregate together in a loose gel or jelly.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.2.6H">19.2.6</a> Meat treatments<br>
 1. Marinades are made of acid, oil, and herbs.<br>
 The acid is to denature the proteins and open the meat structure for flavour to enter.<br>
 Marinades work best on meats that are not too dense or where the meat is cut into pieces.<br>
2. Salting meat, brining, adds moisture to the meat through osmosis, because the meat's cell fluids are less concentrated than the salt water.<br>
 Water leaves the muscle cells and salt flows in to dissolve fibre proteins and concentrate the cell fluids so water is attracted back into the meat.<br>
 So salting meat adds both salt and water to the meat muscle.<br>
 Not all the water is squeezed out by cooking, because of the added water.<br>
3. Many flavour or aroma molecules cannot dissolve in water, but can dissolve in fat.<br>
 Muscles that are used often consume the stored fat, and so the meat from these muscles has little fat.<br>
 Older the animals have fat energy reserves in their muscles.<br>
 Meat with white streaks of fat is called marbled and gives beef with the best flavour.<br>
 Ageing allows enzymes in the muscle cells to breakdown the overlapping proteins, which makes the meat tender.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.2.7.3H">19.2.7.3</a> Microwave radiation<br>
 1. Microwaves are a form of high frequency radio waves similar to the waves used by AM and FM radio.<br>
 Microwaves enter from the outside of food losing about half their energy every 3 cm.<br>
 Microwaves are reflected by metals so the walls of the microwave oven are made of stainless steel or epoxy coated stainless steel, so that the microwaves can bounce around the inside and not escape into the kitchen.<br>
 Food is usually heated on a revolving turntable to produce an even heating and avoid hot spots and cold spots.<br>
 The holes in the steel door are too small to let the microwaves pass through.<br>
 Microwaves are transmitted by paper, glass and some plastics that do not absorb microwave energy and do not become hot.<br>
 Microwaves are absorbed by food containing moisture.<br>
2. Microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum is from frequency 300 MHz, wavelength 1 m, to 300 000 MHz, wavelength 1 mm.<br>
 Australia and UK, microwave ovens operate at 2450 MHz (Class B / Group 2, ISM equipment Standard CISPR11), wavelength 12 cm.<br>
 In other places, the microwave oven wavelength may be 12.24 cm.<br>
 This is a lower frequency and lower energy than ionizing radiation.<br>
 For safety reasons, when the microwave door is opened, switches must cut the power.<br>
 The power flux density of microwave radiation should not exceed 50 W / M<sup>2</sup> at any point 5 cm or more from the external surface of the oven.<br>
The inside of a microwave oven is coated with metal that acts like a Faraday cage and reflects the microwaves (radio waves).<br>
3. Microwave radiation is generated in an electronic tube called a magnetron.<br>
 High voltage emits electrons from a heated cathode that are diverted by magnets to spin in a circular orbit causing metal plates to resonate and emit microwaves to be conducted into the interior space of a microwave oven (or connected to a radar transmitter).<br>
 The patterns of more intense radiation can be seen by placing thermal paper used for thermographic imaging at different heights in the microwave oven.<br>
 However, the same thermal paper placed on the turning turntable, (carousel), shows a more equal distribution of the radiation.<br>
4. Water molecules are electric dipoles with a positive charge at one end and a negative charge at the other end, so they spin when they 
 align with the alternating electric fields in the microwave oven.<br>
 However, a block of dry ice is not melted in a microwave oven, because the carbon dioxide molecule is not a dipole.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.2.7.2H">19.2.7.2</a> Microwave cooking<br>
 Microwave cooking occurs, because water is a strong absorber of microwaves, so the water in food boils and turns to steam.<br>
 In a normal oven, a range of black body radiation is generated, but only some longer sections of this radiation are absorbed by food.<br>
 The radiation penetrates the surface of the food for about one wavelength for infrared heat radiation &lt; 1 / 10 mm.<br>
 Only the outside of the food is directly affected and the inside of the food is heated by conduction.<br>
 The 12 cm wavelength microwaves penetrate deeper into the food.<br>
 Avoid exploding food, e.g. tomatoes, apples, by cutting into them before microwave cooking.<br>
 Also avoid dry food with spikes or sharp corners, e.g. small pieces of sweet potato or broccoli, because electrical arcing may occur between the spikes or corners to cause charring of the food.<br>
 Elevate the cooking pan in the microwave oven to allow more bounce of microwaves up from the floor of the microwave oven and get more even cooking.<br>
 Microwaves are not used for defrosting, because ice has few free molecules of water to be excited by the microwaves.<br>
Microwave ovens do not heat food by operating at a special resonance of water molecules in the food.<br>
A microwave oven could operate at many frequencies.<br>
The 22 GHz resonant frequency of isolated water molecules has a wavelength too short to penetrate common foodstuffs to useful depths.<br>
The typical oven frequency of 2.45 GHz was chosen partly due to its ability to penetrate a food object of reasonable size.<br>, 
Microwave ovens do not cook food from the inside out, because 2.45 GHz microwaves can only penetrate approximately 1 cm into most foods.<br>
The inside portions of thicker foods are mainly heated by heat conducted from the outer portions.<br>
Microwave ovens cannot cause cancer, because as microwave radiation is non-ionizing radiation.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2">Do microwaves make food radioactive?<br>
 The energy of a microwave photon in a microwave oven is 0.00001 eV, but the minimum ionization energy of common chemical substances is about 0.01 eV, so microwave ovens do not cause chemical changes from radiating food.<br>
 Photons in an conventional infra-red oven are much higher energy, but the energy required to change a nucleus / make something "radioactive" is many powers of ten higher.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.2.7.1H">19.2.7.1</a> Microwave containers<br>
 Microwave cooking containers should not absorb the radiation, so they should be made from material with low polarity, i.e. low dielectric constant and low dissipation factor at 2450 MHz.<br>
 The material should be stable at high temperature and have good resistance to oil vapour, e.g. polystyrene and certain glass.<br>
 Never use metal containers or plates decorated with metal leaf in microwave ovens, because microwave cannot pass through metal and are reflected to damage the magnetron.<br>
 Remove meal foil packaging and twisted ties or tags.<br>
 Do not use dishes with metallic rims, cups with glued-on handles, delicate glassware, cut glass vases, jars with metal lids.<br>
 However, you can use metal foil to protect food that might overcook in some areas.<br>
 Do not cook in plastic food storage bags, because they may melt.<br>
 However, "GLAD WRAP" may be used to cover dishes, but do not remove it immediately after cooking.<br>
 Do not use brown paper bags or newspaper, because they contain metallic impurities that may cause blue spark arcing and damage the oven.<br>
 Do not put mercury thermometers in the microwave oven.<br>
 Do not put a wet cat in the microwave oven.<br>
 Use containers labelled "microwave oven safe".<br>
 Use shallow round dishes, because microwaves penetrate only 2 to 3 cm into most food.<br>
 Food in the corners or dishes with corners will receive more energy and probably overcook.<br>
 Arrange food containers in a ring at outside of the rotating turntable.<br>
 Sometimes it pays to put the container containing thin food on top of another container on the turntable to get more bounce of microwaves through the food.<br>
 Remember that if food is not cooked through, e.g. poultry, then bacteria may remain unharmed inside.<br>
 Examples of microwave cooking containers:<br>
* "Starmaid" baking dish, plastic, 1 litre with lid, 190 mm √ó 170 mm √ó 68 mm.<br>
* "D√©cor Thermoglass", for conventional ovens and microwaves, with microwave safe lid with a steam release vent, 1 litre.<br>
* Microsafe milk heating jug, "Microsafe" jug has cone-shaped lid if it boils, the milk flows up though the cone, safely back into the jug.<br>
* Melamine crockery, green, virtually unbreakable, dishwasher safe.<br>
Not suitable for microwave oven, plate, 18 mm diameter.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.2.7.4H">19.2.7.4</a> Superheating in a microwave oven<br>
When tap water is heated on a stove top, the maximum superheating is 100.75<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 However, in a microwave oven, superheating temperatures of 105<sup>o</sup>C to 110<sup>o</sup>C can occur.<br>
 The microwave oven heats the water directly and the container indirectly, the opposite of what happens when heating a container of water on a stove.<br>
 In the microwave oven the water is not heated near the beaker surface where nucleation is most likely to occur.<br>
 Evaporation occurs only at the water surface and is not fast enough to cool the bulk water.<br>
 There is much less superheating in plastic cups, because water does not wet plastic and many more nucleation sites are available for boiling.<br>
 It is dangerous to put a cup of still water in the microwave oven,, because when you try to remove the cup nucleation may occur and the water boils, forms bubbles and steam, and may scold your hand.<br>
 To avoid the delayed eruptive boiling of liquids after cooking, leave to stand for at least 20 seconds before removing food or liquids from the microwave oven to allow for some cooling and more even distribution of heat.<br>
Also, if a plastic fork or tea bag is placed in the liquid before the microwave oven is turned on, they provide nucleation sites for boiling to occur, so no superheating.<br>
 Experiments<br>
 1. Test a container for potential microwave oven use.<br>
 Fill a one cup glass measure with water and put it in the microwave oven alongside the container to be tested, e.g. a ceramic dish.<br>
 Heat for on high for 60 seconds.<br>
 If the container is microwave oven safe, it will remain cool, but the water should be hot.<br>
 However, you cannot use this test on plastic containers that must be labelled microwave "oven safe".<br>
 2. Cook a potato for 2 minutes then cut it open to see the translucent areas finger-like regions extending from the outside where the 
 potato has been heated above 60<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 This show that microwave ovens do not provide a uniform density of microwave energy.<br>
 So "hot spots" and "cold" spots may exist in microwave ovens, unlike the conventional oven.<br>
 This phenomenon is the reason cooks suggest leaving food cooked by microwaves to "stand" for some time after cooking to allow the temperature to equalize in the food.<br>
 3. Compare popcorn cooked in the microwave with popcorn cooked on the conventional stove.<br>
 Use the same number of corn (maize) grains and later count the number of unpopped grains.<br>
 Carefully open popcorn bags away from your face!.<br>
 4. Do not put sealed tins or glass jars in a microwave oven, e.g. babies bottles fitted with a screw cap.<br>
 Remove food from tin cans.<br>
 If boiling liquids in a microwave oven use a wide moth container.<br>
 Also, puncture skins of potatoes, apples, sausages and oysters to allow steam to escape.<br>
 Food with a high fat content, e.g. sausage roils, may catch fire if overcooked.<br>
 5. Eggs cooked in the microwave oven.<br>
 Eggs may explode, so avoid exploding food by cutting into eggs before microwave cooking.<br>
 Egg yolk contains fat so tends to cook more quickly than egg white.<br>
 Even out of the shell, eggs may explode in the microwave, because rapid heating causes a build-up of steam, so before cooking puncture egg yolks and whites.<br>
 6. To observe the effect of the wavelength of microwaves, take out the turntable and put a one cup glass measure with water and a long stick of uncooked spaghetti.<br>
 Heat at high for one minute.<br>
 The spaghetti will have an uncooked area every 12 cm.<br>

 Alginic acid (alginate, algin C6H8O6, anionic polysaccharide, from brown algae "Sphereification" is a method of cooking invented by Spanish chefs whereby
juices are mixed with alginates (alginic acid), usually sodium alginate, then added drop by drop to calcium chloride solution.<br>
 The calcium salt causes rapid gelling of the outer thickness of the drop by electrostatic cross linking so a soft bead of juice is formed with a liquid centre.<br>
 The beads are called pearls, spheres, "ravioli".<br>
 The idea is that the beads can be easily crushed by the teeth to "explode" and release intensive taste substances.<br>
 The technique has been used for many juices, e.g. green tea, peach, liquidized olives.<br>
 Sodium alginate is also used in medicines to treat oesophageal reflux, e.g. Gaviscon.<br>
 Experiments<br>
To make gel snakes, dissolve in 100 mL water 2g alginic acid sodium salt and 1g calcium chloride, add food colouring and use a syringe to squirt the alginic acid solution into calcium chloride solution to form gel snakes.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.3.5H">19.3.5</a> Water use<br>
 Use hot water to free stuck screw top lid.<br>
 Use hot water to melt congealed grease in a blocked sink, then use a plumber's suction cup.<br>
 Use ice water inside + hot water outside to free glasses stuck together.<br>
 Use soapy water to store used steel wool and prevent it from rusting.<br>
 Use water, cold water, to remove dried blood stains.<br>
 Use water that eggs have been boiled in, to clean silverware.<br>
 Avoid hot foods in refrigerator that produce steam that forms frost.<br>
 Clean toaster with brush to not damage the element.<br>
 Use cold water after cooking to prevent perish of pressure cooker rubber seal.<br>

 Lemon juice is used to stop fish smells and refrigerator smells, remove kettle "fur", and clean copper and stainless steel kitchen ware.<br>
 The juice is acidic, and the stain or smell may be acid soluble.<br>
 Lemon juice contains ascorbic acid, vitamin C, an active reducing agent, i.e. electron donor, that can reduce molecular oxygen.<br>
 If the stain is reduced by ascorbic acid to a substance that is not coloured, the lemon juice bleaches the stain.<br>
 The skin of lemons contains oils, e.g. lemon oil.<br>
 The stain may be soluble in the oil.<br>
 Most stains are because of organic chemicals that more soluble in the organic compounds in lemon juice then in water.<br>
 Lemon juice may convert the stains into substances that are more soluble in water or the lemon juice.<br>
 12. Absorbent powder, e.g. salt or talc.<br>
 Sprinkle on spillage, leave overnight, then vacuum off.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="19.4.2H">19.4.2</a> Dyes with a mordant<br>
 A mordant is a substance that enables a dye or stain to become fixed to a fabric or tissue.<br>
 If you cannot dye a fabric directly, use a mordant that combines with the dye and forms an insoluble "lake" in the fibres.<br>
 A lake is a pigment formed by interaction of a dye and a "base" to metallic salts, oxides and hydroxides.<br>
 Mordants are hydroxides of aluminium, chromium and iron.<br>
 Experiments<br>
 1. Heat white cotton fabric for 10 minutes in a dilute solution of ammonium sulfate.<br>
 Then put it in dilute ammonia solution for 5 minutes.<br>
 Rinse the fabric in clean water and hang it up to dry.<br>
 Study the effect of the mordant by boiling the mordanted and unmordanted pieces of cotton in methylene blue solution for 5 minutes.<br>
 Rinse and dry.<br>
 Compare the colour of the fabrics.<br>
 2. Aluminium hydroxide, Al(OH)3, is a porous substance that can attach to fabrics and absorb dyes.<br>
 The aluminium salt hydrolyses to form hydroxide.<br>
 Dissolve 30 g of potassium alum (alum, Al2(SO4)3.K2(SO4).24H2O, and 7 g of cream of tartar (potassium hydrogen tartrate) in warm water, then add to 4.5 L of soft water warmed to 30<sup>o</sup>C and stir well.<br>
 Very slowly add 120 g of evenly wetted wool, then heat to boiling while turning the wool to ensure even mordanting.<br>
 This process can take up to one hour.<br>
 After boiling point has been reached reduce the heat and let the mixture simmer for a further hour.<br>

C3H7NO2S.<br>
 The disulfide bonds that give proteins their macroscopic structure can be split at room temperature and slightly alkaline pH by the action of sulfides or mercaptans.<br>
 A reducing agent converts the (-S-S-) bonds to (-SH) groups.<br>
 The hair is combed to straighten and to wave it.<br>
 An oxidizing agent restores the (-S-S-) bonds to create straight hair or a "permanent wave".<br>
 Hairdressing salons use thioglycollic acid in a pH buffer and a cuticle softener to make the internal structure of the hair floppy.<br>
 This reaction produces the smell of rotten eggs from hairdressing salons!<br>
 After combing and setting the wet hair, the hairdresser neutralizes the thioglycollic acid with hydrogen peroxide so that new disulfide bonds form to keep the hair in the new shape.<br>

 1. Fire retardant paints contain substances that decompose on heating to give gases that do not support combustion, e.g. phosphates, tungstates, borates and carbonates.<br>
 Some of these substances fuse on heating to give a glass-like layer on
the surface.<br>
 Other substances are not flammable, e.g. silicones, chlorinated resins, 
 mineral powders.<br>
 Although water based plants may be non-flammable before use, they may become flammable when painted on a surface and dried.<br>
2. Anti-fouling paints used in marine construction may contain inorganic poisons, e.g. Cu and Hg salts, or organic molecules, e.g. entachlorophenol or organo-tin groups in the polymer.<br>
 The later decompose to non-toxic inorganic tin on release into the sea water.<br>
3. Fluorescent paints absorb ultraviolet radiation and re-emit it as visible light when irradiated.<br>
 They contain zinc and cadmium sulfides, and organic dyes.<br>
4. Phosphorescent paints are irradiated with ultraviolet light and continue to glow in the dark after the irradiation has stopped.<br>
 Phosphors may include ZnS (green, yellow, orange) CuS and SrS (bluish) to other salts to change colour.<br>

 Water with a certain amount of a preservative agent added can prolong the life of cut flowers.<br>
 Preservative agents usually contain the following:<br>
 1. Nutritious substances: Sucrose and oxime are usually used.<br>
 Both serve as source of energy and bring stomas to shut up to weaken transpiration.<br>
 2. Bactericide: Silver nitrate, copper (II) sulfate or sodium hypochlorite can be used.<br>

Perfumes (fragrances) are essential oils usually concentrated in the petals of flowers that may be extracted by liquid fat, ethanol steam distillation and vacuum distillation for more sensitive oils and supercritical solvents, e.g. carbon dioxide.<br>
 The underarm smell is a mixture of many "notes" (types of smells) mainly isovaleric acid, 5-andost-16-en-3-one and 5-andost-16-en-3-ol, also 4-ethyloctanoic acid, the goat smell.<br>
 The banana scent is isoamyl acetate.<br>

 A single hair may support a 80 g weight and wet hair can carry 1/3 of its weight in water.<br>
 Women's hair has a growing phase of 6 years and reaches 70-80 cm.<br>
 Men's hair has a growing phase of 4 years and reaches 40-50 cm.<br>
 The black colour of hair is caused by melanin pigment, but redheaded people also have an iron-based pigment.<br>
 Old men sometime produce baby hair, called lanugo.<br>
 A change in humidity twists in hair that can be used in novelty "weather houses" to predict changes in the weather.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">In hair, the hydrogen bonds within individual helices of keratin, and disulfide bridges between adjacent helices, give strength and 
 elasticity.<br>
Water can disrupt the hydrogen bonds, making the hair limp, but when the hair dries, new hydrogen bonding gives hair the shape of the curler.<br>
 Hair straightening treatments, permanent wave, permanent crease solutions give new disulfide bridges between the helices.<br>
 Hair contains keratin protein chains in a protein matrix.<br>
 Hairstyles depend on the frictional forces between hairs, which can be altered with setting and styling lotions.<br>
 This increases the friction between straight hairs that combined with the surface tension that drags hairs together makes combing wet straight hair a difficult task.<br>
 However, with very curly hair, as seen in Papua New Guinea and Africa, water relaxes the hair structure and reduced friction between hairs, so the hair can be straightened.<br>
Keratin, C47H77N13O15 is a fibrous protein occurring in hair, wool, feathers, hooves and horns, imbedded in a matrix that makes them strong and elastic.<br>
 The proteins contain sulfur and are held together by disulfide bonds.<br>
 Sulfides at slightly alkaline pH can split disulfide bonds between keratin
molecules.<br>
 The solution is buffered with thioglycollic acid then neutralized with hydrogen peroxide so that it sets again with hydrogen sulfide given off.<br>
 The hydrogen sulfide causes the strange smell coming from women's hairdressing salons where "permanent waves" are produced.<br>
 Hydrogen peroxide bleaches melanin in hair and softens the hair cortex, thus weakening it.<br>

 Sunburn<br>
 After sun tips<br>
 Take a cool shower.<br>
 The saltwater droplets can magnify UV rays and dehydrate your skin.<br>
 Use the beach shower or take a washcloth and bottle of tap water with you to remove that salt.<br>
 1. Moisturize body and face, because salt and sun dry out the skin.<br>
 After a shower and drying off, moisturize the skin from top to toe.<br>
 2. Apply a nourishing lip product to soothe chapped and sunburnt lips.<br>
 3. Sun, sea water and chlorine can damage your hair.<br>
 Use a lightweight, water-resistant UV defence mist or broad-spectrum product to protect the hair.<br>
 Apply a leave-in treatment or mask after shampooing.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">The facts on sunburn<br>
 Symptoms include:<br>
 1. Changes in skin colour (pink, red, even purple).<br>
 2. Skin feels hot, is painful and swollen.<br>
 3. Skin is blistered and peeling.<br>
 No matter how mild, sunburn can cause irreversible skin damage.<br>
 The long term effects of sunburn can include premature wrinkling and an increased risk of skin cancer, including the potentially deadly melanoma.<br>
 Depending on the severity, it can take a day or several weeks for skin to heal after being burned.<br>
 Time and patience are the only cures, but medical attention may be required in more serious cases.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Sunburn treatment<br>
 Milder sunburns can be treated at home and the following may help skin
recover faster:<br>
* Apply cool or cold compresses or bathe burnt skin in cool water.<br>
*. If it is not too painful, apply a moisturizer to help boost the skin's
moisture content.<br>
* Avoid using soap as it can irritate the skin.<br>
* Do not pop blisters or pull off peeling skin.<br>
* Keep out of the sun until skin has completely healed.<br>
* Drink plenty of water, because prolonged sun exposure can also lead to
dehydration.<br>
 * Speak to your pharmacist about products that may help soothe sunburn, 
 Most Australians need sun protection when the UV index is three or above.<br>

1. Overexposure to ultraviolet A (UVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB) can cause immediate and long term skin damage, e.g. sunburn, rashes, 
 tissue damage to premature wrinkling and skin cancer.<br>
 Many changes with ageing are the result of damage by too much sun.<br>
 A skin tan occurs when the skin produces additional pigment to protect itself against sunburn from ultraviolet rays.<br>
 Try to minimize your exposure to the sun between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. to wear a hat and tightly woven clothing that covers the body, and use maximum protection sunscreens.<br>
2. Sun-protective clothing fabrics have a tight weave and a dark colour.<br>
 The garment should have a label listing its Ultraviolet Protection Factor (UPF) value.<br>
 The higher the UPF, the more the protection from UV rays, e.g. UPF rating of 20 only allows 1 / 20th of the sun's UV radiation to pass through it.<br>
 For children, apply sunscreens with a minimum SPF of 15 about 30 minutes before they go outdoors.<br>
 Infants should not be in the sun.<br>
 Sunscreens may irritate baby skin and the developing eyes of a baby are vulnerable to sunlight.<br>
3. The best sunscreens block both UVB (UV radiation with wavelength between 315 and 280 nm), which can cause sunburn, and 
UVA, (UV radiation with wavelength between 380 to 315 nm), which damages the skin without causing sunburn.<br>
 The peak sensitivity of the skin is the 290 to 320 nm range that causes sunburn and skin cancer.<br>
 Sunscreen inhibits the production of Vitamin D so 15 minutes per day of direct exposure to the sun is needed.<br>
 Too much sunbathing is one of the major causes of skin cancer across the world.<br>
 An immediate, but short lasting sun tan occurs when the hormone Œ±-melanocyte stimulating hormone is made when the body is exposed to sunlight.<br>
 It is responsible for the development of the pigment melanin when pale unoxidized melanin granules near the skin surface are changed by ultraviolet light to the dark brown oxidized form.<br>
 A lasting sun tan occurs when the amino acid tyrosine produces extra melanin.<br>
4. The higher the sun protection factor, SPF, the more protection a sunscreen offers against UVB, the ultraviolet radiation that causes sunburn.<br>
A sunscreen with SPF 10 blocks 90.0% of UVB, SPF 20 blocks 95.0% of UVB, SPF 30 blocks 96.7% of UVB and SPF 60 blocks 98.3% of UVB.<br>
The SPF indicates how long you can stay in the sun without the skin reddening about 6 hours after exposure.<br>
The exposure needed to produce reddening is called the minimum erythemal dose, MED.<br>
SPF = exposed time for MED in protected skin / exposed time for MED for unprotected skin.<br>
So if you burn in 10 minutes without sunscreen and you apply an SPF 15 sunscreen, be protected from sunburn for 10 √ó 15 = 150 minutes.<br>
However, protection depends on the skin type of the user, amount applied, frequency of reapplication, activities, e.g. swimming, time of day, season, and the percentage of UV reflected to scattered by the environment, e.g. snow to sand.<br>
Swimming and perspiration may reduce the SPF value.<br>
No sunscreen product screens out all UVA rays.<br>
Sunscreens with the same SPF numbers may have different ingredients to different combinations of the same ingredients.<br>
5. Test a new sunscreen first to avoid any allergic reaction.<br>
 Apply 30 minutes before you go outside and reapply after swimming to activity that causes perspiration.<br>
 However, invisible damage and skin ageing can be caused by ultraviolet type A, which does not cause reddening pain.<br>
 Normal sunscreen does not block UVA as effectively as UVB.<br>
 UVA may cause DNA damage to cells deep within the skin and increasing the risk of malignant melanomas.<br>
 So some people recommend purchasing a "broad-spectrum" sunscreen that blocks both UVA and UVB.<br>
 Claims of "all day protection" should be ignored an SPF over 30 does not provide significantly better protection.<br>
 Sunscreens should be reapplied every 80 minutes to remain effective.<br>
6. Most sunscreens containing either an organic chemical compound that absorbs ultraviolet light, e.g. oxybenzone, or an opaque material that reflects light, e.g. zinc oxide.<br>
 The principal ingredients are usually aromatic molecules conjugated with carbonyl groups that absorbs high energy ultraviolet rays.<br>
 Most ingredients do not undergo significant chemical change, so they retain the UV-absorbing potency without significant photodegradation.<br>
 Allowable active ingredients in sun blocks include: p-Aminobenzoic acid (PABA) Avobenzone, Cinoxate, Dioxybenzone, Homosalate, Menthyl anthranilate, Octocrylene, Octyl methoxycinnamate, Octinoxate, Octyl salicylate, Oxybenzone, Padimate O, Phenylbenzimidazole sulfonic acid, Sulisobenzone, Titanium dioxide, Trolamine salicylate, Zinc oxide, Tinosorb (applied to clothing) Mexoryl (not USA).<br>
7. Windows filter out more UVB, that causes sunburn, than UVA that cause premature skin ageing and skin cancer.<br>
However, long term exposure through glass can cause damage.<br>
For example, motor vehicle drivers get more skin cancers on the face and upper body on the side nearest the driver door.<br>
8. A so-called "base tan" from limited exposure to natural light or radiation in a tanning salon can reduce the appearance of sunburn.<br>
 However, it does not protect against sunburn and may lead to the belief that less or even no sunscreen is needed to protect from UVA and UVB.<br>

 Food colouring uses chemicals to add colour to processed foods, drinks, and condiments to add colour to colourless foods, avoid colour loss and provide colour consistency in food.<br>
 Foods with colouring must be are accurately labelled so consumers know what they are eating.<br>
 Food colouring dyes are water-soluble powders, granules, or liquids.<br>
 Food colouring lakes are not water-soluble and are used in fats and oils.<br>
 Synthetic colour additives include FD&amp;C Blue Nos. 1 and 2 and FD&amp;C Green No. 3.<br>
 Food colourings from pigments of vegetables, minerals, or animals include beta carotene, grape skin extract, caramel colour, and saffron.<br>
 Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, may begin in childhood and cause behaviour problems.<br>
 However, there is no conclusive evidence that food colouring causes ADHD.<br>
 However, one study showed that foods containing dyes could increase hyperactive behaviour in 3-, 8- and 9-year-old children given drink mixtures containing Sunset yellow (E110), Carmoisine (E122), Tartrazine (E102), Ponceau 4R (E124), Quinoline yellow (E104), and Allura red (E129), with the preservative sodium benzoate.<br>
 Experiments<br>
Food colourings are used to tint flowers.<br>
Mix food colouring in warm water and place the flower stems in the solution overnight.<br>
The stems will absorb the colours by morning, revealing intriguing designs in different colours.<br>
