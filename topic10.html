<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.15.0H">10.15.0 </a> Different methods of  separation<br>
 1. A mixture solution of calcium chloride and sodium chloride solutions can be separated by adding a solution of sodium carbonate just enough to precipitate calcium as insoluble calcium carbonate.<br>
Both Cacl2 and Na2CO3 are soluble in water and dissociated completely to ions.<br>
The calcium will precipitate in a white precipitate as CaCO3, because :<br>
CaCl2 (aq) + Na2CO3 (aq) --> 2 NaCl (aq) + CaCO3 (s)<br>
and NaCl is highly soluble in water.<br>
 This is a chemical separation technique.<br>
 2. Sulfide ores are roasted to oxides and then reduced to the metals.<br>
 For example, in the metallurgy of iron, iron ore is roasted in a blast furnace, and then reduced to metallic iron by carbon.<br>
 3. Noble metals like gold and silver are converted into their soluble cyanide complexes, which are later recovered after separation from insoluble impurities.<br>
 4. Organic compounds are separated by converting them in to their derivatives by adding reagents and recovered after removal of impurities.<br>
 5. Activated carbon removing colours and odours from organic compounds, e.g. butter absorbing the perfume of roses.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.1.1H"></a>10.1.1 Separate mud and water from muddy water<br>
 Mix mud and water in a test-tube half full of water by shaking.<br>
 Put the test-tube in the test-tube rack.<br>
 This mixture of mud and water is a suspension, because the particles of mud are floating or suspended in the water, but not dissolved in it.<br>
 Place a filter funnel in another test-tube and insert a filter paper in the filter funnel.<br>
 Pour clean water into the filter paper to make it stick to the funnel.<br>
 Shake the suspension and pour it down a glass rod into the filter funnel.<br>
 The liquid that passes through the filter paper and collects in the test-tube is the filtrate.<br>
 Note whether the liquid is still muddy.<br>
 Describe what is left on the filter paper.<br>
 The filtrate should be clear water.<br>
 Mud is left on the filter paper, because the mud particles are too large to pass through the filter paper.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.1.2H"></a>10.1.2 Efficiency of separation of a mixture<br>
Use one of two mixtures:<br>
1. sand, pebbles, salt and oil,<br>
2. sand, iron filings, wood shavings and salt.<br>
Determine the mass off each of the components before mixing them.<br>
When the components are separated again, find the efficiency of the separation process from the recovery percentage for each component.<br>
Analyse potential sources of any differences seen:<br>
1. not washing the filtrate with distilled water, thus leaving a residue behind, or<br>
2. adherence of one material to another.<br>
Repeat the experiment, by improving the efficiency of their separation, and then comparing the recovery percentage of the first trial vs the second trial.<br>
Evaluate the efficacy of different separation techniques, and discus different types of error.<br>
Think about the impact of equipment error on laboratory investigations.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.14.4H"></a>10.14.4 Prepare copper (II) carbonate<br>

 Add the two liquids by pouring one into the other.<br>
 A blue-green solid substance forms, copper carbonate.<br>
 Filter the mixture from the previous experiment that contains the blue-green
solid.<br>
 Copper carbonate remains on the filter paper.<br>
 Pour half a test-tube of hot water onto the copper carbonate to wash away
other substances.<br>

 Filter a quarter of a test-tube of milk.<br>
 Describe what you see.<br>
 All the milk passes through a filter paper.<br>
 Milk is a suspension of substances in water, but the particles are very
small and can pass through filter paper.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.1.4H"></a>10.1.4 Separate chalk from
 coloured blackboard chalk suspension by filtration.<br>
 Grind a finger width of coloured blackboard chalk with a mortar and pestle
and mix it with a quarter of a test-tube of water.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.1.5H"></a>10.1.5 Separate salt from 
 salt water by evaporation.<br>
Put a finger width of sodium chloride in a half a test-tube of hot water
and shake the test-tube to dissolve the salt.<br>
 When any undissolved salt has settled, pour the solution into an evaporating
basin on a tripod stand.<br>
 Put on safety glasses then heat the evaporating basin until the solution
boils.<br>
 Keep the solution boiling until all the water evaporates as steam and
a white residue of salt remains.<br>
 However, if the salt begins to spurt out of the evaporating basin, heat
very slowly.<br>
 Do not taste the salt.<br>
 Place the evaporating basin in the sun or in front of a radiator to dry
the contents completely.<br>
 Store and label the dry chalk.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.1.6H"></a>10.1.6 Separate ammonium
 chloride from ammonium chloride solution.<br>

 Shake the test-tube to make the salt dissolve.<br>
 Filter the mixture and collect the salt water filtrate in an evaporating 
 basin.<br>
 Wear eye protection then heat the salt solution with a Bunsen burner.<br>
 When the salt solution starts to "spit", i.e. sends out small explosions 
 of damp salt, turn off the Bunsen burner and leave the damp salt 
 in the sun to dry.<br>
 Remove the filter paper from the filter funnel and open it.<br>
 Wash the sand on the filter paper with hot demineralized water.<br>
 Lay the filter paper on a flat surface and leave to dry.<br>
 Store and label the dry sand and salt.<br>
 2. Prepare a mixture of salt and sand.<br>
 Put 2 mL of the mixture in a test-tube.<br>
 Add 5 mL of water and shake until all the salt has dissolved.<br>
 Pour the contents of the tube into a filter paper in a funnel over an
evaporating basin.<br>
 Wash the test-tube with water and add this to the filter paper.<br>
 The sand will remain on the filter paper and may be dried and collected.<br>
 Recover the salt from the filtrate by warming the evaporation basin to
drive off the water.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.1.8H"></a>10.1.8 Separate sand and

 Filter the mixture and collect the copper sulfate filtrate in a test-tube.<br>
 Heat the test-tube, but do not completely evaporate the solution.<br>
 When half of it has boiled away and the remaining liquid is a deeper 
blue colour, pour it into an evaporating basin and leave on the 
 bench until blue crystals of copper sulfate form.<br>
 Place the evaporating basin in the sun or in front of a radiator to dry
the contents completely.<br>
 Store and label the dry copper sulfate crystals.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.1.9H"></a>10.1.9 Separate water from 
 copper sulfate solution by distillation.<br>
<a href="10.01.9ch.GIF">See diagram 10.01.9</a>: Distillation.<br>
 Insert one end of a bent glass tube through a one-hole stopper.<br>
 Be careful! Attach rubber tubing to the other end of the bent glass tube.<br>
 Wet the bent glass tube before sliding on the rubber tubing.<br>
 Attach the one-hole stopper to a test-tube a quarter filled with copper
sulfate solution.<br>
 Heat the solution, using a test-tube holder.<br>
 Keep the test-tube moving about over the flame so that the liquid does
not suddenly boil and shoot up into the test-tube.<br>
 Do not look down the test-tube to see what is happening! Heat until the
liquid is slightly boiling and let it simmer for five minutes.<br>
 Do not boil the solution dry.<br>
 Collect a small quantity of water in a second test tube by the condensation 
 of the steam.<br>
 Do not taste the water collected.<br>
 The top of the flame should then be a few centimetres below the bottom
of the test-tube, which can be raised and lowered.<br>
 repeat the experiment using ink instead of copper sulfate solution.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.1.10H"></a>10.1.10 Separate alum from
 alum solution by crystallization.<br>
 Common alum is aluminium potassium sulfate.<br>
 Add a finger width of alum to a quarter of a test-tube of hot water.<br>
 Shake the test-tube to dissolve the alum.<br>
 Keep shaking until no more alum will dissolve and some alum remains on
the bottom of the test-tube.<br>
 Pour a finger width of this hot saturated solution into the evaporating
 basin and leave to cool for a few hours.<br>
 Note the shape of the alum crystals.<br>
 They form diamond-shaped double pyramids.<br>
 Store and label the dry alum crystals.<br>
 Repeat the experiment using magnesium sulfate instead of alum.<br>
 Store and label the dry magnesium sulfate crystals.<br>
 Repeat the experiment using sodium carbonate instead of alum.<br>
 Store and label the dry sodium carbonate crystals, washing soda.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.1.11H"></a>10.1.11 Separate copper

 Put the solid chemicals on a folded piece of clean paper and mix them
with a spatula.<br>
 Pour the mixture into a test-tube.<br>
 Add hot water and stir the mixture to dissolve the magnesium sulfate.<br>
 Filter the mixture to form a residue of copper carbonate on the filter
paper.<br>
 Wash the residue on the filter paper and leave to dry.<br>
 Evaporate the filtrate of magnesium sulfate solution to form magnesium 
sulfate crystals.<br>
 Store and label the dry magnesium sulfate crystals.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.1.12H"></a>10.1.12 Separate methyl
 orange and litmus mixture by chromatography.<br>
 Mix methyl orange powder and twice as much litmus powder.<br>
 Put the powders on a folded piece of clean paper and mix them with a
spatula.<br>
 Put the mixture into a test-tube, add water to the half way mark, and
shake well to dissolve the powders.<br>
 Allow any excess powder to settle then pour off part of the liquid into
another test-tube.<br>
 Place a filter paper on an evaporating basin.<br>
 Use an eye dropper to let drops of the liquid fall one drop at a time
on the centre of the filter paper.<br>
 After a drop has spread, add another drop.<br>
 Repeat the process for four drops.<br>
 Let the liquid spread outwards.<br>
 Note whether the two substances separate.<br>
 The litmus moves through the filter paper more quickly than the methyl
orange, so it forms a blue ring outside the central orange area.<br>
 The substances separate into blue and orange areas on the filter paper.<br>
 Repeat the experiment with a mixture of four drops of green food dye and
six drops of pink food dye, e.g. cochineal, in half a test-tube 
 of water.<br>
 Mix the dyes by shaking the test-tube.<br>
 Use an eye dropper to let drops of the liquid fall one drop at a time
on the centre of the filter paper.<br>
 Let the liquid spread outwards.<br>
 Note whether the two substances separate.<br>
 The colours separate into a green area surrounded by a pink ring.<br>
 Repeat the experiment with only blue-black ink.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.2.01H"></a>10.2.01 Separate by chromatography.<br>
 Chromatography, "colour writing", is used for chemical analysis and separation.<br>
 Chromatography uses the property that some chemicals have preferential
 adsorption on the surface of other materials, so chemicals 
 absorbed at different rates can be separated.<br>
 Different substances or different components move at different speeds 
through a strip of wet paper, a gel, or a gas.<br>
 To separate colourless substances, spray a locating agent on the paper
to colour the separated spots.<br>
 During chromatography, a mixture of different solutes, the moving phase, 
pass over an absorbing medium, the stationary phase.<br>
 Different solutes tend to stay longer or shorter in the moving phase.<br>
 In paper chromatography, the paper and solvent adsorbed to the paper 
is the stationary phase.<br>
 In thin layer chromatography, the stationary phase is a layer on a plastic
or glass plate.<br>
 In column chromatography, the stationary phase substance is packed in
a tube.<br>
Experiments<br>
 1. Separate by column chromatography.<br>
 Use a piece of white chalk as a column.<br>
 Draw a line around the chalk 2 cm from the larger end with mixed ink made
up of red and blue ink in equal quantity.<br>
 Turn this end upside down and let the chalk stand in a Petri dish containing
water with the ink line being above the water level.<br>
 The water acts as a developing agent.<br>
 The water is drawn up the column and raises the mixed ink.<br>
 The red component of the mixed ink moves up faster than the blue component.<br>
 The component colours of the mixed ink are separated to produce two different
coloured bands with red above and blue below.<br>
 2. Use a test-tube with a small hole in the bottom blocked by a plug of
cotton wool.<br>
 Fill the test-tube with powdered chalk packed down lightly with a pencil.<br>
 Pour drops of an equal mixture of ink and water on top of the chalk column.<br>
 The ink mixture moves down the column producing different coloured bands.<br>
 This set of coloured bands is a chromatogram.<br>
 Each band represents a component of the ink.<br>

in coloured sweets, e.g. jelly beans, "Smarties"<br>
 1. Use this method for sweets where the colour is dispersed through the
sweet, e.g. jelly beans.<br>
 This method uses white thread to separate the extracted dye from the extracted
sugar.<br>
 This method extracts only acid dyes.<br>
 Prepare white woollen thread: Use 1 metre of prepared wool for each colour
of the jelly beans.<br>
 Boil one metre of white woollen thread for 10 minutes in 2% ammonia solution, 
rinse under the tap to remove fluorescing dyes, then 
 dry.<br>
 Add 25 mL of warm water to 5 jelly beans of each colour in 5 different 
containers and leave to stand until they look white.<br>
 The solutions now contain dye and sugar, which can be separated by dyeing
the wool.<br>
 For each colour, put a 1 metre piece of prepared white woollen thread 
in a 100 mL beaker and add the dye extract.<br>
 Add 3 drops of 0.1 M acetic acid.<br>
 Heat until boiling and simmer for 5 minutes.<br>
 Remove the dyed wool and wash gently under the tap until no stickiness 
remains.<br>
 Re-extract the dye from the wool by placing it in a beaker containing 
20 mL of 2% ammonia solution and simmer for 5 minutes.<br>
 Remove the wool from the beaker.<br>
 Evaporate the extract in the beaker to dryness on a hot plate in a fume
cupboard.<br>
 Ammonia will be given off.<br>
 Dissolve the dry residue, with constant stirring, in the minimum number
of drops of water to maintain high concentration.<br>
 Use a capillary tube spotter to make &lt; 2 cm spots of solutions of each
colour.<br>
 Use the following solvent mixture: butanol: ethanol: 2% ammonia, in a
3: 1: 1 ratio.<br>
 2. Use this method for sweets where the colour is only on the outside 
layer of the sweet, e.g. "Smarties".<br>
 Wet the surface of the sweet then rub it directly on chromatography paper.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.2.2.8H"></a>10.2.2.8 Chromatography of chlorophyll pigments<br>
 Chloroplasts derive their colour from several pigments (carotenes, xanthophylls
and chlorophylls), which are present in differing 
 amounts, the proportions varying with species.<br>
 You can separate them by paper chromatography.<br>
 1. Cut grass into small pieces and place them in a mortar.<br>
 Add sand, 40 mL methanol and 5 mL petroleum benzene and grind the mixture
vigorously for two minutes with the pestle.<br>
 Pour a few mL of the bright green solution of crude chlorophyll obtained
into a test-tube.<br>
 Add 1 mL of deionized water and shake well.<br>
 Leave the test-tube to stand.<br>
 Most of the pigment passes into the petroleum benzene layer that settles
on top of the diluted methanol.<br>
2. Heat the centre area of a hollow glass tube in
a Bunsen burner flame while rotating the tube slowly.<br>
 When the central area is sufficiently soft, move your hands away from
each other to draw out the hot glass in the middle to form a fine 
 capillary tube.<br>
 After cooling, snap the capillary in two at the centre, thus producing 
two small pipettes with very finely drawn tips called Pasteur 
 pipettes.<br>
 Use one pipette to take a sample of the petroleum benzene containing 
the crude chlorophyll layer settled in the upper part of the 
 test-tube.<br>
 Apply the sample in a line 2 mm wide to a strip of chromatographic paper
so that the line is parallel to and 2 cm from the narrow edges 
 of the strip.<br>
 The coloured line should not touch the edges of the chromatographic strip.<br>
 Prepare more applications to ensure that you have put enough pigment 
on the paper.<br>
 Let the solution dry after each application to prevent the coloured line
from spreading too widely.<br>
 Leave to dry.<br>
3. Pour eluting solvent to a height of 2 cm into 
 a measuring cylinder.<br>
 Fix the chromatographic strip between the two halves of the vertically
 cut cork and suspend it inside the cylinder.<br>
 Push the strip far enough down so that you immerse 1 cm of its lower 
end in the eluting solvent, but keep the line of pigment above the 
 solvent level.<br>
 The strip must not touch the inside wall of the cylinder, otherwise, 
the reagent will not rise evenly.<br>
 Seal the measuring cylinder with a stopper so that the atmosphere surrounding
the chromatographic strip is saturated with the vapour 
 of the eluting solvent.<br>
 Watch the solvent rising up the chromatographic strip.<br>
 After 15 minutes, remove the strip from the cylinder, mark the height 
reached by the solvent with a pencil line and allow the strip to dry 
 in air.<br>
 Note the different bands of colour and their pattern of distribution.<br>
 Carotene is orange yellow, xanthophyll is lemon yellow, chlorophyll a
is blue green and chlorophyll b is yellow green.<br>
 Use a pencil to outline and label the different bands of colour.<br>
Chlorophylls decompose on exposure to light, so do this experiment in the shade.<br>

| <a href="1.13a.GIF">See 1.13a</a>: Simple fume hood.<br>
 An azeotropic mixture has a boiling point that does not change when vapour
is removed by evaporation.<br>
 The boiling point may be higher or lower than any of the components of
the mixture, e.g. A toluene / water mixture has b.p. 85.0<sup>o</sup>C, but b.p. toluene is 110.6<sup>o</sup>C and b.p. water is 100.0<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 Steam distillation is used to separate volatile from non-volatile components
and the reduction in boiling point reduces thermal 
 decomposition.<br>
 For the toluene-water system, below 85<sup>o</sup>C the two liquid phases
coexist.<br>
 At 85<sup>o</sup>C the sum of the vapour pressures of water and toluene
= one atmosphere, and boiling starts.<br>
 In a mixture of toluene and water, boiling occurs at 85<sup>o</sup>C 
and both water and toluene are in the vapour that condenses to form two 
 layers.<br>
 The bottom layer of water has 0.06% toluene dissolved in it.<br>
 The top layer of toluene has 0.05% water dissolved in it.<br>
 The relative volumes are 18% water and 82% toluene.<br>
 The excess toluene flows back into the flask and distils back over with
more water.<br>
 At 85<sup>o</sup>C, vapour pressure of water = 57.7 kPa and vapour pressure
of toluene = 50.6 kPa.<br>
 Weight of water = (molar mass water / molar mass toluene) × (vapour pressure
water / vapour pressure toluene) 
 = (18 / 92) × (57.7 / 50.6) = 0.223 = 20%.<br>
 Be careful! Do experiment in a fume cupboard, fume hood, because toluene
vapour is harmful.<br>
 You can substitute less harmful cyclohexane for toluene.<br>
 However, it is less efficient, carrying over only 8.5% water.<br>
 Use the apparatus to find the amount of water and fat in food, e.g. minced
meat for hamburgers 13% fat and 67% water, minced meat 
 for sausages 26% fat and 47% water.<br>
 1. Water content<br>
 Distil 20 g minced meat or chopped cheese with 80 mL of toluene until no
more water distils over at 110.6<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 Weigh the bottom layer of water.<br>
 2. Fat content<br>
 Pour the remaining toluene from the flask into a pre-weighed beaker.<br>
 Add more toluene to the food in the flask and shake the flask vigorously 
 to extract all the fat.<br>
 Add this toluene to the beaker.<br>
 Evaporate all the toluene under a fume cupboard, fume hood using a water
bath and vacuum pump to leave the fat in the beaker that 
 can be weighed.<br>

<a href="3.2.21ch.GIF">See diagram 3.2.21</a>: Fractional distillation.<br>
 You can separate miscible liquids by fractional distillation if each liquid
has a different boiling point.<br>
 The greater the difference in boiling points the easier to separate the
miscible mixtures into pure substances.<br>
 A fractionation column is a long tube attached to the still containing 
intersections.<br>
 Some vapour condenses on the intersections.<br>
 The refluxing mixture of vapours and condensates in the column allows 
separation of different "fractions", i.e. liquids with different 
 boiling points.<br>
 Distilling petroleum or mixtures of petroleum products may be too dangerous
for most school science classes.<br>
 Use crude oil or a substitute for crude oil by used car oil, paraffin, 
thin lubricating oil, diesel oil and petroleum jelly.<br>
 Use a hard glass test-tube, or sidearm test-tube, fixed to a retort stand, 
a delivery tube and the five small ignition tubes.<br>
 Use a 0-360<sup>o</sup>C thermometer.<br>
 Put 4 mL crude oil in the test-tube.<br>
 Add boiling chips to prevent bumping.<br>
 Set up five small ignition tubes to collect the fractions.<br>
 Heat the oil very gently.<br>
 Collect about 10 drops of distillate in the first ignition tube, then
collect 10 drops of distillate successively in the other tubes.<br>
 The boiling point of the remaining oil will become higher as distillation 
 proceeds and more heat will then be required from the Bunsen 
 burner.<br>
 Arrange the fractions in order of increasing distillation temperature: 
1. up to 80<sup>o</sup>C, 2. 80-120<sup>o</sup>C, 3.120-180<sup>o</sup>C, 
 4. 180-220<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 Observe all the different fractions:<br>
 1. The colour should change from colourless to yellow.<br>

<a href="10.6.1ch.GIF">See diagram 10.6.1</a>: Fractionation.<br>
 Use a mixture of methylated spirit and water.<br>
 When you heat the mixture gently, the ethanol, boiling point 78<sup>o</sup>C, 
 will boil first and condense first.<br>
 Use of a fractionation column allows water to condense on it and drip
back.<br>
 When all the alcohol has evaporated, the temperature rises suddenly and
the remaining water will evaporate.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.6.3H"></a>10.6.3 Distil crude oil and
collect the fractions.<br>
 In the petroleum industry, crude oil is heated to about 400<sup>o</sup>C 
 so that the vapours rise through a tall fractionation column where 
 different fractions are drawn off.<br>
 Higher boiling fractions can be converted to lower boiling point fractions
by the action of silica and aluminium catalysts in a process 
 called catalytic cracking, e.g. C10H22 --> 
C5H12 + C5H10<br>
 Lower molecular weight hydrocarbons undergo alkylation (adding 
or substituting an alkyl group) to form larger hydrocarbons with 
 similar boiling point to gasoline, e.g. C2H6 +
C4H8 --> C6H14<br>
 In the alkylation of benzene, Friedel-Crafts reaction, benzene reacts 
with chloromethane to substitute a CH3 group for H and form 
 methyl benzene (toluene).<br>
 The reaction does no stop there.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.8.0H"></a>10.8.0 Separate by froth
flotation of heavy minerals.<br>
 This method is often used in mineral mining to separate crushed ores from
other rock materials.<br>
 1. Mix crushed ores or a mixture of sand and powdered metal with water.<br>
 Add an oil such as kerosene.<br>
 Blow air through the mixture to form froth.<br>
 The metal-containing mineral particles or powdered metal particles become
covered with the oil, because of attraction of the oil for them.<br>
 The particles stick to the air bubbles that floating on the surface along
with the rising froth.<br>
 The water wets the gangue particles or sand particles and they sink to
the bottom, separating the mineral or metal from the mixture.<br>
 2. Mix crushed lead sulfide (galena) or fine iron filings or zinc dust
or red lead oxide with dry garden soil in a measuring cylinder.<br>
 Add water and kerosene (paraffin oil).<br>
 Close the end of the measuring cylinder with the hand shake vigorously
 for two minutes then leave it to stand.<br>
 The fine metal particles have been separated from the soil by the froth
of kerosene.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.8.1H"></a>10.8.1 Separate sand and lead
powder mixture by panning.<br>
 This method is used to "pan" for gold.<br>
 Gold miners use "panning" to separate the more dense alluvial gold from
the less dense "washings".<br>
 They use a rusty metal dish so that the gold shows up against the colour
of rust.<br>
 Note this type of separation on sea beaches.<br>
 Incoming waves carry a mixture of materials up on to the beach.<br>
 The slower back flow carries back the lighter materials, but leaves the
heavier materials.<br>
 This process can naturally concentrate minerals to form "mineral sands"
with high concentrations of minerals with high molecular weights.<br>
 Put a mixture of sand and lead powder in a shallow tin pan with water.<br>
 Separate the sand from the lead by swirling the material in circles while
holding the pan at an angle to the horizontal.<br>
 Strand the lead powder in the higher part of the pan.<br>

See: <a href="Commercial.html#Crystals">Crystals</a>, (Commercial).<br>
 Crystallization involves the formation of a pure solid from its solution.<br>
 Make a saturated solution of the material in a hot solvent and let the
hot solution cool.<br>
 When the impurity is present in large amounts, the liquid becomes saturated
with both materials and does not separate 
 them.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.9.1H"></a>10.9.1 Separate a mixture 
 of sodium chloride and sodium nitrate.<br>
 Dissolve sodium chloride in 20 mL of water at 70<sup>o</sup>C until the
solution is saturated.<br>
 Add sodium nitrate until no more dissolves.<br>
 Boil the solution filter and cool.<br>
 Sodium nitrate is much more soluble than sodium chloride in hot water, 
so, on cooling, more sodium nitrate than sodium chloride 
 crystallizes out as the solution cools.<br>
 The crystals can dissolve again and cool again.<br>
 Each time this is done the sodium nitrate becomes more pure.<br>

 Calcium hydroxide precipitates as a milky precipitate when breathing 
into limewater.<br>
 To precipitate is to cause a substance to be deposited in solid from a

 Decant, pour off liquid and not disturb underlying sediment.<br>
 Decanting separates the precipitate by inclining the test-tube or other
container so that the level of the liquid rises above the level of the 
 lip of the container so that it can be poured off the precipitate.<br>
 Formerly, wine was always decanted before drinking into a special container
called a decanter to separate organic particles formed 
 during the maturation of the wine, e.g. tartaric acid and tannic aggregations.<br>
 Another reason for decanting wine was to expose wine to the air to release
favourable odours.<br>
 Shaking the wine to allow more access to air may result in unfavourable
 oxidation products.<br>
 Nowadays there is less need or no need to decant wine before drinking 
it, because of the use of the Stelvin capsule and modern 
 methods of filtration.<br>

 The treated water begins to clarify as the colloid particles begin to
clump together, flocculate, and settle to the bottom.<br>
 Another flocculating agent used to clarify muddy water is SIROFLOC.<br>
 Muddy water contains soil held as a colloid.<br>
 During flocculation, charged ions gather around particles with opposite
 charge.<br>
 When colloids suspended in a solvent are no longer suspended in a solvent, 
they fall down to form a loose woolly mass, a flocculent.<br>
 Flocculation is important in water treatment and swimming pool management 
 to separate out visible sediments, and other materials and 
 to treat colloids to remove them.<br>
