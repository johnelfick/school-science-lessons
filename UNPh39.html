* Use a LED, a battery and a resistor.<br>
The passage of current causes the emission of light.<br>
The intensity of light depends on the size of the current.<br>
The direction in which current will flow is the same as that of the arrowhead in the symbol.<br>
* Reverse the connections so that the diode is the other way round.<br>
A LED will allow current to pass in only one direction.<br>
* Connection directly across the battery destroys the LED, so insert a series resistor to limit the current, e.g. 10 milliamperes, mA.<br>

Draw a circuit before connecting the parts.<br>
If their circuit does not behave as expected, try to explain why this happens, before making any changes to the circuit.<br>
CMOS integrated circuits operate over the wide voltage range of 3 V to 18 V and require little supply current, unless driving external devices, 
e.g. LEDs and 7-segment displays.<br>
Use dry cells that can drive the LEDs and the 7-segment displays, because the current required will rarely exceed 0.2 A.<br>
However, the working of CMOS integrated circuits can vary with the supply voltage chosen.<br>
A supply voltage of 5 V or 6 V is recommended.<br>
Integrated circuits can be damaged if supply polarity is reversed, so connect a diode, e.g. IN5401, between the power rails of each circuit, so the 
diode conducts if the supply connections are crossed.<br>
The reverse voltage is about 1 V and current about 3 A.<br>
When connecting prepared circuits, link the corresponding power rails of the circuits before connecting the circuits to the supply.<br>

<a href="39.1.1d.GIF">See diagram 39.1.2</a>: Brightness and current.<br>
Connect the circuit shown, using a LED module, a resistor and a battery.<br>
Use a low value resistor and note how brightly the LED glows.<br>
Replace the resistor first by the one of medium value, then by one of large value, e.g. 27 k ohms, 2.7 k ohms and 270 ohms.<br>
Note what happens to the brightness of the LED and how does the brightness of the LED depend on the current passing through it.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="39.1.3H">39.1.3</a> LEDs in parallel<br>
<a href="39.1.1d.GIF">See diagram 39.1.3</a>: LEDs in parallel.<br>
Use one red LED, one green LED and a battery.<br>
Both LEDs glow, because Two LEDs of the same colour and resistance connected in parallel will glow with the same brightness.<br>
The currents through each LED are equal.<br>
A LED of different colour with the same value of series resistor may not glow with the same brightness.<br>
Use a milliammeter to show that the currents through red and green LEDs with equal series resistors are almost the same.<br>
Variations in apparent brightness are due to differences in the materials and to variations in the sensitivity of the eye to different colours.<br>

<a href="39.1.1d.GIF">See diagram 39.1.5</a>: Light-dependent resistor (LDR).<br>
Use a light dependent resistor in series with a LED and a battery.<br>
If the LED is covered or uncovered, the current will flow in either direction as with an ordinary resistor.<br>
The resistance of a LDR is very large in the dark, e.g. a million ohms or more, but falls to a small value, e.g. two hundred ohms, in bright light.<br>
Cadmium sulfide is commonly used for LDRs.<br>
A LDR is not a photocell.<br>

The buzzer probably has a definite polarity.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">39.2.0 Switches<br>
The next 3 experiments show the progression from direct manual control to magnetic control, and then to electromagnetic control.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="39.2.1H">39.2.1</a> Manual control of a LED<br>
<a href="39.2.1d.GIF">See diagram 39.2.1</a>: Manual control of a LED.<br>
Connect a battery, and LED and a push-button switch together in a series circuit.<br>
The LED lights only when the push-button switch is pressed.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="39.2.2H">39.2.2</a> Reed switch and magnet<br>
<a href="39.2.1d.GIF">See diagram 39.2.2</a>: Reed switch and magnet.<br>
Use a magnifying glass to see the two metal contacts inside the glass envelope of the reed switch.<br>
These contacts are normally open.<br>
Connect the switch in series with a buzzer and a battery.<br>
Bring a small bar magnet close to the reed switch to see the contacts close.<br>
A reed switch has two metal contacts, "reeds", inside a glass envelope filled with an inert gas to prevent corrosion.<br>
The contacts consist of a ferrous metal so a magnet can magnetize them.<br>
Bring the magnet close to the switch so that the metal strips become magnetized and attract each other.<br>
When the contacts close, a current flows through the buzzer.<br>
The magnet produces a force that closes the switch contacts.<br>
The reed switch contacts either are open or closed, so the reed switch is a single-pole, single-throw, SPST switch.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="39.2.3H">39.2.3</a> Reed switch and coil, reed relay<br>
<a href="39.2.1d.GIF">See diagram 39.2.3</a>: Reed switch and coil - reed relay.<br>
Using a reed relay with two separate battery supplies.<br>
Do not use either of the diode connections to the coil of the relay.<br>
In this experiment, switching is controlled by the magnetic effect of a current-carrying coil that has a magnetic effect, an electromagnetic relay.<br>
When the switch is closed, the relay uses a changeover reed switch, a single-pole double-throw, SPDT, switch.<br>
The reed C and contact A consist of a magnetic metal.<br>
Contact B is a nonmagnetic metal.<br>
Contact C is normally in contact with B.<br>
However, when a magnetic field magnetizes A and C, they are attracted together so that contact with B is broken and C contacts A instead.<br>
Remove the field and C springs back to its original position.<br>
Change the switch connections at the relay so that the LED is on until the push-button switch is pressed.<br>
If current flows through the coil, the reed switch changes over and the LED lights.<br>
Note that the flow of an electric current now determines the switching, and although the two circuits are separate, what happens in one circuit is 
controlled by what happens in the other circuit.<br>
The current through the coil, needed to operate the switch, is usually smaller than the current allowed through the switch contacts.<br>
So if the LED and resistor were replaced by an electric motor that needed a large current to make it rotate, the electric motor could be operated by 
 a much smaller current through the coil circuit.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="39.2.4H">39.2.4</a> Reed relay used to control a motor<br>
<a href="39.2.1d.GIF">See diagram 39.2.4</a>: Reed relay used to control a motor.<br>
Use a reed switch, a motor and two batteries.<br>
When the LDR is covered, its resistance is great, and not enough current flows through the relay coil to operate the reed switch and switch on the motor.<br>
When the LDR is well illuminated with a torch, its resistance decreases and the relay operates.<br>
Insert ammeters in series with the coil and the motor to show that the current through the motor, e.g. 0.2 A, is more than the current through the coil.<br>
So the flow of a small current is used to control the flow of a much larger current.<br>
If the reed relay is not used, the change in the resistance of the LDR is not enough to allow the motor to operate.<br>

<a href="39.2.1d.GIF">See diagram 39.2.5</a>: Reed relay with coil, contacts in parallel.<br>
In 39.2.4 and 39.2.6, a small current in one circuit controlled a much larger current in another circuit that was completely separate with its own power supply.<br>
In this experiment, a current through one branch of a parallel circuit, the coil branch, controls a much larger current through another branch, the motor 
 branch, using only one battery.<br>
Note what happens to the motor when the switch is closed.<br>
In this circuit, the relay coil and the relay contacts are connected in parallel.<br>
Trace the closed current paths from the battery, through each branch of the circuit and back to the battery again.<br>
This circuit uses the idea of positive and negative supply rails.<br>

<a href="39.2.1d.GIF">See diagram 39.2.6</a>: Automatic washing line.<br>
Use two batteries, reed relay, electric motor and the rain sensor to make a circuit that switches on an electric motor when rain fails.<br>
Make a rain sensor from a small piece of strip board on which are six copper strips are connected.<br>
If a conducting solution bridges any of the strips, the two leads are short circuited allowing current to flow through the relay coil.<br>
If the experiment does not work with tap water add salt to the water.<br>
Rain water may conduct electricity, but not sufficiently to operate the reed relay in the circuit.<br>
The experiment will work with rain if the copper strips are covered by dry absorbent paper soaked in a salt solution.<br>

The truth table for an OR circuit tells us that the LED is on when either S1 OR S2, or both, are pressed.<br>
In a burglar alarm pressure pads are open SPST switches.<br>
A pad is placed under a carpet so that the pressure of the burglar's foot closes the switch.<br>
The circuit could be used with two such switches.<br>
An alarm sounds, if the buzzer replaces the LED, if entry were through door 1 OR door 2.<br>

<a href="39.3.1d.GIF">See diagram 39.3.3</a>: Relay as a NAND circuit.<br>
A logic circuit is a switching circuit in which the state of the output at any instant depends on the present state of all the inputs.<br>
The output is HIGH only for some input combinations.<br>
NAND is a contraction of "negative AND".<br>
NAND circuits are commonly used in electronics.<br>
Construct the NAND relay circuit with its coil and contacts in parallel with the supply, and its inputs and outputs are either HIGH or LOW.<br>

Using a reed relay, a LED and a battery, connect leads to the diode input terminals of the relay, A and B.<br>
Connect the other end of one of these leads to the positive supply rail so that the input is HIGH.<br>
Connect the lead to the negative supply rail so that the input is LOW.<br>
The output is HIGH if the LED is on and LOW if the LED is off.<br>
The output is HIGH when one or both of the inputs are LOW.<br>
In an AND circuit, its output is HIGH when input A and input B are HIGH, see the AND circuit truth table below.<br>
In a NAND circuit, the output is LOW when input A and input B are HIGH, see the NAND relay circuit truth table below.<br>
The contacts at the output form an SPDT switch.<br>
Connect the pole of this switch to the negative supply rail, i.e. the output is LOW.<br>
This is the position at the output when no current flows through the relay coil.<br>
When either or both inputs are taken LOW, current flows through the coil and the output contact changes over.<br>
The output goes HIGH and the LED module is connected directly to the positive supply rail.<br>
No current can flow through an input if it is HIGH nor if the input is unconnected.<br>
So an unconnected input behaves as though it were HIGH.<br>
Include diodes at the inputs, because without diodes, if one input taken HIGH and the other taken LOW, a short circuit across the battery may occur.<br>

Note what happens when switch A or switch B is pressed, or both are pressed together.<br>
Modify this circuit so that the alarm sounds either when a switch was closed or when a light shines on a LDR.<br>
This circuit is more realistic using pressure pads instead of the switch modules, as in 39.3.2.<br>
A light beam can trigger the alarm by replacing one switch module by a LDR module.<br>
Cover the LDR or darken the room so that the LED will have a very HIGH resistance and little current flows through the relay coil.<br>
When light fails on the LDR its resistance rapidly decreases and current can flow through the coil, so the LDR operates the relay.<br>
The input is now LOW.<br>

Use two NAND circuits (one connected as an inverter), two LDR modules and a buzzer.<br>
Illuminate each LDR with a light beam.<br>
If light shines on an LDR, its resistance is LOW.<br>
The inputs of the first NAND circuit are therefore LOW, so its output must be HIGH.<br>
The buzzer sounds only when both the LDRs are shaded.<br>
The second NAND circuit is an inverter, so its output is LOW and the buzzer does not sound.<br>
If one LDR is covered, but not the other, one input is still LOW, a current still flows in the coil, the output of the first NAND circuit is still HIGH, the 
output of the inverter is LOW, and nothing happens.<br>
However, if both LDRs are covered, the output from the first NAND is LOW, so the output from the second is HIGH and the buzzer sounds.<br>
If objects of greater length than the distance between the LDRs pass in front of them, the buzzer sounds.<br>
The two relay modules, a NAND circuit followed by an inverter, are together acting as an AND circuit.<br>
So, the output is HIGH, the buzzer sounds, only when input 1 AND input 2 are HIGH.<br>

<a href="39.3.6d.GIF">See diagram 39.3.8</a>: Two NAND circuits as a bistable ("Flip-flop").<br>
(This circuit may be called a Bistable multibrator.)<br>
To show the circuit, press the RESET switch.<br>
The green LED is on and the red LED is off.<br>
Press the SET switch.<br>
The red LED is on and the green LED is off.<br>
Press the SET switch repeatedly.<br>
The red LED is still on and the green LED is still off.<br>
Press the RESET switch again.<br>
The green LED is on and the red LED is off.<br>
Press the RESET switch repeatedly.<br>
The green LED is still on and the red LED is still off.<br>
When the RESET switch is pressed, the output of NAND circuit 2 is HIGH and the output of NAND circuit 1 is LOW.<br>
When the SET switch is pressed, the output of circuit 1 is HIGH and the output of circuit 2 is LOW.<br>
The bistable circuit has two stable states.<br>
The first stable state occurs when the output of NAND circuit 2 is HIGH and the output of NAND circuit 1 is LOW, the RESET state.<br>
The second stable state occurs when the output of NAND circuit 1 is HIGH and the output of NAND circuit 2 is LOW, the SET state.<br>
In a bistable circuit, after the SET switch has been pressed, repeated depressions of this switch have no effect.<br>
Also, after the RESET switch has been pressed, repeated pressing of this switch have no effect.<br>
The SET and RESET inputs are normally unconnected, i.e. they "float HIGH".<br>
To change from one stable state to the other the appropriate input must be taken LOW.<br>
Follow the path of the current flow through the coils and the connections between the two NAND circuits.<br>
Note how the two NAND circuits are joined and share the same power rails.<br>
The output C of the first circuit is connected to the input D of the second circuit.<br>
Similarly, the output F of the second circuit is connected to the input A of the first circuit.<br>
A red LED is connected between C and M.<br>
If C is HIGH, the red LED will light.<br>
If C is LOW, the red LED will not light.<br>A green LED is connected between F and N.<br>
If F is HIGH, the green LED will light.<br>
If F is LOW, the green LED will not light.<br>
A bistable circuit has two stable states.<br>
For the first stable state, if C is HIGH, the red LED will light, D will be HIGH, F will be LOW so the green LED will not light.<br>
As F is low, A is LOW, so C remains HIGH.<br>
For the second stable state, if C is LOW, the red LED will not light, D will be LOW, F will then be HIGH so the green LED will light.<br>
As F is high, A is HIGH, so C remains LOW.<br>
This is the second stable state, and so it is called a "bistable" - it has two stable states.<br>
Note that the output of the 1st module is connected to the input of the 2nd module and the output of the 2<sup>nd</sup> module is connected to the 
input of the 1<sup>st</sup> module.<br>
1. To set the bistable in one stable state or the other, push-button switches are connected between input B and the negative rail at P and between input 
E and the negative rail at Q.<br>
2. To set the first stable state, press the push-button switch at P, current flows through the relay coil, C becomes HIGH and the red LED will light.<br>
3. To set the second stable state, press the second push button at Q, current flows through the relay coil F becomes HIGH, the green LED will light.<br>
The circuit could be used to control of simple traffic lights so that the red light and the green light cannot be turned on together.<br>

Replace the red LED in the circuit of 39.3.8 with a buzzer.<br>

If the buzzer sounds, press the RESET switch to silence it.<br>
The SET switch is now the trip switch of the alarm.<br>
If it is pressed, the alarm sounds and it cannot be turned off by releasing the trip switch or pressing it again.<br>
The output is said to be "locked" or "latched", because the bistable is locked in its second stable state.<br>
The alarm can only be turned off by pressing the RESET switch.<br>
This latched alarm is an improvement on the alarm constructed in 39.3.4.<br>

<a href="39.4.1d.GIF">See diagram 39.4.1.2</a>: Control function in an AND gate.<br>
The term "gate" refers to the switching circuit in which the state of the output at any instant depends on the state of the inputs at that instant, 
 i.e. a logic circuit.<br>
In an AND gate one of its inputs has a control function when a succession of high and low pulses arriving at the other input.<br>
If the control input is held low, the output will be held low if the state of the other input is high or low, so the gate is closed.<br>
If the control input is held high, the output state follows the state of the other input, so the gate is open.<br>
A NAND gate is open when its control input is high, as with an AND gate, but the pulses arriving at the other input are inverted when they arrive at 
the output.<br>
The OR gate and NOR gates are both open when their control inputs are low.<br>
However, the output pulses are inverted with the NOR gate.<br>

In these experiments integrated circuit NAND gates are used instead of NAND circuit relays.<br>
However, the circuits are identical whether relay or integrated circuit (IC) NAND gates are used.<br>
These applications use illuminated LDRs to keep inputs low.<br>
So an LDR can act as a switch that is open in the dark and closed when illuminated.<br>
Connect input devices such as LDRs between gate inputs and the negative supply rail.<br>
An unconnected input floats high, so an LDR connected to the positive supply rail will not change logic level at the input when illumination changes.<br>
When connected to the negative supply rail, an LDR will cause a low level input when brightly illuminated, low resistance, and a high level input when 
dark, high resistance.<br>
A suitable LDR is the ORP 12.<br>
Buzzers are used, because they are low current devices that can operate over a voltage range of 3 V to 15 V and emit a constant frequency audible tone.<br>

This circuit could be used to turn on a light when it gets dark.<br>
This application uses two NAND gate inverters to drive a LED indicator.<br>
The circuit on the left is not very sensitive to changes of light intensity, because the LDR and the internal circuitry of the NAND gate module form a 
potential divider between the supply rails.<br>
As R has a high resistance, it needs a large change in the resistance of the LDR to change the voltage level at the NAND gate input appreciably.<br>
The second circuit allows the sensitivity to be changed.<br>
The variable resistor should be set so that the LED is on the verge of switching on.<br>

In the circuit diagram, the LED indicator connected to the output of NAND gate 1 is not drawn beneath the LED indicator of gate 2.<br>

Circuit diagrams are easier to understand if the parts are drawn in convenient places rather than as they are placed on the modules.<br>
The positive power rail is drawn in the above diagram although no leads are shown connected to it.<br>
Such a power rail may be omitted from circuit diagrams, but are included in these experiments.<br>
In this experiment when the RESET switch is pressed, the output of NAND gate 2 goes high and the output of NAND gate 1 is low.<br>
When the SET switch is pressed, the output of NAND gate 1 goes high and the output of NAND gate 2 goes low.<br>
The bistable circuit has two stable states.<br>
The first stable state exists when the output of 2 is high and the output of 1 is low (the RESET state).<br>
The second stable state exists when the output of 1 is high and the output of 2 is low (the SET state).<br>
After the SET switch has been pressed, more depressions of this switch have no effect.<br>
The same is true of the RESET switch.<br>
The SET and RESET inputs are normally high.<br>
To change from one stable state to the other, the appropriate input must be taken briefly low.<br>

1. Use two NAND gates, two push-button switches and a buzzer to make a latched burglar alarm.<br>
One switch should correspond to the "trip" switch.<br>
If this is closed (by the burglar's foot, perhaps) the alarm should sound and stay on even when the switch is released or pressed again.<br>
The second switch should correspond to the "reset" switch, and would be hidden away in a place known only to the householder.<br>
Only when this switch is pressed should the alarm be silenced.<br>
Convert this circuit to an alarm that will come on and stay on when a light, e.g. the burglar's torch, shines on an LDR.<br>
Replace the trip switch by an LDR to make a light-activated latched alarm.<br>
A variable resistor connected between the LDR and the positive supply rail to form a potential divider, will allow the sensitivity to be adjusted.<br>
With CMOS modules, the output of NAND gate 1 may be unable to drive both the buzzer and the input to NAND gate 2.<br>
Use a LED indicator rather than a buzzer.<br>
2. Try to "buffer" the buzzer by connecting it to the output of another NAND gate whose inputs go to the output of NAND 2 in the circuit above.<br>
When the "trip" switch is pressed, the alarm sounds and cannot be turned off by releasing the switch or by depressing it again.<br>
The output is "latched".<br>
The bistable is now locked in its second stable state (the state with the output of the NAND gate connected to the buzzer high, and the output of the 
other NAND gate low.<br>
The alarm can only be turned off by pressing the "reset" switch.<br>

A quiz master circuit is used to identify the first contestant to push the answer button in a quiz game.<br>
Each contestant has a push-button and a LED indicator light.<br>
The light of the first person to answer should come on and stay on.<br>
Simultaneously all other lights should be prevented from coming on.<br>
Use four NAND gates two connected as a bistable, a push-button switch and a LED indicator.<br>
Complete the wiring of the four gates for one contestant, then wire for another contestant separately.<br>
Finally connect the two sets.<br>
If the B inputs of the two quiz stations are taken low, the bistable circuit formed by the two right hand gates will be reset.<br>
So the 5 outputs at the stations are high and the LEDs are off.<br>
At the station of one contestant, the A input will initially be high, because it is connected to the output of the other station that has just been reset.<br>
The A input effectively "opens" the NAND gate to which it is connected, so if this contestant is the first to press the switch, the bistable is set by a 
low pulse and the LED indicator comes on.<br>
At the same time 0 goes low, and since this output is connected to the A input of the other station, the NAND gate controlled by this A input is closed.<br>
This means that a low going pulse from the other contestant's push-button can pass to the bistable.<br>
The bistable therefore remains in the reset state with the indicator light off.<br>
Build a simpler quiz master station using fewer NAND gates, but it may not have the required properties of simultaneously latching the victor's indicator

<a href="39.6.1d.GIF">See diagram 39.6.2.1</a>: Simplest driver amplifier with a transistor and a resistor.<br>
The function of a driver is to provide an interface between a device such as an integrated circuit that can control only a small current, and a device 
such as a relay or an electric motor, which usually requires a large current for its operation.<br>
The simplest and cheapest inverting driver amplifier consists of a single transistor and one resistor.<br>
A relay and its protective diode, essential when switching inductive loads, would then be connected between the positive supply line and the transistor 
collector in the way shown.<br>
When the transistor input goes high, the collector current flows through the relay coil into the transistor.<br>
Use two transistors connected as a Darlington pair.<br>
The current gain of such a system is far higher than that of a single transistor, and the base current needed to switch the collector current on is then easily 
supplied by the high output of any integrated circuit.<br>
Note that the circuit diagram shows the motor being driven by a separate power supply.<br>

The point about this application is that, when illuminated, the resistance of the LDRs will be low.<br>

Let a high input represent the binary digit 1, and let a low input represent binary digit 0.<br>
Use the flying leads to complete the tables.<br>
When the digit 1 is displayed, segments b and c of the display are In.<br>
Which outputs of the decoder must then be low, and which outputs are high?<br>
As there are four inputs (A, B, C and D) to the decoder, 2<sup>4</sup> or 16 separate messages can be transferred.<br>
When the binary number 0000 is received, the decoder gives the message that a, b, c, d, e, f should light and the number 0 is displayed.<br>
When the input 0001 is received the message goes out that b and c should light and hence the number 1 displayed.<br>
With a common cathode module, the inputs b and c are high, and all the others low.<br>
The integrated circuit used in this experiment is called a BCD to seven segment decoder/driver.<br>
 (BCD stands for "Binary Coded Decimal").<br>
The input is a decimal digit in the binary code (i.e. 0000 to 1001) and the decoder decodes the input to drive a seven segment display.<br>
A BCD to seven segment display decoder may or may not respond to the numbers beyond 1001 (i.e. from 1010 to 1111), depending on the 
 integrated circuit used.<br>
For the recommended CMOS decoder/driver, the display will be blank beyond 1001.<br>
An N bit binary code is said to be completely decoded if 2<sup>N</sup> distinct output signals are produced from N input signals.<br>
In each case every possible binary pattern present on the input lines activates a distinct output line.<br>
With two inputs there are four possible binary patterns (00, 01, 10 and 11) and so four output lines are required.<br>
With three inputs, eight output lines are required.<br>
With four inputs 16 output lines are required.<br>
So N inputs require 2<sup>N</sup> outputs for complete decoding.<br>
In computers with 16 lines from the microprocessor to the computer memory, each memory location is identified by a different binary pattern 
 on these lines.<br>
A separate and unique signal must be generated for each location when it is selected for the storage or retrieval of information.<br>
If the 16 memory input lines are completely decoded, 2<sup>16</sup> = 65, 536 distinct signals can be generated to select memory locations.<br>
Some microcomputers have a memory size of 64 K where 1 K = 1024.<br>
So 64 K means that there are 64 × 1024 = 65, 536 memory locations.<br>
The BCD to seven segment display decoder used earlier is not a complete decoder, since R has 4 inputs, but only 7, not 16, outputs, so it is a partial decoder.<br>

Use the results from above to draw a circuit diagram of a 2 line to 4 line decoder.<br>
Build the decoder with NAND gates.<br>
NAND gates with 3 inputs are also available in integrated circuit form (the output is low only when all 3 inputs are high).<br>
Draw a circuit diagram showing how a 3 line to 8 line decoder could be built from 2 input and 3 input NAND gates.<br>
A 3 line to 8 line decoder can be built using 2 input NAND gates only.<br>
How many of these gates would be required?<br>
Gate 4 provides the high output to light the LED and is not essential to the decoding function.<br>
Integrated circuit decoders are often available with high or with low outputs and the choice between these depends on the task the decoder has to do.<br>
This 2 line to 4 line decoder uses ten NAND gates.<br>
To build the decoder with low outputs only six NAND gates are required.<br>
Use voltmeters to detect the logic levels.<br>
A 3 line to 8 line decoder would require three NAND gates to invert the three inputs X1, Y1 and Z1 to produce X2, Y2 and Z2.<br>
Eight 3-input NAND gates would then be required to produce a distinct low output for each of the eight possible combinations of X, Y and Z at the 
 decoder inputs.<br>
If high outputs are preferred to light indicators, a further eight NAND gates connected as inverters would be needed.<br>
Since three 2-input NAND gates are required to produce one 3-input NAND gate, a total of [3 + (8 × 3) + 8] = 35 two input NAND gates would be 
required to produce a 3 line to 8 line decoder with high outputs.<br>
Such decoders are available as single integrated circuits.<br>
