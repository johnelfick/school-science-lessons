 Angle is the measurement of the inclination of one line to another.<br>
 Degrees, <sup> o</sup>: An angle is usually measured in degrees, 360 degrees (360<sup>o</sup>) = 1 revolution.<br>
 Degree is the unit of angle.<br>
 One revolution = 360 degrees, 360<sup>o</sup>.<br>
 One right angle = 90 degrees, 90<sup>o</sup>.<br>
 Degree can be divided into arc minutes, arcmin, such that 1 arcmin, 1' = 1 / 60 of a degree.<br>
 Degree can also be divided into arc seconds, arcsec, such that 1 arcsec, 1" = 1 / 3 600 of a degree.<br>
 Arc minutes and arc seconds are used in astronomy to measure the diameter or separation of astronomical objects.<br>

<a href="#6.2.41H">3.2.41</a> Micron, µ (mu)<br>
One ångström unit, symbol A = 10<sup>-10</sup> metre (one hundred-millionth of a centimetre), previously used as unit of measurement of wavelength, but nowadays use nanometre.<br>
(Note: 1 nm = nanometre = 10 Angstrom units = 10<sup>-9</sup> m.).<br>
The unit, named after A. J. Ångström, Sweden (1814-1874), is still used in crystallography and to measure wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="6.2.5H">6.2.5</a> Aspect ratio<br>
Aspect ratio is the proportion between width and height, W: H format, e.g. for HD television channels the aspect ratio =16: 9, 1.77: 1.<br>
Check the aspect ratio on your television set.<br>
Each paper size in the A series of International Standard (I.S.O.), paper sizes is half the area of the next biggest sheet, half as wide, 
but same length, so 2 A4 sheets side to side = 1 A3 sheet.<br>
If length = L and width = W, L /W = sqrt 2 = 1.41, the aspect ratio for the A series of paper sizes.<br>
So one sheet of A3 can be reduced to one sheet of A4, with the photocopier control panel set to 71%, approximately 1/sqrt 2.<br>
Similarly, for enlargements, the control panel is set to 141%.<br>
This aspect ratio allows exact reductions or enlargement, but in USA and Canada, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), uses two different aspect ratios in photocopiers.<br>

One Astronomical unit = the mean distance between the Earth and the Sun, 149 597 871 km, but taken as 1.496 × 10<sup>8</sup>km, (93 million miles).<br>
It is used as a convenient way to measure distance in the solar system.<br>

The imperial unit ounce may be a measure of mass or volume<br>
1 avoirdupois weight pound (lb) = 16 ounces (oz.).<br>
All chemicals were sold by avoirdupois weight.<br>
(Latin: pondus (weight), 12 ounces of pure silver, 240 pennies, so cash to the value of 20 shillings sterling, symbol lb<br>
(Latin: <i>libra pondo</i> (libra, scale, pondo, by weight)<br>
A fluid dram is 1 ⁄ 8 of a fluid ounce, i.e. 3.696 mL USA and 3.551 mL UK.<br>
In Scotland, a dram is a small volume of Scotch whisky.<br>

<a href="UNPh36.1.html#36.10.2H">See 36.10.2</a>: Mass, inertial mass and gravitational mass<br>
The kilogram is the base unit of mass.<br>
Originally, the gram was intended to be the mass of a cubic centimetre of pure water at 4<sup>o</sup>C, but the gram was later defined as one thousandth part of a kilogram.<br>
So the standard of mass is now the kilogram.<br>
A kilogram is the mass of the international prototype kilogram kept in Sevres, France, as a 90% platinum and 10% iridium cylinder at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures.<br>
A proposed alternative definition, called the Planck value is that a kilogram is such that the Planck constant is exactly 
6.6 260 693 × 10<sup>-34</sup> joule seconds.<br>

* The "present"<br>
Archaeologists define "the present" at 1 January 1950, a date before nuclear explosions contamination of the Earth.<br>
So an event said to occur "10, 000 years ago" occurred 10, 000 years before 1 January 1950.<br>
* Seconds<br>
The "second" refers to the second division of time into sixtieths after dividing the hour into minutes.<br>
A second is the time equal to the duration of 9 192 631 770 cycles of oscillation (periods of the radiation) corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the Caesium 133 atom.<br>
Before 1956, the mean solar day was 24 hours, at 60 minutes per hour, and 60 seconds per minute = 84, 400 seconds.<br>
60 seconds = 1 minute<br>
60 minutes = 1 hour<br>
24 hours = 1 day<br>
7 days = 1 week<br>
365 days = 1 year, 366 days = 1 leap year<br>
10 years = 1 decade<br>
100 years = 1 century<br>
1000 years = 1 millennium<br>

* A leap second<br>
ABC / Reuters, Posted Sun Jul 1, 2012 1: 26pm AEST (Australia)<br>
An extra second has been added to the world's atomic clocks in an adjustment to keep them in step with the slowing rotation of the Earth.<br>
The so-called "leap second" was added to electronic clocks at midnight universal time on Saturday.<br>
At that time, atomic clocks read 23 hours, 59 minutes and 60 seconds before they moved on to Greenwich Mean Time.<br>
Super-accurate atomic clocks are the ultimate reference point by which the world sets its wrist watches.<br>
But their precise regularity, which is much more constant than the shifting movement of the Earth around the sun that marks out our days and nights, brings problems of its own.<br>
If no adjustments were made, the clocks would move further ahead and after many years the sun would set at midday.<br>
Leap seconds have a similar function to the extra day in each leap year, which keeps the calendar in sync with the seasons.<br>
The last so-called leap seconds happened in 2008, 2005 and 1998.<br>
Adjustments to atomic clocks are more than a technical curiosity.<br>
A collection of the highly accurate devices are used to set Coordinated Universal Time, which governs time standards on the world wide web, satellite navigation, banking computer networks and international air traffic systems.<br>
There have been calls to abandon leap seconds, but a meeting of the International Telecommunications Union, the UN agency responsible for international communications standards, failed to reach a consensus in January.<br>
Opponents of the leap second want a simpler system that avoids the costs and margin for error in making manual changes to thousands of computer networks.<br>
Supporters argue it needs to stay to preserve the precision of systems in areas like navigation.<br>
A decision is not urgent.<br>
Some estimate that if the current arrangement stays, the world may eventually have to start adding two leap seconds a year.<br>
But that is not expected to happen for another hundred years or so.<br>

Concentration is the quantity of dissolved substance to quantity of solvent.<br>
Dilution is the volume of solvent in which a measured amount of solute is dissolved.<br>
Different ways of expressing concentration, e.g. ppm, % weight for weight (w/w), % weight for volume (w/v).<br>
Parts per million by mass (ppm, milligrams per kilogram, 0.0 001%) = about a grain of sugar in a cup of tea.<br>
Parts per million, (ppm), 1 ppm = 1 mg per litre.<br>
Parts per million, (ppm), usually refers to ppm by weight 1g solute per 1, 000, 000 g solution = 0.001 g per 1, 000 g solution = 1 mg solute per 1 kg solution.<br>
If aqueous solution, where concentration of solute is so low that assume solution density = 1.00 g / mL, then ppm = 1 mg of solute per litre of solution.<br>
So using this assumption, convert ppm in mg / Litre to molarity in mol / Litre.<br>
If x ppm of Ca2+ ions (atomic weight of calcium = 40.8), then x ppm = x mg Ca2+ / Litre of solution = 0.00x g / Litre, 0.00x / 40.08 = mol / Litre.<br>

For precious stones, 1 carat is about 1 / 142 of an ounce, formerly 3.17 grains, now standardised at 0.20 grams.<br>
For gold, a carat is a ratio of 1 / 24.<br>
Purity of gold is measured in carats.<br>
24 carat gold is pure gold.<br>
22 carat gold is 22 parts pure gold and 2 parts copper or other metal alloy.<br>
14 carat gold is 14 parts pure gold and 14 parts copper or other metal.<br>
The official mark stamped on gold and silver objects after being assayed is the hall mark (from Goldsmith's Hall, London).<br>
For gold, the standard mark is a crown in England for 22 and 18 carat gold followed by the number of carats in figures.<br>
Lower standards of gold have the number of carats in figures without the crown.<br>
The term "carat" is said to come from Arabic <i>quirat</i> and Greek <i>keration</i>, the seed of <a href="UNBiolN3C.html#CeratoniaspH">Carob</a> tree <i>Ceratonia siliqua</i>.<br>
It was used to weigh gold, at 0.18 g per seed, regardless of the shape of the seed.<br>
Although this assumption was found to be inaccurate, for a long time the carob seed remained the only known way to weigh gold.<br>

1. Relative positions between measured object and equipment +<br>
When you read on a scale with a measured object directly touching with the equipment, be careful as their relative position will probably affect precision of your readings.<br>
For example, if you measure temperature of liquid by a thermometer, you must immerse completely the measuring bulb in the liquid as you take readings.<br>
2. Reaction time of the equipment<br>
Some equipment reacts to measured quantities very quickly, such as meters for measuring electricity.<br>
However, some equipment needs a certain reacting time, such as a mercury thermometer.<br>
So you must take readings after the equipment stabilizes.<br>
Even with equipment that reacts quickly you need to pay attention to such problems, e.g. when measuring electric potential, be certain that the pointer no longer moves before you read from the scale.<br>
3. Line of vision<br>
The angle between your line of vision and the object referred to can cause errors.<br>
Your eye should be at right angles to the scale and directly opposite the part of the scale you are reading.<br>
Reading a scale from the left side or the right side or above or below are all wrong, because they result in parallax error.<br>
4. Record measurements in tables<br>
Set up a table vertically if there is a possibility of additional requiring some extra space.<br>
Include a title and table number on the top of a table to state what data the table contains.<br>
The first column should contain data for the independent variable rather than the dependent variable.<br>
The weight is the independent variable, because you decide its values, usually before doing the experiment.<br>
The increase in length of spring is the dependent variable, because it depends on the weight added.<br>
Express all data in standard form.<br>
Increase in length of spring.<br>

1. A Möbius strip is a two-dimensional surface with only one side.<br>
It can be constructed in three dimensions as follows.<br>
Take a rectangular strip of paper and join the two ends of the strip together so that it has a 180 degree twist.<br>
It is now possible to start at a point A on the surface and trace out a path that passes through the point which is apparently on the other side of the surface from A.<br>
2. Cut a strip of paper 2 cm wide on writing paper with lines on only one side.<br>
Hold the strip by each end and half twist it, i.e. twist it by 180<sup>o</sup>.<br>
Note that you could twist it to the left or to the right.<br>
Use adhesive tape to stick the two ends together to make a loop.<br>
Hold the paper strip against the point of a pencil then draw a line along the middle of the strip without taking the pencil off the paper.<br>
Keep drawing the line until you get back to where you started.<br>
Examine both sides of the strip of paper and note that you have drawn on both sides of the paper.<br>
Use sharp scissors to cut along the line.<br>
Note that you now have a new loop twice as long as the original loop.<br>
3. Using a longer strip of writing paper 2 cm wide, repeat the above experiment with a full twist, 360<sup>o</sup>.<br>
Again cut along the a line in the middle of the strip to produce two separate loops, the same size as before, but linked together like a link is in a chain.<br>
4. This loop was discovered by August Ferdinand Mobius and Johann Benedict Listing in 1858, but the ancient Greeks may have known it.<br>
The mobius strip seems to be useless, but it has been used in car fan belts, conveyor belts and continuous loop recording tapes to double the playing time.<br>

Einstein was right, e = mc<sup>2</sup><br>
Albert Einstein's celebrated formula e = mc<sup>2</sup> has finally been corroborated, thanks to a mighty computational effort by French, German and Hungarian physicists.<br>
A brain power consortium led by Laurent Lellouch, of France's Centre for Theoretical Physics, using some of the world's most powerful supercomputers, has set down the calculations for estimating the mass of protons and neutrons, the particles at the nucleus of atoms.<br>
According to the conventional model of particle physics, protons and neutrons comprise smaller particles known as quarks, which are bound by gluons.<br>
The odd thing is the mass of gluons is zero and the mass of quarks is 5 per cent.<br>
Where is the missing 95 per cent?<br>
The answer, according to the study published in US journal <i>Science</i>, comes from the energy from the movements and interactions of quarks and gluons.<br>
In other words, energy and mass are equivalent, as Einstein proposed in his "Special Theory of Relativity" in 1905.<br>
The e = mc<sup>2</sup> formula shows that mass can be converted into energy, and energy can be converted into mass.<br>
By showing how much energy would be released if a certain amount of mass were to be converted into energy, the equation has been used many times, most famously as the basis for atomic weapons.<br>
Resolving e = mc<sup>2</sup> at the scale of sub-atomic particles in equations called quantum chromodynamics to has been difficult.<br>
"Until now, this has been a hypothesis," France's National Centre for Scientific Research said proudly in a statement.<br>
"It has now been corroborated for the first time."<br>
For those keen for more, the computations involve "envisioning space and time as part of a four-dimensional crystal lattice, with discrete points spaced along columns and rows".<br>

Einstein wrote: "If a body emits the energy L in the form of radiation, its mass decreases by L/V<sup>2</sup>.<br>
Here it is obviously inessential that the energy taken from the body turns into radiant energy, so we are lead to the more general conclusion.<br>
The mass of a body is a measure of its energy content; if the energy changes by L, the mass changes in the same sense by L/9 x 10<sup>20</sup> if the energy is measured in ergs and the mass in grams."<br>
In these units, speed of light = 3 X 10<sup>10</sup> cm per second, and speed of light squared = 9 X 10<sup>20</sup>.<br>
Substitute E for L, and c for V, then mass, m, decreases by E/c<sup>2</sup>, E= mc<sup>2</sup>.<br>

This standard is quoted as 100 degrees of proof, 100<sup>o</sup>.<br>
If a spirituous liquor is p% overproof (above standard strength, contains more alcohol than proof spirit), it contains as much alcohol in 100 vol as in 100 + p vol of proof spirit.<br>

So the fundamental interval is 180 Fahrenheit degrees,180<sup>o</sup>F.<br>
The Fahrenheit scale is still used in USA.<br>

<a href="Commercial.html#ThermometersH">Thermometers</a> (Commercial).<br>
The Celsius temperature scale, proposed in 1724 (Anders Celsius 1701-1744), has graduations on the thermometer based on a lower fixed point of 0<sup>o</sup>C, the freezing point of water, and an upper fixed point of 100<sup>o</sup>C the boiling point of water.<br>
So the fundamental interval is 100 Celsius degrees.<br>
The Celsius scale was formerly called the centigrade scale, "100 steps"scale.<br>
Some people still incorrectly quote temperatures in "degrees centigrade".<br>
C = "Celsius" NOT "Centigrade".<br>
The unit "degree Celsius" is equal to the unit "kelvin", and a temperature interval may also be expressed in "degrees Celsius".<br>
To convert the Fahrenheit scale to the Celsius scale (F-32) / 9 = C / 5.<br>
 So 68<sup>o</sup>F = 20<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
The Celsius and Fahrenheit scales have the same value at -40<sup>o</sup>C, or -40<sup>o</sup>F.<br>

<a href="Commercial.html#ThermometersH">Thermometers</a> (Commercial).<br>
The Kelvin scale (Lord Kelvin 1824 - 1907) is based on the idea of absolute zero.<br>
Molecular motion, heat, approaches zero, the null point, as the temperature approaches -273.15<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
One kelvin degree, 1 K = 1 Celsius degree, 1<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
Absolute zero = -273.15<sup>o</sup>C = 0K, not "degree Kelvin".<br>
To convert the Celsius scale to the Kelvin scale, add 273.15.<br>
For example, 0<sup>o</sup>C = 273.15 K, 100<sup>o</sup>C = 373.15 K, and 10<sup>o</sup>C = 283.15 K.<br>
So this scale begins at absolute zero and increases in kelvins.<br>
The Kelvin scale is the preferred scale for scientific experiments.<br>
The temperature, kelvin, is the fraction 1 / 273.16 of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water.<br>
Proposed alternative definition of temperature, kelvin:<br>
The kelvin is such that the Boltzmann constant is exactly 1.3806505 ×10<sup>-23</sup>joules per kelvin.<br>
An approximate value of absolute zero may be obtained by plotting pressure versus temperature and extrapolating the line produced to zero pressure.<br>
Experiment<br>
Submerge the bulb of a pressure gauge successively in boiling water (100°C), ice water (0°C), and dry ice in alcohol (-78.5°C) and record the corresponding pressure indicated by the gauge.<br>

 All readings are between 2.461 and 2.467, so the true value of the diameter of the cylinder is unlikely to be outside these limits.<br>
 The probable value is the mean, 2.464 cm.<br>
 So the greatest probable error is 0.003 cm.<br>
 The diameter of the iron cylinder is 2.464 ± 0.003 cm.<br>
 However, this result probably overestimates the error.<br>
 The error is more accurately calculated by using the formula 3Σ r / n √n.<br>
  [(3 × Σ r) / (8 × sqrt 8)]<br>
 3Σ r / n √n = (3 × 0.015) / (8 × √8) = 0.002<br>
 The diameter of the iron cylinder is 2.464 ± 0.002 cm.<br>
 Order of accuracy is usually expressed in round numbers: 0.002 in 2.464, 2 in 2, 464, 1 in 1, 232, 1 in 1, 200.<br>
 When the iron cylinder was measured, the order of accuracy of the measurements was 1 in 1, 200.<br>

 (1.) Observations should be as accurate as possible, unaffected by preconceived ideas.<br>
 Measurements are more precise if several measurements agree closely.<br>
 The accuracy of measurement is limited by the smallest unit on the measuring instrument, e.g. using a ruler marked in millimetres (mm), if the average of several measurements is 174.5 mm.<br>
 The reading is between 174 mm and 175 mm and the absolute error is +-0.5 mm.<br>
 (2.) Significant figures are all the figures that can be read with meaning from an instrument.<br>
 Significant figures of a number are the digits that contribute to its value.<br>
 Significant figures - all the figures that can be read with meaning from an instrument<br>
 For measurement, the significant figures are those you know with certainty plus the digit that is uncertain.<br>
 A "2 tonne truck" could weigh between 1.5 and 2.5 tonnes.<br>
 A reading of 25 cm could have a value between 24.5 and 25.5 cm.<br>
 So you say that the last digit is uncertain.<br>
 You count zeros between integers and zeros to the right of the decimal point following non zero integers.<br>
 You do not count other zeros.<br>
 The following examples each have four significant figures:<br>
 0.01 234<br>
 0.1 023<br>
 0.1 230<br>
 In the last case you are saying that the reading is closer to 0.1 230 than 0.1 229 or 0.1 231.<br>
 So be careful about zeros, especially the last zero.<br>
 (3.) If rounding off to 3 significant figures:<br>
 4.657 becomes 4.66, because 7 &gt; 5.<br>
 4.655 becomes 4.66, because last digit is 5 and digit behind it is odd.<br>
 4.645 becomes 4.64, because last digit is 5 and digit behind it is even.<br>
 4.654 becomes 4.64, because 4 &lt; 5. 3.<br>
 When adding or subtracting, all numbers must have the same number of digits after the decimal point.<br>
 This is equal to the least number of digits after the decimal point of any number in the addition or subtraction.<br>
 19.43 + 6.456 + 101.9 becomes 19.4 + 6.5 + 101.9 =127.8.<br>
 (4.) When multiplying or dividing numbers, the answer can have only as many significant figures as the number with the least number of significant figures.<br>
 17.9 × 4.3 = 76.97 Answer = 77 (4.3 has only 2 significant figures).<br>
(5.) Significant figures are one way of indicating the uncertainty of a measurement, but many scientists are not bothered with them and use absolute uncertainty to indicate uncertainty.<br>
Other scientists use an extra 'guard digit' in deciding the number of significant figures.<br>
Different rules may be taught in maths and physics class and there may be a difference for 'rounding' rules.<br>

 Standard form or scientific notation expresses a number as a product of a number between 1 and 10 and a power of 10.<br>
 It is a convenient way to express large and small numbers for easy comparison and show the number of significant figures.<br>
 So you can write 18 000 as 1.8 × 10<sup>4</sup> (2 significant figures, i.e. the value is between 1.7 and 1.9 × 10<sup>4</sup>),<br>
 or 1.80 × 10<sup>4</sup> (3 significant figures, i.e. the value is between 1.79 and 1.81 × 10<sup>4</sup>).<br>
 Express decimal fractions in standard form: 0.1 = 1 × 10<sup>-1</sup>, 0.019 = 1.9 × 10<sup>-2</sup> Standard form (scientific notation), e.g. 8.04 × 10<sup>2</sup>, shows 
 the significant figures unambiguously.<br>
 The coefficient, 8.04, must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10.<br>
 The base number 10 is written in exponent form, so in 8.04 × 10<sup>2</sup>, the number 2 is the exponent or power of  ten.<br>
 Express decimal fractions in standard form, e.g.<br>

 The ice point temperature, 273.15 K, is the temperature when equilibrium exists between ice and water at standard pressure.<br>
 It is the lower fixed point of the Celsius scale.<br>
 2. For all substances, as pressure is lowered, the boiling temperature falls much more rapidly than does the freezing temperature.<br>
 For water, the freezing temperature rises slightly at low pressure.<br>
 The boiling temperature and freezing temperature are equal at the low pressure of 611 Pa (0.006 × times atmospheric pressure), pure water boils and freezes 0.01<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 The combination 611 Pa, and 0.01<sup>o</sup>C is called the triple point of water, because at this pressure and temperature ice, liquid water, and steam can coexist in equilibrium.<br>
