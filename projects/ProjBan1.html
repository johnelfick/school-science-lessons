<a name="1.0H"></a>1.0 Banana project<br>
The aim of this projects is provide advice to teachers and students for their school banana project.<br>
The modern cultivated banana is a hybrid from <i>Musa acuminata</i> (AA) and <i>Musa balbisiana</i> (BB), family Musaceae.<br>
It is usually a sterile triploid (3n): AAA dessert and cooking bananas, AAB plantains, ABB cooking bananas.<br>
The stem, called a pseudostem is tightly packed concentric layers of leaf-sheaths.<br>
It can produce a bunch bananas before dying and then being replaced by another pseudostem.<br>
The female flowers produce the fruit, without fertilization or pollination, as clusters of fruits, called “hands”.<br>
The cultivated banana fruit is a seedless berry.<br>
The usual banana fruit, called a "banana" or a "finger", contains 75 % water, 21 % carbohydrate, and 1 % fat, protein, fibre and ash.<br>

 Discuss the site for a banana project with the school principal, local community and an agriculture extension officer.<br>
 Prepare to first take the students to several unsuitable places then take them to see the place you have already chosen for planting the bananas.<br>
 1. The banana is a tropical plant and benefits from moderate heat, adequate moisture and protection from wind.<br>
 Bananas flourish best when they receive full sunlight for most of the day.<br>
 A warm sheltered spot with a north to easterly aspect protected from cold westerly and southerly winds should be selected.<br>
 The minimum temperature for growth is 14<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 Frosts will kill the leaves and sometimes plants.<br>
 Periods of cold weather with temperatures below 13<sup>o</sup>C will cause chilling injury to fruit.<br>
 The fruit then develop a dull appearance.<br>
 The leaves of plants affected by cold conditions (&lt, 10<sup>o</sup>C to 12<sup>o</sup>C), can turn yellow and bunch size is reduced.<br>
2. The place you choose for the banana project should have the following properties:<br>
* Be near the school, on flat land or land sloping towards the North<br>
* Water table is not too deep, because you will plant about 1 metre above the water table<br>
* Sunny all day, not shaded by big trees<br>
* Sheltered from strong winds, e.g. sheltered, but not shaded by buildings or trees<br>
* Annual rainfall more than 1200 mm during 12 months<br>
* Deep soil with plenty of plant nutrients, not sandy soils or clay soil<br>
* Soil pH between 5 and 6.3.<br>
* Choose land that has not grown bananas for two years to avoid by pests and diseases left behind by the old banana plants.<br>
 Do not use land that has wild bananas growing on it or where there are dead banana plants.<br>
3. Clear the bush two months before planting, but leave some trees on the windy side as a windbreak, or plant Leucaena.<br>
 On the flat land the bush should be burnt, but this may cause soil erosion from rain on sloping land so leave some plant cover there.<br>
 Plant a cover crop to protect the soil and shade any grass and weeds, e.g. cowpea, pigeon pea, velvet bean, Crotalaria, Pueraria.<br>
 Plant at least 4 m apart, but planting distances depends on the fertility of the soil and on the size of the variety.<br>
 Ask an agriculture extension officer for advice on planting distance.<br>
 Plants should be grown closer on fertilized or richer soils and further apart on unfertilized or poorer soils.<br>
4. In some places you are not allowed to plant bananas near houses or dormitories, because some people say they attract mosquitoes.<br>
On atolls, the side of an old pit for giant swamp taro (Cyrtosperma merkusii), is a good place or you can dig a special planting hole in another place.<br>
 You may find a suitable place sheltered by coconuts, or by a house, or by bushes on the lagoon side of an atoll.<br>
 The exposed windy side of an atoll near the ocean is not a good place.<br>
5. Banana plants grow best in well-drained, not swampy, deep soil that has good moisture retention and is rich in plant foods and organic matter.<br>
 Light sandy soils require considerable mulching to improve water retention, and nutrients are quickly leached from this type of soil.<br>
 Although bananas like ample water, they will not tolerate waterlogging.<br>
 Roots start to die after an hour in flooded soils.<br>
 Examples of planting distances<br>
 Variety, Distance apart on the square<br>
 Dwarf Cavendish, 2 m<br>
 Giant Cavendish, 3 m<br>
 Mons Mari, 3 m Williams, 3 m Lady Finger, 4 m.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="1.2H"></a>1.2 Banana terminology<br>
 The "Debelling" is cutting off the banana flower, called the "bell".<br>
 A "finger" is a single banana fruit.<br>
 A "finger stalk" is the stalk attaching the finger to the hand.<br>
 A "hand" is a cluster of bananas from a single flower group at a node 
forming a section of the bunch, because bananas grow in layers around the stalk.<br>
 A" bunch" is the whole flowering stem (inflorescence), bearing hands, fruit clusters, of several fingers of fruit.<br>
 So a bunch with nine layers of bananas is called a "nine hand bunch".<br>
 When marketing bananas, a bunch is called a "stem".<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="1.3H"></a>1.3 Village bananas and cultivated bananas<br>
 | <a href="../images/51.1.gif">See diagram 51.1</a>: Cultivated and "village" banana plant.<br>
 | <a href="../images/51.4.gif">See diagram 51.4</a>: Wild bananas, cultivated banana, plantain<br>
 Bananas can be grown on atolls, but it needs special care to make them grow well.<br>
 The aim of this project is to show how to increase the yield of bananas and grow bananas for profit.<br>
 You will need examples of village and cultivated bananas or use the diagrams.<br>
 There are hundreds of different kinds of bananas, but in this it is important that you teach the difference between traditional, (wild), bananas and cultivated bananas, <i>Musa acuminata</i>.<br>
 What are the different kinds of bananas used at home? What are the different uses of village bananas?<br>
 There are two main kinds of bananas, traditional bananas and cultivated bananas.<br>
 Traditional bananas grow wild and are easy to grow.<br>
 Cultivated bananas were introduced from other countries.<br>
 They are harder to grow, but they produce more fruit.<br>
 Cultivated bananas may be quite different from traditional or village bananas.<br>
 They may be genetically different.<br>
 They may have higher yield than village bananas if they are fertilized and cared for properly.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="1.4H"></a>1.4 Varieties of bananas<br>
<a href="../biology/UNBiolN3MN.html#Musasp</a>Musaceae</a>, banana family<br>
Bananas may have originated in Malaysia, but in 327 BC Alexander the Great took some back to Europe.<br>
Arab people took them to Africa, and Spanish or Portuguese people took them to North America.<br>
Musa acuminata ssp. banksii, one of original wild species before cultivated varieties, Australian native food, fruit not well developed, but trunk eaten after cooking on hot stones, Australia, Musaceae.<br>
 1. Cavendish variety, British Lord Cavendish grew them in Kew Gardens, London, now about 95% of bananas in Australia.<br>
 "Pacific Coast Eco Bananas" produces a Cavendish variety, grown with minimum chemicals and fruit ends dipped in hot wax. Musaceae.<br>
<a href="../images/Bananawax.jpg">See diagram</a>: "Eco bananas"<br>
Dwarf Cavendish variety trees fall over if not propped up, then the fruit splits down the side and lose fruit to rats and fruit bats, probably, because it splits.<br>
Give dwarf bananas 3 large handfuls of 10-3-8 Eco88 every 3 months.<br>
Prop up the tree, because the weight of the bunch is too heavy for the tree.<br>
Too many suckers will make the plant higher and higher and will grow out of the ground.<br>
Use nematicides on Dwarf Cavendish trees, applied in granular form, because of their danger to the operator if taken in by oral or dermal ways.<br>
Fertiliser used causes soil acidity where lime or dolomite is used periodically to correct it.<br>
The rate depends on the pH and the soil type.<br>
Ethylene is used to initiate ripening.<br>
Eat Dwarf Cavendish when they only have a little bit of yellow on them.<br>
If after cutting your bunch down, hang them upside down so when the banana ripens, it does not fall off.<br>

 2. Lady Finger variety, (Sugar banana, Sucrier, Ninos, Bocadillos, fig banana, date banana)<br>
<a href="../images/Bananalady.jpg">See diagram</a>: Lady Finger variety<br>
 The smaller, sweeter "Lady Finger" banana, 4% of the Australian market, suitable for fruit salads, because they do not go brown when cut.<br>
 Skin is thin and flesh is very sweet, 12 - 20 fingers on each hand, each bunch with 10-14 hands.<br>
 Best eaten fresh or used in desserts, because they are much sweeter than Cavendish, similar variety is "Goldfinger", Musaceae.<br>

 5. Pisang Ceylan variety (Pisang Ceylon), Musa acuminata, attractive plant, maroon and black markings on leaves, sweet, silky dessert fruit with creamy texture, popular in India, sold as rhizome, Musaceae.<br>
The fruiting bunches on this variety at the moment are huge.<br>
This lovely variety have attractive pink midribs on the leaves and an agreeable sweet acid flavour to the delicious fruit.<br>
This variety also seems to do particularly well in the Western Suburbs of Brisbane.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="1.5H"></a>1.5 Grow bananas at home, residential plantations<br>
 Residential plantations are defined as those bananas not grown for commercial purposes.<br>
 Residential banana farmers must comply with current biosecurity legislation.<br>
 Only certain banana varieties may be allowed on residential plantations in certain areas.<br>
 In Queensland, Australia, there are no longer any restrictions on the varieties permitted or number of plants for home cultivation.<br>
 From 2016-07-1, a permit is no longer required to grow banana plants in Queensland, provided they are tissue cultured plantlets purchased from a QBAN accredited nursery, but home farmers are still not allowed to grow ornamental bananas.<br>
 Current stock in QBAN accredited nurseries (2016-12-03), include the following varieties:<br>
 Cavendish, Bluggoe, Ladyfinger, Ducasse, Pisang Ceylan, Blue Java, Pacific Plantain, Red Dacca, Dwarf Red Dacca, Goldfinger, Pisang Mas, Senorita,<br>
 but not Dwarf Cavendish or Dwarf Ladyfinger.<br>
 The Department of Primary Industries (DPI), Queensland has warned nursery operators and residential farmers about the illegal sale and purchase of banana plants.<br>
 Investigations have also revealed that purchasers were not in receipt of an inspector's approval allowing them to move and plant the banana plants.<br>
 Nursery owners who sell plants to people without approvals and residential farmers buying and planting banana plants without approval could face fines.<br>
 To transplant any bananas, including Ladyfingers, in your backyard you need to obtain a free planting approval from the DPI.<br>
 This will be issued if source material is acceptable and the plants are permitted varieties for the area.<br>
 Residential plantings are those bananas not grown for commercial purposes.<br>
 Residential farmers may plant a maximum of 10 plants of permitted banana varieties, but only after obtaining written approval.<br>
 The only permitted varieties for residential farmers in southern Queensland are as follows:<br>
 Ladyfinger, Blue Java, Ducasse, Goldfinger, Bluggoe (plantain or cooking bananas), and Kluai Namwa Khom (Dwarf Ducasse), and Pisang Ceylan.<br>
 The reason behind only being able to plant these varieties is that all banana plants, including Ladyfinger, are susceptible to Banana Bunchy Top Virus.<br>
 The varieties identified for residential use grow taller making them easier to see when conducting residential property inspections for the disease.<br>
 Varieties such as Ladyfinger tend to show the bunchy top virus symptoms clearly as opposed to Cavendish varieties.<br>
 Banana plants are also susceptible to Panama disease, a soil-borne fungus often moved in infested planting material.<br>
 In some countries with a developed banana industry, it is illegal to grow bananas at home in the ground or in pots.<br>
 You may need permission to up to a maximum of 10 banana plants or 30 pseudostems of approved varieties for a residential plantation.<br>
 Bananas grown in the home need bright diffused light, warmth, the right kind of food and attention once they are in fruit.<br>
 In temperate countries, bananas are relatively free of pests.<br>
 To grow bananas as an indoor plant, you need a sun porch, a greenhouse or a room with good light.<br>
 Bees are unnecessary to produce fruit.<br>
 Plant outdoors in the summer on a wheeled caddy, but drag it indoors before the first frost.<br>
 Bananas are not frost-tolerant plants.<br>
 Temperatures below 0<sup>o</sup>C will kill off the foliage.<br>
 Below 5<sup>o</sup>C the rhizome will die.<br>
 Some non fruiting species, e.g. <i>Musa basjoo</i>, will take much colder weather.<br>
 Banana plants do well in the same narrow air temperature range that humans enjoy most.<br>
 The optimum temperatures are between 20<sup>o</sup>C and 27<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 Below 20<sup>o</sup>C bananas may stop growing, because the roots must be kept warm.<br>
 Do not expose the plant to temperatures greater than 30<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 However, the plant will not die if it has sufficient water.<br>
 Timing of fruit production is related to leaf output, so slowed growth from being too cool or too hot retards leaf emergence and delays fruiting.<br>
 During high temperatures, plants in pots can be taken indoors.<br>
 The plant needs sun or other light on its leaves and warm roots.<br>
 A dark heat-retaining pot and a gravel or black plastic mulch can boost soil temperature.<br>
 Night time drops in temperature or low humidity do not seem to affect fruiting types of bananas, but they take them longer to produce fruit.<br>
 Fruiting bananas are seedless, so they reproduce either by rhizomes or suckers that sprout from the base of a mature stalk, called "pups".<br>
 Tissue-cultured plantlets have been pathogen tested, making them ideal for use in residential plantations.<br>
 These suckers are what you generally get when you purchase banana plants from nurseries.<br>
 They should be planted soon after purchase.<br>
 The most suitable planting mixes generally have the sandy loam quality that bananas like best.<br>
 Start planting in big container, or plan on potting up within three months.<br>
 These are fast growing plants that ultimately need at least a 15 gallon size container.<br>
 Choose a dwarf variety, e.g. Dwarf Cavendish, about 4 feet at maturity and is recommended for indoor planting.<br>
 Bananas are heavy feeders, with potassium and nitrogen the key nutrients.<br>
 Combine a good organic 5-5-5 fertilizer with a generous side dressing of a natural potassium source, e.g. kelp meal.<br>
 Mix about 1/3 cup of the organic 5-5-5 when first planting the banana in 20 litre container, then add more when potting up into a 55 litre container.<br>
 Feed generously during the warm weather months.<br>
 Container grown bananas planted in potting soil should be fed small doses of organic fertilizer with every second watering.<br>
 There is a direct correlation between nutrient availability early in a young banana plant s life and the number and quality of fruits produced.<br>
 Bananas can be burnt by over fertilization with chemical fertilizers.<br>
 Never let a banana in a pot to dry out.<br>
 For bananas in the ground, water at least once a week in extremely hot weather.<br>
 Cultivation is the same as growing banana plants in the ground.<br>
 After all the fingerling bananas have formed, cut off the huge maroon flower otherwise it will sap energy that is better used to develop fruit.<br>
 Support the fruiting stalk by propping it up with two pieces of crossed bamboo or lumber to leave the fruiting stalk hanging down.<br>
 To speed ripening, cover the bunch with a white or blue plastic bag.<br>
 Keep offshoots, or pups, down to one or two in the pot along with the main stalk.<br>
 After the plant has fruited, discard the stalk that bore the bunch and cut off the pups, leaving any roots attached, then re-pot each individual remaining chunk.<br>
 Ripe bananas will have achieved a full colour and will have rounded out between the longitudinal ridges of the skin.<br>
 Immature bananas have an angular look.<br>
 Finish ripening them in a bag with an apple.<br>
 However, if the fruit starts to split, harvest them immediately without waiting for the full colouring.<br>
 Remove one hand at a time to test for maturity without using a whole bunch.<br>
 After harvest, cut down the stalk about 100 cm above the ground to avoid non-producing plants competing for nutrients.<br>
 Banana behaves like a tropical weed.<br>
 Some farmers cut down the fruiting stalk with the fruit still attached to save the work of climbing a ladder and lowering a heavy bunch.<br>
 When cutting the stalk, remember that juices from the cut may cause a brown stain on clothes and may irritate the skin.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="2.1H"></a>2.1 Leaf<br>
</a><a href="../images/51.2.gif">See diagram 51.2</a>: Banana leaf<br>
 You will need a banana leaf in the classroom, or take students outside to see a banana plant.<br>
 Draw a whole banana leaf and include the following four parts:<br>
 1. The large flat leaf blade, the lamina, that has many small veins that run close together.<br>
 2. The thick strong middle of the leaf, the midrib.<br>
 3. The strong leaf stalk, the petiole, that holds the leaf up to the sun.<br>
 4. The thick elongated part of the leaf stalk, the leaf sheath.<br>
 The end of the leaf sheath is the leaf base.<br>
 A leaf will stop it making food by photosynthesis if:<br>
 1. strong winds blow the leaf off the plant<br>
 2. the leaf is eaten by insects or other animals<br>
 3. the leaf is killed by a disease<br>
 4. a creeper or vine grows over a leaf and stops the sun shining on it.<br>
 The leaf edges may tear or break in a strong wind.<br>
 This does not hurt the leaf much.<br>
 When a leaf is old, it may have many breaks in it.<br>
 The banana leaf is designed to tear along the veins.<br>
 Three is some evidence that photosynthesis by the leaf increases after mild tearing and the parts of the leaf are flapping in the wind.<br>
 However, severely torn leaves may cause desiccation of the plant.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="2.2H"></a>2.2 Leaf growth<br>
<a href="../images/51.3.gif">See diagram 51.3</a>: Growth of banana plant<br>
 You will need a banana plant in the classroom, or take the students to see a banana plant.<br>
 The banana plant needs 8 to 9 green leaves before it will make the flowers that turn into the fruit.<br>
 New leaves are made as the older leaves die and hang down.<br>
 Note the number of leaves on a banana plant.<br>
 Record the length and width of some big leaves.<br>
 The banana "tree" is really a collection of big leaves.<br>
 The leaf stalks, petioles, of the leaves wrap around each other to form a false stem, pseudostem.<br>
 The real stem and roots are underground.<br>
 The youngest leaf grows up through the middle of the plant.<br>
 At first, the leaf is rolled up, but later it opens and hangs down.<br>
 Later, a flowering stem, inflorescence, grows up from the underground item.<br>
 The flowering stem grows out the top in the middle of the plant, turns down and produces flowers and fruit.<br>
 After the flowering stem appears, no more leaves can grow.<br>
 From the underground stem buds grow to form new shoots, suckers.<br>
 Suckers grow to form the next "trees".<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="2.3H"></a>2.3 False stem (pseudostem)<br>
</a><a href="../images/51.2.gif">See diagram 51.3</a>: Leaf bases<br>
 The false stem of bananas may be called a "pseudostem".<br>
 You will need an old banana stem that has died or a stem from which the bunch of fruit has been cut.<br>
 Use an axe or a bush knife to cut off a piece of this stem about 30 cm long.<br>
 Be careful, because spiders and other animals that can bite you may be living in the false stem!<br>
 The "stem" is really a collection of leaf bases wrapped around each other, so it is a " false stem" (pseudostem).<br>
 It is the "trunk" of the "tree".<br>
 Draw the cut end of a stem.<br>
 See the leaf bases wrapped around each other.<br>
 Take off the leaf sheaths or leaf bases one by one until you can see there is no stem inside.<br>
 You may see a small hard piece of the flower stalk in the centre.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.0H"></a>3.0 Corm<br>
</a><a href="../images/51.5.gif">See diagram 51.5</a>: Banana corm (VS, vertical section)<br>
 You will need a corm of an old banana plant<br>
 The true stem of the banana plant is an underground stem, a rhizome.<br>
 The thick part is the corm.<br>
 The corm makes shoots that grow into branches or other corms.<br>
 New plants come from these shoots.<br>
 The branches and suckers grow very close together to form a clump, a rootstock with many shoots.<br>
 It is difficult to see the shape of the corm so cut off a piece of corm by putting a spade or a bush knife between a strong sucker and the side of the main plant.<br>
 Wash it and cut off some roots.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.0H"></a>4.0 Rhizome<br>
</a><a href="../images/51.2.gif"> See diagram 51.2</a>: Banana.<br>
 The "stem" of the banana is a false stem (pseudostem).<br>
 The true stem is an underground stem, a rhizome.<br>
 The swollen stem base is a corm with very short internodes.<br>
 The corm makes shoots that grow into branches or other corms.<br>
 New plants come from these shoots.<br>
 Suckers grow from the dormant buds, the "eyes" on the corm.<br>
 Each sucker formed is higher than the corm it came from.<br>
 When the land is sloping, the suckers are usually formed on the uphill side, so generations of banana plants will gradually move up a hill.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="5.0H"></a>5.0 Roots<br>
 Just before the class, you will need to cut off a piece of corm with roots.<br>
 The roots of the banana plant are shallow, not deep in the soil.<br>
 The plant can be easily blown over by a strong wind.<br>
 Do not dig deeply close to the plant, because you may cut the shallow roots.<br>
 Cutting off weeds with a bush knife is better than trying to dig them out deeply and damaging the roots.<br>
 Roots near the surface of the soil may become dry if there is no rain.<br>
 So use as mulch dead leaves and dead grass on top of soil to keep the surface soil moist.<br>
 Dig around the growing corm to find some shallow roots.<br>

 | <a href="../images/51.7.4.gif">See diagram 51.7.4</a>: Succulent fruit - berry, Wild banana, Cultivated banana<br>
 The inflorescence is the arrangement of flowers on their axis and to each other.<br>
 You will need a banana plant with fruit on it.<br>
 If there is no fruit ready to see, teach this later when the fruit bunch is growing up.<br>
 The axis of the flowering stem, inflorescence, is the stalk.<br>
 The flowers are covered by purple bracts, small leaves or leaf scales that lift then shed as the flower grows.<br>
 The flowering stem before the bracts have lifted is the "bud".<br>
 Individual flowers appear and develop from bisexual flowers to male or female flowers by losing their male or female organs.<br>
 The female flowers develop into the clusters of seedless fruits without need of pollination.<br>
 The male flower is at the end of the stalk, with a thin leaf like covering, is the "bell" ("flower", "navel").<br>
 The female flowers further up the stalk become banana fruit.<br>
 When the fruit is very small, it is angular and does not have much stored food inside.<br>
 The curve of long fruits occurs, because the fruit tip grows upward against the downward pull of gravity.<br>
 The usual stage for cutting for transporting some distance to market or for export is green fruit with the angles still just showing.<br>
 When the angles have disappeared, the fruit is at the " round full bunch" stage and should be eaten soon.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.0H"></a>7.0 Prepare ground<br>
</a><a href="../images/51.9.gif">See diagram 51.9</a>: Planting banana<br>
 You will need digging tools, bush knives, compost, fine black soil, dead leaves, coconut husks.<br>
 Prepare ground well in advance.<br>
 Choose a wind-protected, full-sun position with fertile soil, rich in organic matter, well-drained, not compacted, and pH about 6.5.<br>
 Get advice from an agriculture extension officer about using chemical herbicides for preparing ground, e.g. glyphosate weedicide.<br>
 Clear the land around the planting places, cutting down weeds and bushes.<br>
 The ground should become "clean weeded" no weeds at all.<br>
 Dig the holes about 3 - 5 m apart and 60 cm or 2 spade blades deep and wide, or 300 mm square and 250 mm deep.<br>
 Fill the bottom of the planting hole with coconut husks and dead leaves and some fine sand.<br>
 They must push the sand down into the spaces between the husks so the soil is quite firm.<br>
 Fill with rotten compost and legume cover crops, e.g. cowpea or Crotalaria, because organic matter increases beneficial micro-organisms in the soil<br>
 If you leave the holes open, make sure that people do not fall into them.<br>
 On top of this put a small heap of compost mixed with fine black soil.<br>
 The planting material will be planted into this soil and compost mixture.<br>
 Add some pig manure or sprinkle a matchbox full of mixed fertilizer.<br>
 Add 200 g dolomite and 150 g fertilizer, e.g. "Nitrophoska" or "Rustica", thoroughly into the soil.<br>
 Irrigate thoroughly for a few days prior to planting.<br>
Mound the soil up and then dig a hole so the plant will be higher than the surrounding ground.<br>
This position minimize water pooling around the base of the plant and drowning of the roots.<br>

</a><a href="../images/51.10.gif">See diagram 51.10</a>: Planting material, bit, peeper, sucker<br>
Use a large plant to show how to cut off the different kinds of planting material.<br>
 Try to obtain planting material from an agriculture extension officer or a tissue culture laboratory.<br>
 The planting material must be clean.<br>
 It should not have any holes or spots on it due to insects or disease.<br>
 The different kinds of planting material, sets:<br>
 1. Pieces of corm ("bits"), each have a bud ("eye").<br>
 A bit is a piece of the rhizome or short underground stem of the plant trimmed to a single mature bud or eye.<br>
 To obtain bits for planting, select a well grown healthy plant that is at least 6 months old and has not bunched.<br>
 Remove the plant roots from the rhizome, split the rhizome and attached pseudostem (plant stem) in sections so that each piece has a prominent centrally placed eye.<br>
 Bits must be planted in the soil the same way up as it was when cut off.<br>
 Bits grow slowly.<br>
 2. Get a whole banana plant and identify the different kinds of suckers.<br>
* Water suckers are small plants with broad leaves that will not produce well.<br>
* Sword suckers, arrowheads, have long thin first leaves that are more vigorous and more productive.<br>
 Chose suckers growing against the mother plant, not growing away from it.<br>
 Cut suckers away from the mother plant by pushing a spade or knife down between the sucker and the main stem.<br>
 A sucker is an offshoot from the parent plant.<br>
 The best suckers are about 45 to 60 cm tall, or up to 1 metre high and at least 15 cm across, and have narrow "sword" leaves.<br>
 Small suckers with spindly stems and broad, flattened leaves lack vigour and should not be used for planting.<br>
 Suckers with broad leaves, "water shoots", are useless for planting and should be removed and burnt.<br>
 If small suckers, "peepers", must be used for planting material, they must include a piece of corm at the bottom.<br>
* To transplant larger suckers, cut off all, but six of the large green leaves.<br>
* For trimming the suckers, use a large with a sharp knife to remove the roots so that you can see the white corm.<br>
 Use a small knife to cut out any red brown spots or tunnels caused by pests.<br>
 Work quickly, because the cut corm will darken in the air so you cannot see the spots.<br>
* Store the planting material in a shady, dry place, e.g. under a house.<br>
Leave the suckers there for four days until the cut surface of the corms have healed over.<br>
If the sucker is planted soon after it is cut off, the corm may rot and die.<br>
* To avoid pests and disease, use tissue-cultured plantlets from accredited nurseries that meet strict pest free and disease hygiene standards.<br>
* Draw the different kinds of planting material.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="8.2H"></a>8.2 Planting<br>
<a href="../images/51.9.gif">See diagram 51.9</a>: Planting banana<br>
1. In southern Queensland, the best time to plant is from September to mid December when rain is more common.<br>
Bananas are usually planted at the beginning of the wet season, but can be planted all year round.<br>
2. The bunch of fruit will be ready for harvest in about 9-10 months.<br>
 The first crop after planting is the "plant crop".<br>
 Later crops from the suckers are the "ratoon crops".<br>
(A ratoon is a new shoot or sprout arising from the base of a crop plant.)>br>
 3. When planting, dig a hole about 300 mm square and 250 mm deep.<br>
 Place well-composted poultry manure and loose soil in the hole.<br>
Then insert the planting piece, so that the junction of the corm and pseudostem of the sucker or bit is about 150 mm below the soil level.<br>
 On sloping sites, the eye should be placed on the uphill side.<br>
 The hole should then be filled with soil and tramped down firmly.<br>
 4. Make a hole in the heap of good soil and compost in the middle of the planting.<br>
 Hold the top of the sucker when you have put it in the hole.<br>
 The bottom of the sucker should be 12 cm below the soil surface.<br>
 Fill in the soil around the sucker.<br>
 Put more soil around the stem.<br>
 Put dead leaves on top of the soil all around the sucker.<br>
 Make sure there is a hole at the top of the planting place so that rain and water will run down to the sucker.<br>
 Tread on the soil around the sucker to make the soil firm.<br>
 Water the soil around the sucker.<br>
 However, water should be applied sparingly after planting until the plants begin to grow.<br>
 If too much water is applied during this period the planting piece may rot.<br>
 Plants are usually spaced 2 m apart, to allows for plenty of sunshine, whilst still enabling you to tie them together for support if required.<br>
 If a large bunch is hanging off a plant, it tends to lean over and may fall over, so it has to be tied to a sturdy structure, or propped.<br>
 5. Plant one sucker first as demonstration then students plant the other suckers.<br>
 6. Avoiding planting in hot, wet weather to avoid rotting in the planting material.<br>
 7. During dry weather plant small suckers or bits in bags or pots and water them every few days for the first two weeks until the root systems are established.<br>
 These potted plants will be stronger and will establish more quickly when they are planted out in the banana garden.<br>
 8. Before planting, the land must be well prepared to ensure food soil contact well and have good drainage as from deep ripping.<br>
 9. If suckers and bits are planted in moist soil in the days after good rain, no more water is needed until the shoots emerge.<br>
 However, in dry areas apply 25 - 50 mm of irrigation soon after planting.<br>
10. Larger planting pieces give better strikes, however the larger pieces have more than one "eye" so the emerging extra shoots must later be cut out.<br>
 11. Leave cut surfaces to air dry for 1-2 days in the shade and form a seal, to avoid cut surfaces on suckers and bits being infected by soil organisms and rot.<br>
 Keep soil away from the cut surfaces.<br>
 9. Plant suckers at 15 cm of soil depth to ensure adequate soil moisture until shoots emerge.<br>
 After covering suckers or bits, firm down the soil with the foot, to improve contact between soil and the planting material.<br>
Divide the base of banana plants into "bits" for propagating new banana plants, with each "bit" having an eye from which the shoot emerges.<br>
 Alternatively, use suckers taken from the side of the clump for establishing new plants.<br>
13. Bury the plant almost halfway up the stem to discourage suckers from emerging too early.<br>
 This action ensures the mother plant is secure so that the suckers don't pull the plant up out of the ground.<br>
 14. Immediately after planting, tissue culture plantlets are at their most vulnerable, because their potting medium is light and the root system is concentrated.<br>
However plants become more stable after about a week, once the roots have spread into the surrounding wet soil. which should remain moist.<br>
 15. Leaf wetting to keep the leaves wet for as long as possible is done at this stage to reduce stress.<br>
Evaporating water cools the leaves, enabling them to photosynthesize at maximum efficiency.<br>
 The tender leaves will wilt and fold very easily during the heat of the day and they may even burn and die back if conditions are severe.<br>
 The entire leaf area should be gently wetted by the irrigation system for about 5 minutes, three times a day, between 10 am and 5 pm.<br>
 This should continue for about 3 weeks until the root system takes over, the leaves harden off and normal transpiration begins.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="8.3H"></a>8.3 Plantlets<br>
"Caring for Banana Plantlets", by Sharon Hamill, Senior Principal Scientist, Horticulture &amp, Forestry Science, Department of Agriculture &amp, Fisheries<br>
 Banana plantlets are fairly hardy and you should easily have success with your little plants, but there are a few important points to follow.<br>
 Plants will not survive if planted directly into pots without hardening them off under high humidity conditions.<br>
 Do not open the lids of the containers until you are ready to plant.<br>
 Get everything ready, including pot labels, before you start.<br>
 You need fine seedling mix that is already wet and a place under shade so the plants can establish under high humidity conditions closed in plastic to start with.<br>
 For keeping high humidity, use a plastic bag over a wire frame over pot tied on with string, or,<br>
 a plastic sheet over a box tied on with string, or,<br> 
 cut off clear plastic soft drink bottles turned upside down.<br>
 The plants need free draining with holes in the bottom of the container.<br>
 Also when the plants are in high humidity they must be grown under shade cloth or they will burn.<br>
 When everything is ready, prepare plants in the shade.<br>
 Get a container of water and make sure it is at room temperature.<br>
 Take tissue culture banana plants from the container (one variety at a time so you don't mix them up), and put them into the water.<br>
 Just separate the plants apart and don't scrape every little piece of agar off the roots.<br>
 Plant the little banana plantlets like seedlings, make a hole in the potting mix, put in the plants and gently firm soil around them.<br>
 Water immediately with a soft shower of water and enclose the plantlets to keep high humidity as quickly as possible to prevent them drying out.<br>
 Use any method that keeps humidity high so you can see condensation inside the cover.<br>
 It is important that the plants be free draining with holes needed in the bottom of the container that the pots or tray sits in.<br>
 Plants must be in natural sunlight, but under one or several layers of shade cloth, depending on the intensity of sun.<br>
 A veranda or windowsill will not provide enough light or warmth for the plants.<br>
 Waters plants in well and check daily by feeling the potting mix before watering.<br>
 Only water as needed and do not put pots in trays of water, because they like to be free draining.<br>
 You may not have to water plants every day, just check them until they do need water.<br>
 If no signs of condensation inside the plastic cover, water the plants.<br>
 When new leaves begin to emerge from the centre of the plant, lower the humidity by punching holes in the plastic or opening the edges.<br>
When plants continue to grow well, remove plastic cover and water with dilute liquid fertilizer, but keep the plants under shade cloth while hardening off.<br>
 Follow a step-by-step process of gradually hardening, growing and fertilizing the plants.<br>
As the plants grow and do not need the high humidity, use bigger pots and add pellets of slow release fertilizer, but do not let the pellets touch the plants.<br>
 Gradually move plants into increasing amounts of sunlight 2 - 3 weeks before planting.<br>
 When the plants are around 30 - 40 cm high, harden them in full sun.<br>
 When fully sun hardened, plant deeply and water very well while they get established.<br>
 Banana plants like full sun, plenty of water, fertilizer and a warm position.<br>
 Make sure you space the plants widely enough apart do that they do not shade each other.<br>
Report on use of tissue-cultured plantlets.<br>
A few years ago, the gardener bought different varieties and has reported as follows:<br>
The outstanding grower was the Dwarf Ducasse.<br>
Being a short grower, the bunch and bell are at head height.<br>
It has just flowered, the bell opening, producing 8 hands with 16 pieces of fruit on each hand, which should be ripe by November.<br>
Some other varieties that did not survive were Dwarf Cavendish and Red Dacca.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="8.4H">8.4</a> Striking bananas from "bits" and "suckers"<br>
1. Avoid planting in hot, wet conditions, as these conditions promote rotting in the planting material.<br>
The drier months of the early spring are the best.<br>
2. Plant bananas at other times of the year by potting them.<br>
Plant small suckers or bits in bags or pots.<br>
Water them every 1-3 days for the first two weeks until the root system is well established.<br>
The potted plants are stronger and establish more quickly after planting.<br>
3. Prepare land with good drainage.<br>
Deep ripping before planting improves the drainage of the soil.<br>
Work the soil needs only until it is fine enough to get good contact with most of the planting material.<br>
4. Suckers and bits do best if planted in moist soil a few days after rain, or apply 25 - 50 mm of irrigation immediately after planting.<br>
No further water should be required until the shoots have emerged.<br>
5. Larger planting pieces give better strikes.<br>
The larger the sucker or bit, the more reliable the emergence of shoots.<br>
However, larger pieces usually have more than one "eye" so the extra shoots which emerge need to be thinned out later.<br>
6. Allow cut surfaces to air-dry for 1-2 days, but not in the sun, because they could dry out too much.<br>
The cut surfaces on suckers and bits can allow infection by soil organisms, causing rotting.<br>
Drying them out a little allows the cut surface to form a "shellac-like" seal, which protects the planting piece against rot-causing organisms.<br>
Keep dirt away from the cut surfaces to reduce the risk of infection.<br>
7. Plant suckers and bits to about 15 cm of soil depth, deep enough to ensure adequate soil moisture until shoots emerge.<br>
After covering suckers or bits, the soil should be firmed down with the foot, to improve contact between soil and the planting material.<br>
8 Plant tissue culture bananas up to their "neck" in the ground.<br>
The "neck" is just below where the leaves start to branch out.<br>
This planting method reduces any problems with plant stability when they started suckering.<br>
9 Soil is still hot from the compost-making may kill initial Lady Finger plants.<br>

Encourage students to visit the banana project each day and note any problems.<br>
Get advice from an agriculture extension officer about using chemical herbicides for weeding, e.g. glyphosate weedicide.<br>
Take the students to see some growing bananas.<br>
Show them different ways to care for bananas and ask them why they should be done.<br>
In some places it is not the custom of the people to do all these things.<br>
The people may feel that the plants can look after themselves.<br>
However, banana farmers say that in the first three to four months, bananas need lots of care, soil moisture and fertilizer for the best growth and fruit production.<br>
This will increase the weight of the first bunch and how many "hands" the banana will have.<br>
Give the plants water, especially when they are young and when there is no rain.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.1H">9.1</a> Bunch covering<br>
<a href="https://www.daleysfruit.com.au/buy/banana-bunch-cover-bag.htm">Banana bunch cover bag</a>, Daleys Fruit Tree Nursery<br>
Bunch covers, banana bags, are made of blue plastic.<br>
They let the fruit ripen evenly and protect the fruit from insects, flying foxes, tree rats and birds.<br>
Cut a hole in the bottom to let the water out.<br>
Place the blue plastic bunch cover around the bunch of fruit when the fruit turns upwards and the last hand is visible.<br>
Bunch covers help to increase the weight and improve the quality of the fruit by avoiding blemishes.<br>
Also, the bunch cover may hold in ethylene close to the fruit to accelerate fruit ripening.<br>
Bunch covers protect the fruit from bird, wind and sun damage, improve its quality and increase the yield.<br>
However they can encourage other pests such as rats, mealy bugs and scale to create nests within the bunch.<br>
The other problem with the commercial covers is that you cannot see through them.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.2H">9.2</a> De-suckering<br>
 | <a href="../images/51.13.1.gif">See diagram 51.13.1</a>: A "stool" of bananas<br>
 | <a href="../images/51.13.2.0.gif">See diagram 51.13.2</a>: Different types of suckers<br>
 | <a href="../images/51.13.2.1.gif">See diagram 51.13.2.1</a>: Suckering cycles<br>
1. Take students to see stands of bananas that have been de-suckered and stands that have not been de-suckered.<br>
Alternatively you could set up a trial where you divide your banana project into two and de-sucker only half the bananas to show the difference in yield.<br>
If the banana plant is just left alone, it will soon be surrounded by many suckers.<br>
These suckers will compete with the mother plant for water and plant food and so the fruit formed by the mother plant will be very small.<br>
All the useless suckers should be cut out before they get too big.<br>
If you do this, you will have a "stool" of bananas that never has more than four plants in it:<br>
* One large plant one bearing fruit<br>
* One smaller plant, but the next to bear fruit<br>
* One medium-sized sucker, and<br>
* One small sucker.<br>
2. To make sure that have only one or two strong suckers for the next generation, allow only one new sucker to grow every three months.<br>
Two strong sword suckers should be selected to bear fruit for the next crop.<br>
One of these can be allowed to grow for the new crop ("follower crop"), when the main stem starts to flower.<br>
The other can be cut out for planting in another project.<br>
The other suckers should be cut out with a digging bar and separated from the root after they are more than 30 cm tall.<br>
3. Use a sharp knife to cut the unwanted suckers off at ground level, scrape out the remains of the sucker and pour in a teaspoon of kerosene.<br>
It must be done when the suckers are very small.<br>
Cutting the tops of the suckers is useless, because they will just grow again.<br>
The whole sucker and its bit of corm must be cut away from the mother plant.<br>
De-suckering must be done each month.<br>
You could say that having lots of suckers is like having too many chickens feeding from one small tin.<br>
4. As the parent plant grows, it will produce several suckers around its base.<br>
 It is important to allow only one of these followers to remain, but two suckers may be left on each parent if the planting is very vigorous.<br>
After the desired follower has been selected, all other sucker growth arising from the parent plant should be removed as soon as possible after it appears.<br>
5. The easiest way to permanently remove unwanted suckers is to cut them off at ground level with a sharp knife.<br>
Cut a small hollow in the centre of the cut surface and pour a teaspoon of kerosene into the cavity to kill the sucker.<br>
Select the follower when the parent is about three quarters grown in the spring or early summer.<br>
6. Cut off the flower bell 100 mm below the last hand to increase fruit size.<br>
Do this once all the banana hands have set fruit.<br>
Leave only the two strongest suckers.<br>
If only one sucker with one banana bunch on the mother tree gives a large bunch.<br>
However, if all the suckers are left, the smaller bunches are easier to handle.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.3H">9.3</a> Mulching<br>
Mulching retains moisture, cuts down on weed growth, and helps the plant absorb the fertilizer better.<br>
Make mulch by chopping the older banana leaves, banana stalks and plants harvested and cut down.<br>
The composted banana leaves and plants will add potassium to the soil.<br>
Use discarded parts of banana plants as long as they do not have pests or diseases attached to them.<br>
Also, use well-rotted manure, straw, lawn clippings.<br>
However, the mulch should be kept at least 50 cm from the base of the plant.<br>
This practice should deter the banana weevil borer from attacking the plants and possibly reduce the incidence of fungal diseases.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.4H">9.4</a> Propping<br>
Propping is to place a prop under the stalk of a hand of fruit, because sometimes the bunch is too heavy for the plant.<br>
Place the prop after the last hand of fruit has formed.<br>
Props can be made from two poles crossed about 50 cm from each end to form an X shape and bound together with wire where they cross.<br>
Then place the shorter upper side of the X under the banana stalk so the bunch to hang down and the stalk is not squeezed.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.5H">9.5</a> Trashing and debelling<br>
Trashing is the cutting down of all dead leaves, because they may have pests and diseases living in them.<br>
Cut them down with a bush knife and burn them.<br>
Cut with an upward stroke of the bush knife.<br>
Removing diseased leaves of bananas while they were still green reduces the spore load and improves air flows that are both good for leaf disease control.<br>
This method also reduces the incidence of other pests.<br>
It is extremely important that dead and diseased leaves are cut from the plant regularly.<br>
Trashing reduces leaf diseases and lowers fire risk, but be careful to remove only leaves that are diseased or completely dead.<br>
Debelling is to cut off the banana flower, the "bell", when the last row of bananas has formed.<br>
This action is done because the flower continues to use some nutrients and the bell makes the bunch much too heavy and may attract birds.<br>
Cut the bell 100 cm from the last hand when the last hand has set.<br>
You can eat the infertile flowers inside the flower petals.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.6H">9.6</a> Weeding<br>
Weeds compete for water, nutrients and light, and may allow pests and diseases to be near the bananas and attack them.<br>
During the first year of growth, until the banana plants are about 2 m tall, chip away weeds and grass between the plants with a hoe.<br>
The ground in the banana project should be weed free, but if the manual weeding is done carelessly with a hoe, the shallow roots of the bananas will be damaged.<br>
Plant a cover crop to control weeds.<br>
You can also use clean mulch to control weeds, but make sure that there are no insect pests in it.<br>
Tiny tissue culture plants have very little reserves, so competition from weeds will weaken the plant.<br>
Use only hand-hoeing to remove weeds.<br>
Avoid all systemic, contact, or hormone weed-killers around the plants.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.7H">9.7</a> Watering<br>
Maintain soil in a moist, but not sodden condition.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.8H">9.8</a> Desuckering<br>
Remove any diseased or down leaves.<br>
The first flush of suckers may appear very early and these should be cut off at ground level, until the mother plant is about 2m tall.<br>
Do not apply kerosene at this young age, as you may damage the mother plant.<br>
Do not be tempted to keep these suckers for your next crop, because they have emerged from a point too shallow under the base of the mother plant.<br>
They may fall over and pull the mother plant over, when mature.<br>
The most suitable sucker for your next crop should be selected 5 months after planting.<br>
At this time, it will have emerged from a point much deeper in the soil and be more stable at maturity.<br>
The suckers you want to select are called sword suckers - very thin sword-like leaves.<br>
Do not select the big fat healthy leafed suckers<br>
These suckers are called water suckers and they will not produce the best plant or the biggest bunch of bananas.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.9H">9.9</a> Bunch Trimming<br>
Remove the bottom couple of hands to increase the overall size and length of the remaining fruit.<br>
These lower hands are noticeably smaller than the ones above, and you can just snap them off with your fingers.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.10H">9.10</a> Bagging<br>
When the fingers start to turn upwards, put a banana bunch cover over the bunch to (hopefully), discourage hungry birds and flying foxes.<br>
Tie the top end of the bag around the bunch stem and leave the bottom end hanging open for air flow to reduce humidity.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.11H">9.11</a> Bell Removal<br>
Some commercial farmers remove the bell, because they believe it drains nutrients from the bunch.<br>
Other farmers leave it on, because they believe the weight helps the bunch to hang straighter.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="9.12H">9.12</a> Abiotic fruit disorders<br>
* Chilling injury: Flecks below the surface of the green skin and pulp of the banana fruit, avoid refrigeration at below 13°C.<br>
* Choke throat of banana occurs when bunch cannot to emerge from the top of the pseudostem leading to badly misshapen fruit.<br>
* Fused fingers is the result of a genetic mutation, as seen in Cavendish varieties.<br>
* Maturity bronzing discoloration of mature green bananas may be caused by water stress.<br>
* Precocious ripening is when individual fingers ripen prematurely, caused by harvesting over-mature bananas, or,<br>
 excessive postharvest storage or transit temperatures, or,<br>
 anthracnose wound infections on fruit skin.<br>
* Sap damage is stains on banana fruit skin, caused by contact of the sensitive green fruit surface with its own banana sap during de-handing and packing activities.<br>
* Senescent spots is a natural part of the ripening process for Cavendish bananas.<br>
They are numerous, superficial brown flecks on peels, caused by forced ripening of overly mature banana fruits.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.0H">10.0</a> Fertilizing<br>
Indicators of nutrient deficiencies:<br> 
Chlorotic streaking of leaves, leaf malformation, dwarfing, reduced leaf length, undulated leaves, small banana bunches, defective flavour of fruit<br>
You will need fertilizers or coconut husks for mulch.<br>
Ask an agriculture extension officer for advice on fertilizing bananas, because suitable application of fertilizers depends on climate, variety and soil type.<br>
1. Bananas are "heavy feeders".<br>
They need a lot of potassium, K.<br>
To get a good size of bunch fertilize early and often.<br>
During the first third of the growth cycle, the size of the bunch is already determined based on the amount of fertilizer, water and heat of the soil.<br>
Bananas need heavy applications of fertilizer near the surface of the soil, because of its shallow roots.<br>
2. For high yield, quick growth during the first 3 months to get the largest possible leaf area is necessary.<br>
However, top dressing with fertilizer after 6 months is not desirable.<br>
Each plant needs about 2 kg of mixed fertilizer each year, but this must be put on a little at a time, not all at once.<br>
The fertilizer must not be put too close to the plant.<br>
It should be spread out evenly in a circle 1 metre wide around the stem of the plant.<br>
Sprinkle 0.25 kg of mixed fertilizer on the ground around each banana plant.<br>
There is no need to dig it in, just sprinkle it over the leaf mulch.<br>
If you do not have any fertilizer, put many coconut husks on the soil around each plant.<br>
Put the husks with the cup upwards.<br>
Husks contain some potash plant food and the rain will wash this wash this into the soil.<br>
At bell emergence, apply a good handful of potash around the tree.<br>
 Put some pig manure around the plants if there is no fertilizer, but the NPK fertilizer is best to use.<br>
Pull out any weeds that are growing near the plants.<br>
3. On sloping sites, apply the fertilizer to the up hill side only.<br>
4. Different fertilizing methods.<br>
In some places, farmers feed the bananas NPK 6-2-12 each week and feed magnesium every two months.<br>
Others use a 5-5-5 all purpose organic fertilizer mixture with additional sources of potassium.<br>
Use a complete fertilizer with an analysis of approximately 10% nitrogen, 2% phosphorus and 22% potassium, that is, a 10:2:22 NPK mixture.<br>
It is quite suitable for use on most of the soils bananas can be grown in.<br>
5. As soon as the sucker begins to grow, or the shoot from the bit appears above ground level, do the first application of fertilizer at the rate of 200 g per plant.<br>
Subsequent dressings of the same fertilizer at twice the rate are applied every 4 to 6 weeks during the growing season.<br>
A similar fertilizing program should be followed in subsequent years over the period of September to April.<br>
Applying a dressing of dolomite at 200 g per square metre every year is beneficial to the plants.<br>
This material should also be spread evenly over the soil.<br>
6. After the first crop is harvested, apply, per banana plant per year,  800 g of agricultural lime 240 g of urea, 30 g of superphosphate, 600 g of potassium sulfate.<br>
For better results, apply a quarter of the recommended application four times between September and April.<br>
Alternatively, apply organic fertilizers.<br>
7. Commercial farmers use Nitrophoska or Rustica, or a NPK blend, grade formula (NPK = 101:3:6).<br>
During warmer growing months apply fertilizer every 4 to 6 weeks, but reduce it during cold months.<br>
Do not to allow the fertilizer to contact the plant stem.<br>
Within two months of planting, roots extend more than a metre away from the stem, so apply the fertilizer thinly over the whole area.<br>
Do NOT apply the fertilizer just around the stem!<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.0H">12.0</a> Fruit bunch<br>
<a href="../images/51.7.1.gif">See diagram 51.7.1</a>: Fruit bunch<br>
<a href="../images/9.100.3.gif">See diagram 9.110.3</a>: Banana berry<br>
 Banana plants start to bear fruit after they have developed a certain number of leaves, 20 to 30 leaves, depending on the variety of banana.<br>
 The fruit bunch appears at the top of the plant when it is about nine to ten months old.<br>
 About 70 days after this the fruits begin to grow, and the bunch starts to get heavier.<br>
 When the bunch begins to develop:<br>
 1. Put a long piece of wood under the stalk of bunch to support it.<br>
 If this is not done, a strong wind may blow the plant down.<br>
 2. Cut off the large bud of the male flowers about 15 to 20 cm below the bottom of the last flower.<br>
 Do this two weeks after the first hand of flowers opens.<br>
 If it is done earlier than this, the plant will lose too much sap.<br>
 If it is done too late, much food will be sent down to this part that is not needed.<br>
 3. Cut off the flower bell 100 mm below the last hand to increase fruit size.<br>
 4. Cut off the two bottom hands to increase fruit size.<br>
 5. Use props to prevent the banana plants from falling over when bearing a heavy bunch.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="13.0H">13.0</a> Harvesting<br>
<a href="../images/51.17.gif">See diagram 51.17</a>: Packing bananas, "hand", "finger"<br>
 1. Fruit develops about two months after the flowering stalk has pushed up.<br>
 The flowering stem has grown up through the middle of the false stem turned down.<br>
 It has started to form two rows of flowers at each node, female flowers and later male flowers.<br>
 The cluster of female flowers at each node will produce a hand of bananas.<br>
 The male flowers are sterile and soon fall off leaving a bare stem.<br>
 The end of the stem continues to grow even after the fruit has formed.<br>
 2. Each cluster of female and male flowers is enclosed in a colourful bracket that is like a protective leaf.<br>
 The young bracts at the end of the stem enclose each other to form a cone, ("the bell").<br>
 The older bracts further up the stem turn back then an off.<br>
 Cut a V through the stem at shoulder height, bend the stem and lower the bunch to the ground.<br>
 Leave 45 cm of the stalk above the fruit.<br>
 This is used for carrying the bunch easily.<br>
 It also holds some water that he fruit can use after cutting.<br>
 Never leave the fruit in the hot sun.<br>
 Always handle fruit very carefully to stop bruising and marking the fruit.<br>
 Never let sea water touch the fruit.<br>
 Bananas ripen best when they are picked green.<br>
 If they are to be used for the home, cutting them down when they are fat
is best, round and light green in colour.<br>
 If they have to be taken in a truck or a boat to market, cutting them down when a little younger and the fruit are still a bit angular and not round is best.<br>
 The fruit ripens best in a dark, cool place, when the banana may have a 20% sugar content and a distinctive aroma caused by | <a href="../topics/topic16b.html#16.5.6">amyl acetate</a> and other esters, | and | <a href="../topics/topic16c.html#16.3.6.9">Eugenol</a> |.<br>
 Take great care should be taken in harvesting bananas.<br>
 3. If the fruit has to be packed into boxes, the hands must be removed and packed neatly in layers in the box, first one way, then the other.<br>
 A little bit of stalk must be left on each hand so that the fingers of each hand stay together.<br>
 4. A bunch is ready to cut when the fruit is fairly evenly rounded with no prominent ribs.<br>
 Also, the dry remains of the flowers break off readily from the fruit tip in the fingers when rubbed.<br>
 If the bunch is protected by an open plastic sleeve, it can be left on the plant until the fruit begin to ripen.<br>
 When harvesting, the stalk of the bunch should be cut well above the top hand of bananas.<br>
 5. A bunch is ready to harvest when the fruit is full and round, the remains of the flowers should break off the end of the fruit when rubbed with the fingers.<br>
 The fingers are plump, green and almost ready to turn yellow.<br>
 Note the date when the first petal opens.<br>
 Twelve weeks later, the fruit should be ready to be cut down.<br>
 Use a bush knife to cut the bunch stalk high up to leave a long "handle".<br>
 If the bunch is too high up, cut partly through the middle of the false stem to make it bend.<br>
 6. Hang up the bunch by the false stem in a shady place for ripening.<br>
 Show the students how to cut down a bunch and hang it in the shade to ripen fully.<br>
 Cut down the tree after harvest.<br>
 The first generation tree will bear fruit once only then die to the ground so after harvesting there is no point in keeping the first generation tree.<br>
 7. Cut the first generation tree down near to ground level and care for the follower crop in the same way as for the first generation crop.<br>
 Show the students a flowering stem with bananas.<br>
 Explain the different parts of the stem and the way the bananas are formed from the female flowers.<br>
 8. Are the bananas ripe?<br>
 Cut open a banana.<br>
 Note the six sided fruit.<br>
 Squeeze the banana and note the three parts of the fruit wall.<br>
 The three rows of black spots are the remains of the seeds.<br>
 9. Harvesting<br>
 Watch the developing fruit for signs of almost-ripeness.<br>
 The corners will round off, and the fruit will fill out.<br>
 Don't leave them on the tree to ripen to yellow, otherwise the whole bunch will ripen all at once.<br>
 Take a finger off the top hand and bring it inside.<br>
 Once it looks ripe enough, taste it.<br>
 If the flavour is good, then vou can remove the whole hand.<br>
 If not, then leave it for another day, and try again.<br>
 If you want to remove the whole bunch.<br>
 Work with another person, because the bunch could weigh as much as 40 kg.<br>
 Cut a notch in the tree at your shoulder height and slowly pull the bunch down onto your shoulder.<br>
 Have someone else cut the bunch stalk from the tree.<br>
 Cut the remaining crown (leaves), off the tree as high as possible and leave these as compost.<br>
 Leave the remaining stem as tall as possible as the retained water and nutrients will continue to feed the suckers.<br>
 When it has completely browned off you can drop it and chop it up and remove it.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="14.0H">14.0</a> Ripening<br>
1. Remove individual hands from a green bunch to be ripened separately to have ripe bananas over a long period.<br>
Leave the hands to ripen in a cool, well ventilated place.<br>
Leave the blue plastic bag cover on the bunch, but open the bottom to provide some extra ventilation.<br>
2. The best ripening temperature is about 20<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
Above 26<sup>o</sup>C, the fruit softens and the pulp will ripens, but the skin remains pale green.<br>
Fruit ripened at day temperatures 25<sup>o</sup>C to 28<sub>o</sub>C and night temperatures 17<sup>o</sup>C to 18<sup>o</sup>C are usually ready 
to eat in 2-5 days.<br>
3. Some people prefer to use fully ripe bananas, but the quality and the flavour of the fruit are no less if harvested at the hard green stage and ripened later.<br>
 The green unripe fruit produces heat and ethylene slowly.<br>
 Then, as the skin colour changes from green to yellow, the fruit starts the ripening phase to quickly produce large amounts of heat and ethylene.<br>
 To ripen bananas using ripening fruit, seal the bunch, hand or fingers in a plastic bag with a ripening red apple or banana to absorb the ethylene from the fruit.<br>
 Leave the bag in a cool dark cupboard, but not in a refrigerator, for one day in summer or four days or more in winter.<br>
 Then remove the ripening fruit, but leave the bananas in the plastic bag.<br>
4. When bananas show the first signs of ripening, remove them from the plastic bag and allow them to ripen normally.<br>
 Do not store bananas below 13<sup>o</sup>C so do not store them in a domestic refrigerator.<br>
 However, bunches of green bananas stored at 13.3<sup>o</sup>C give off little heat or ethylene and so can be stored for about 2 weeks without ripening.<br>
 Below 10<sup>o</sup>C, spoilage occurs when phenolic amines, e.g. dopamine, inside the vacuoles of banana skin cells, leak out.<br>
They react with polyphenol oxidases and air to form brown polyphenols.<br>
 Warming these bananas increases the skin browning.<br>
5. Select a banana with a natural yellow white skin with no black patches.<br>
 Put the banana in the refrigerator freezer overnight.<br>
 The next day observe the banana still in the freezer.<br>
 It is frozen hard and the same colour as the night before.<br>
 The oxidase enzymes cannot function at such a low temperature.<br>
 Cover a plate with water to make a 0.5 cm layer of water over the plate.<br>
 Remove the banana from the freezer and place it on the plate.<br>
 The banana skin darkens before your eyes and if you feel the banana it is soft inside.<br>
 Pick up the banana a and observe its underside.<br>
 It still has the same colour as the night before, because the water on the plate did not allow oxygen to have access to the browning reaction.<br>
 Put the banana on the table.<br>
 The whole banana becomes black and squashy.<br>
 When harvested when the fruit is mature, but still green, the banana is mostly starch and about 1% sugar.<br>
 Tannins in the pulp of the unripe banana give it an astringent taste.<br>
 Browning enzymes and phenolic substances in its vascular system cause the pulp of an unpeeled banana to brown easily.<br>
 As bananas ripen, the starch converts almost entirely to sugar until when ripe they are nearly 20% sugar.<br>
 Ripe bananas have a smooth consistency and a characteristic smell caused by amyl acetate and other esters, and, eugenol.<br>
 The acidity increases during ripening when they have a dry, starchy texture.<br>
 Once a fruit is ripe, it can be placed in a refrigerator with little discoloration, although the peel will still turn black.<br>
 Very ripe bananas are easily digested, which helps sick people and they are an excellent weaning food for babies when they stop drinking their mother's milk.<br>
 Plantains (cooking bananas), have a high concentration of starch, so they must be cooked.<br>
6. Prevent bananas from ripening too quickly by keeping them wrapped in a double sheet of newspaper in a cool cupboard.<br>
 In very hot weather keep bananas wrapped in aluminium foil in a refrigerator to extend their shelf life.<br>
 If not to be eaten immediately, choose bananas with green tips.<br>
 Solid yellow bananas are almost ready to eat and bananas with brown specks on the skin should be eaten immediately.<br>
 Keep bananas at room temperature away from direct sunlight.<br>
 The skin will turn brown black caused by browning enzymes and phenolic substances, but the flesh will be unaffected.<br>
 The ideal refrigeration temperature is about 13<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 If stored below 10<sup>o</sup>C, spoilage increases, because of increase phenol levels from breakdown of cell membranes.<br>
7. To assist ripening of green bananas put them in a paper bag with an apple or pear.<br>
 If using fresh bananas in fruit salads squeeze lemon juice over them to prevent browning.<br>
 Use very ripe bananas in muffins or cakes.<br>
 If using bananas in sandwiches or fruit salads, drop them in boiling water for a few seconds before peeling.<br>
Then they will not turn black when used, but will keep their original colour.<br>
8. Use the trickle system to disperse ethylene, because of the potential for explosions if the concentration of gas in the room gets too high.<br>
A cheaper way for the small grower is to use ‘Ripe Gas, which is mostly carbon dioxide.<br>
Higher respiratory bananas like Lady Fingers or Gold Fingers don’t need much initiating.<br>
The variett Goldfingers can ripen too fast in summer with gas introduced and often are best ripened only with their own ethylene.<br>
The critical thing is when the colour change starts, heat is produced and if this is not removed the shelf life is less.<br>
Bananas are ripened in cold rooms at about 15°C.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="15.0H">15.0</a> Diet<br>
 1. Bananas are a good source of dietary fibre, Vitamin C, vitamin A and potassium.<br>
 A banana may contain more potassium, calcium, phosphorus, iron, Vitamin A, thiamine, riboflavin, Niacin, and ascorbic acid than an apple!<br>
 2. Bananas with a high sugar content are usually eaten raw.<br>
 Bananas with high starch content (plantains), are usually cooked.<br>
 Banana leaves can be used for wrapping fish, meat or chicken to be steamed, poached, grilled or barbecued.<br>
The stems and leaves can be used for plates, wrapping, umbrellas and cattle feed.<br>
 The fibres can be used to make a batik cloth.<br>
 The banana blossom (banana inflorescence), can be eaten after peeling off the outer leaves.<br>
 It can be cooked in curries or soups.<br>
 The male banana flower can be boiled and eaten as a vegetable.<br>
 However, depending on the variety, the flower may have too high oxalic content and so are too astringent for most people.<br>
 4. Simple Banana Bread<br>
 Cream together in a bowl 113 g softened, but ter, 1 cup sugar or coconut sugar, 3 eggs.<br>
 Add 3 very ripe large mashed bananas.<br>
 Sift together the following dry ingredient: 2 cups flour, 1 tsp. baking soda, 1/2 tsp. baking powder, 1.2 tsp. salt.<br>
 Then add to the creamed mixture alternately with 3 tsp., buttermilk and 1/2 tsp. vanilla.<br>
 Stir until just combined.<br>
 Fold in the 1/2 cup chopped pecan nuts.<br>
 Pour into greased and parchment lined loaf pan.<br>
 Bake at 180<sup>o</sup>C in preheated oven for 50-60 minutes, until a skewer comes out clean when tested.<br>
 Cool in pan briefly then turn out onto a rack to cool completely.<br>
 Keeps well if refrigerated.<br>
 5. Use central core of the banana bell, the tender immature flowers and bracts for salads and as a cooked vegetable.<br>
 6. Banana flower salad<br>
 Use flower or bells only from a chemical-free source.<br>
 Discard the tough outer leaves from a banana flower, then finely shred the rest.<br>
 Keep the outer shells for serving.<br>
 Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a wok or frypan over high heat.<br>
 Add 1 onion, seeded and chopped red chilli, 2 cloves, crushed garlic, 1 tablespoon shredded ginger.<br>
 Cook for 3 minutes or until golden.<br>
 Add shredded banana flower and cook for 8 - 10 minutes or until banana flower is tender.<br>
 When shredding the flower keep in lemon juice and water to stop it browning till you have finished shredding when ready dry on a paper towel.<br>
 Add 500 g lean rump steak, or chicken breast, or prawns or fish and cook for 5 minutes or until sealed.<br>
 Add 2 tablespoons lime juice and 2 tablespoons of soy sauce and cook for 2 minutes.<br>
 Toss through 3 tablespoons mint and 3 tablespoons coriander and serve.<br>
