<a href="../images/62.1.1.gif">See diagram 62.1.1</a>: Four kinds of taro<br>
Taro is an important food plant in many Pacific islands like Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, and the Cook Islands.<br>
It is also eaten by many people in the Solomon Islands and New Hebrides.<br>
The different kinds of taro plants are in the family Araceae.<br>
The aroids are large herbs usually with tubers.<br>
They mainly grow in damp places in the tropics.<br>
Taro plants are usually pollinated by flies.<br>
The corms are roasted or boiled and the starch in them can be made into flour.<br>
Some kinds of taro plants contain calcium oxalate crystals, that must be removed during cooking that denatures any offensive enzymes and 
dissolves the calcium oxalate crystals.<br>
Taro usually grows in damp soils and can grow in soil that is waterlogged for a time, if the water is moving.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">The four main kinds of taro plants are as follows:<br>
Family Araceae, Arum family, aroids, usually have a spadix inflorescence inside spathe and may contain raphides.<br>
 <a name="TaroH"></a>Taro, common taro, "taro tru", wild taro, dasheen, eddo, Chinese eddoe, old cocoyam (<i>Colocasia esculenta</i>)<br>
The plant is a staple food in many tropical countries and very popular in the Pacific islands.<br>
It is 1-2 m tall with underground corms about 30 cm long.<br>
It seldom forms flowers or seeds.<br>
Herbaceous plant having central corm, with attached cormels, roots and shoots<br>
It has large flat leaves on the end of upright leaf stalks.<br>
The leaf stalk or petiole joins the leaf towards the centre of the leaf, unlike other edible aroids<br>
Near the ground a thickened rounded corm is produced.<br>
Around this plant is a ring of small plants called suckers.<br>
Many different varieties occur, chromosome number, 2n = 22 to 42, 
from taro in different locations<br>
Taro grows from sea level up to high altitudes.<br>
It grows well in humid places.<br>
It can grow in damp soil and under light shade.<br>
It is ready to eat in one year.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="GiantswamptaroH"></a>Giant swamp taro, (Cyrtosperma merkusii), swamp taro, babai, western pacific region, Southeast Asia, Family Araceae.<br>
Swamp taro in Papua New Guinea, babai in Kiribati, via kan in Fiji, pulaka in Tuvalu, palawan in Philippines, mane in Nepal<br>
Important source of carbohydrates in harsh atoll environments.<br>
It grows to 4 m in height with large leaves that stand straight up.<br>
The lower lobes of the leaves are almost as long as the upper lobe.<br>
This plant grows very slowly and it only grows in swampy land.<br>
This is the main kind of taro grown by the atoll people in Kiribati, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Caroline Islands.<br>
Starchy corm must be cooked for a long time to reduce toxicity, but are rich in nutrients<br>
They may weave baskets around the growing tubers and add chopped leaves to the baskets to act as mulch.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="TanniataroH"></a>Tannia</a>, (<i>Xanthosoma sagittifolium</i>), Chinese taro, arrowleaf elephant ear, kong kong taro, yautia, "new cocoyam", tana, taro tarua, taro futuna, daloni, "kong kong taro", Family Araceae<br>
(<i>Xanthosoma</i> atrovirens, X. vioaceum, X. caracu are of lesser importance.)<br>
Tropical America, yam-like tuber, arrowhead-shaped leaves.<br>
Chinese taro grows to 2 m height and has a corm at the base with about 10 lateral tubers or cormlets (cormels),.<br>
It is common in the Cook islands and Tonga and less common in other islands.<br>
In Fiji, it is called dalo ni tana and in the Cook Islands, it is called taro tarua.<br>
Instead of making one big root or corm, it makes many small cormlets.<br>
The leaf is quite different in shape from ordinary taro and the leaf stalk is joined to the edge of the leaf, not to the underside of the leaf.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="GianttaroH"></a>Giant taro, wild taro, kape, elephant's ear taro (<i>Alocasia macrorrhizos</i>), Family Araceae.<br>
(<i>Alocasia</i> indica, A. fornicata, A. cucullata are of lesser importance.)<br>
Also, <i>Alocasia brisbanensis</i>, cunjevoi, wild taro, wild food plant, Australia, Araceae<br>
Giant taro has the largest leaves known and is poisonous.<br>
It is not usually planted, but grows wild in the volcanic islands.<br>
It is a large erect herb 3-4 m tall with a stout permanent stem.<br>
It was cultivated in eastern Asia.<br>
In Fiji it is called via kau.<br>
The food part grows above the ground.<br>
The split between the upper lobes of the leaf goes right down to the junction with the petiole or leaf stalk.<br>
It is not popular, because the food part contains calcium oxalate crystals, which must be removed during cooking.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="ElephantyamH"></a>Elephant yam, <i>Amorphophallus paeonifolius</i>, telingo potato, Family Araceae.<br>
(Also, Amorphophallus oncophyllus, A. varialbis, A. rivierai are edible.)<br>


<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="2.0H">2.0</a> Taro planting material<br>
<a href="../images/62.2.gif">See diagram 62.2: </a> Planting material<br>
<a href="../images/62.2.1.gif">See diagram 62.2.1</a>: Planting suckers, taro tops<br>
Show examples of the different kinds of planting material in the classroom.<br>
Taro can be planted from three kinds of planting material:<br>
1. "Tops" are the leaf stalks with a little of the top of the taro root.<br>
This is the most common planting material.<br>
Bigger tops are better than smaller tops, because they have more stored food and usually produce a bigger taro.<br>
The best tops are 6-7 cm wide at the base.<br>
2. "Suckers" grow from the sides of the taro root or corm.<br>
They are good planting material.<br>
Use the biggest suckers, because they have more stored food.<br>
A taro grown from suckers has a pointed base, but a taro grown from tops has a flat base.<br>
3. "Runners" grow out from the corms and run over the surface of the ground.<br>
These runners make shoots that can be used to plant the taro.<br>


<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.0H">3.0</a> Making a taro garden<br>
Chose a place for the taro garden.<br>
It should be a flat place, about 8 × 8 metres, near running water and where the soil is damp.<br>
Dig the garden area twice with two weeks between diggings.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="4.0H">4.0</a> Planting taro<br>
<a href="../images/62.4.gif">See diagram 62.4: </a> Planting taro<br>
Taro is propagated vegetatively, by the leaf-bearing tops of mature corms or by small side shoots or suckers. <br>
For an 8 × 8 m garden you will need about 200 pieces of planting material, tops or suckers.<br>
Plant the tops 60 cm apart and about 30 cm deep.<br>
In some places the people plant the taro with a digging stick.<br>
After making a hole they plant the taro top, but they do not cover the hole, they leave it open.<br>
Some people say this is not a good idea and the hole should be filled in after planting the taro.<br>

<a href="../images/62.6.gif">See diagram 62.6: </a> Taro leaf<br>
<a href="../images/62.6.1.gif">See diagram 62.6.1</a>: Different swamp taros<br>
The shoot is mainly leaves which develop in a whorl from the apex of the corm.<br>
The taro leaf has a large flat lamina, and a long tapering leaf stalk or petiole.<br>
The midrib runs from the petiole to the leaf tip.<br>
It is seen mostly on the underside of the leaf.<br>
Two smaller midribs support the upper lobes of the leaf.<br>
In some taro varieties there is a dark spot on the topside where the petiole joins the leaf.<br>
Side veins run from the midrib to the edge of the leaf.<br>
Very small veins pass from the side veins into the lamina of the leaf.<br>
In some varieties, dark marks may be seen on the leaf, especially near the midribs of the upper lobes.<br>
Because the lower tip of the leaf is pointed, it is a "drip tip".<br>
This means that water that has washed over the leaf may stop here, before dropping off the leaf.<br>
This water may bring to the tip some oxalic acid that is in the leaf.<br>
That is why if people are going to eat the leaf, they first pull off the tip that contains more acid.<br>
The leaves can be harvested all year round.<br> 
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">The leaf stalk or petiole has three main parts:<br>
* Broad lower base part,<br>
* Middle part,<br>
* Upper end that joins the leaf and is usually bent over.<br>
The colour of the petiole is important, for this is the chief way of telling one taro variety from another.<br>
The colour may be pale green, green, dark green, purple or red.<br>
It may have red, brown or dark green streaks on it.<br>
The colour of the base may be green, white or red.<br>
The top may have a different colour on its upper side or underside.<br>
Cut across the tops of a taro plant.<br>
The petioles are all in different positions so that each leaf will be held out to the light in a different position and will not shade the leaf next to it.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="7.0H">7.0</a> Taro corm, <i>Colocasia species</i><br>
<a href="../images/62.7.gif">See diagram 62.7: </a> Taro corm<br>
<a href="../images/62.7.1.gif">See diagram 62.7.1</a>: Corm with many suckers, cormlets<br>
Show taro corms in the classroom.<br>
The part of the taro you eat is called a corm.<br>
It is really an underground stem swollen with stored starch.<br>
It contains protein, calcium, phosphorus, iron, potassium and vitamins A, B, and C.<br> 
Like other stems it has these parts:<br>
1. The growing point or a shoot apex.<br>
To see the growing point, use a knife to cut down through the leaf stalks and the corm.<br>
2. The shoot apex is a rounded part that goes up into the base of the leaf stalks.<br>
Another way to see it, is to pull off the leaf bases of the petioles until the rounded dome of the shoot apex can be seen.<br>
Many leaves joined to the shoot apex.<br>
As the corm grows the older leaves die and drop off and new leaves are made.<br>
3. A leaf scar is a place where a leaf was joined to the corm, but has now fallen off.<br>
The leaf scars are seen as circular marks that go around the corm.<br>
Terminal bud is close to the apex, so plant height is height of leavers, up to 2 m.<br>
The leaf has large erect petiole, containing air spaces, attached to the middle of a large lamina, unlike other edible aroids.<br>
Three main veins from attachment of petiole and lateral veins.<br>
Base of petiole clasps around apex of corm.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Axillary buds form just above the place where the leaf was joined to the stem.<br>
The axillary buds can grow into little corms or "cormlets" (cormels),.<br>
The cormlets can grow into suckers that may be used as planting material.<br>
The shape of the bottom of the corm tells us what kind of planting material was used.<br>
If it were grown from tops, the base of the corm will be flat.<br>
If it were grown from a sucker, the base of the corm will be pointed.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="8.0H">8.0</a> Taro roots<br>

Show taro roots in the classroom.<br>
The easiest way to see taro roots is to plant a top and then dig it up after a week.<br>
See a ring of white roots growing from the base of the top.<br>
As the corm grows upwards, most of the roots are usually up near the top of the corm.<br>
When the taro is nearly ready to harvest there may not be very many roots left on it.<br>

<a href="../images/62.9.1.gif">See diagram 62.9.1</a>: Flowers of swamp taro<br>
Show an unopened and an opened flower head in the classroom.<br>
Taro flowers are seldom seen, but they are interesting.<br>
When the taro plant has grown to full size, it may make a head of flowers.<br>
This is not important, because it does not usually make seeds and they cannot be used for planting.<br>
When the flower head first appears, it is enclosed by a large leaf-like wrapping called a spathe.<br>
Later the spathe will open and then the small flowers will be seen growing on a central stalk.<br>
The female flowers are form lower and the small male flowers are formed further up the stalk.<br>
At the end there is usually a small piece of stalk that has no flowers on it.<br>
Flowers may have bad smell to attract flies that pollinate them.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.0H">10.0</a> Life cycle of a taro plant<br>
<a href="../images/62.10.gif">See diagram 62.10: </a> Life cycle of taro<br>
Show examples of the different phases in the classroom.<br>
As a taro plant grows, it passes through three different phases:<br>
1. Establishment phase<br>
During this phase the plant is making its first roots and forming its first leaves.<br>
At first the leaves are rolled up into a tube, but later they unfold as the fast growing petiole carries them upwards.<br>
During this phase it is important that the soil is kept moist.<br>
This is why the people in the Cook Islands cover the surface of the soil with dead coconut or other leaves to act as a mulch.<br>
The establishment phase lasts about eight weeks.<br>
During this phase the corm does not grow much.<br>
2. Vegetative or leaf-making phase<br>
This phase starts when the taro is about eight weeks old, and it lasts for about three months or when the plant is 20-24 weeks old.<br>
The plant must have many leaves to make much starch for the corm, so during this phase: the number of leaves increases,<br>
The height of the leaves increase also so the plant gets higher, the corm starts to grow upwards, but at first it only grows slowly.<br>
3. Maturity phase or storage phase<br>
This phase occurs when the taro plant has grown to its greatest height.<br>
This phase usually lasts from 20 to 40 weeks.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">During this maturity phase:<br>
* The height of the leaves gets lower,<br>
* The number of leaves grows less,<br>
* The corm grows bigger quickly.<br>
At this time, all the starch made by the leaves moves down to the corm where it is stored.<br>
At this time also, fewer roots form so there may be very few roots on the taro when it is harvested.<br>
At what phase are the taro plants in the school garden, in the village gardens?<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="11.0H">11.0</a> Varieties of taro<br>
<a href="../images/62.11.gif">See diagram 62.11: </a> Varieties of taro<br>
Show different varieties of taro in the classroom or visit village gardens to see varieties of taro.<br>
In some places there are only one or two varieties of taro, because disease has killed off most of the other varieties.<br>
Yet in places where taro plants grow well, there are many varieties, e.g. about 70 varieties in Fiji.<br>
What are the differences there are between local varieties of taro?<br>
What are the names of the local varieties and how to recognize them? 
1. Taro varieties may differ in many ways, as follows:<br>
* The petiole may be red, purple, green or streaked.<br>
* The streaks on the petiole may be dark green, or brown, or purple
or white and red.<br>
* The top of the petiole may be a different colour from the middle of
 the petiole, or it may have a special colour on top or underneath.<br>
* The base of the petiole may be paler, or white or pink.<br>
* The corms may be single or they may be branching.<br>
* The middle of the leaf may have a purple spot where the petiole joins it.<br>
* The top of the leaf lamina may have a dark coloured streaks.<br>
* The size of the corms and the yield may vary.<br>
2. The amount of water in the corms may vary.<br>
Some corms have much water and are called "soft" taro.<br>
Some corms have less water and are called "hard" taro.<br>
3. The colour of the corms may be white, grey, yellowish, purple, or pink.<br>
4. The length of time for growth to maturity may vary.<br>
Some taro varieties are ready to harvest in six or seven months.<br>
They are called "quick maturing" taro.<br>
Some varieties take eight months before they are ready for harvest.<br>
They are called "medium maturing" taro.<br>
Some varieties take nine or twelve months before they are ready for harvest.<br>
They and are called "late maturing" taro.<br>
5. Some varieties make many suckers, but others make very few suckers.<br>
Some varieties make runners that grow over the surface of the ground, but others never do this.<br>
6. Some varieties need a very wet place to grow, but others can be grown on drier land.<br>
7. Some varieties easily get infected with diseases, but others never get these diseases.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="11a.0H">11a.0</a> Commercial varieties of taro<br>
1. Variety "Taro Pacific"<br>
<a href="../images/Taropacific.jpg">See diagram</a>: "Taro Pacific"<br>
Staple crop in the Pacific region, prefers moist soil, up to 3-4 kg, used like potato, ornamental heart-shaped leaves, grows in sun and part-shade.<br>
 2. Variety "Taro Japanese"<br>
<a href="../images/Tarojapanese.jpg">See diagram</a>: Variety "Taro Japanese"<br>
Staple crop throughout Asia and the Pacific region, prefers moist soi, small tubers used like potato, attractive heart-shaped, grows in sun and part shade<br>. 
3. Variety "Tahitian spinach"<br>
This variety developed for its edible leaves and stems to be cooked as a green vegetable, but should never be eaten raw.<br>
Stems are widely used as a celery substitute providing protein, calcium, phosphorus, iron, potassium and vitamins A and B.<br>
The leaves can be harvested all year round, but produces small bulbils which can spread rapidly as a weed.<br>
4. Variety "Black Magic"<br>
<a href="../images/Taroblack.jpg">See diagram</a>: Variety "Black Magic"<br>
Called "Elephant Ears", because shape of leaves, dark red-purple stems, pond edge plant for ponds can be submerged to 15 cm depth, but best grown in pots.<br>
Grow them in moist, partially shaded places, or full sun if plenty of water.<br>
They are an attractive house plant, but do not allow to spread into waterways.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="12.0H">12.0</a> History of the taro plant 
- <i>Colocasia species</i><br>
Taro plants probably came from Southeast Asia where it still occurs wild.<br>
From there it was taken to China or Japan.<br>
At the time of Christ, taro plants were was reported growing in Egypt, where they are still grown.<br>
From Egypt it spread to Mediterranean countries and to Africa, especially to the forest areas of West Africa and the West Indies.<br>
About 2000 years ago when taro plants were being taken west to Africa, it was also taken eastward to the Pacific islands.<br>
From the Central Pacific taro spread to Tahiti and from there to New Zealand, Hawaii and the West Indies.<br>
Taro plants have different names in different parts of the world that reflects the history of taro.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="13.0H">13. 0</a> Care of the taro plant<br>
The energy needed to make the food in the taro root comes from the sunlight.<br>
When the leaf uses this sunlight energy and turns it into stored food energy, some energy is always lost.<br>
Energy is lost in different ways:<br>
The soil does not have the required plant foods or there is not enough water in the soil.<br>
The taro plants are infected with a disease or insect pests eat the leaves.<br>
The taro plant is not the best variety for that place.<br>
Ask an agriculture extension officer to advise on the best varieties to grow.<br>
The taro plants are not given good care and are not weeded properly.<br>
How can you make taro plants grow better by controlling the energy losses?<br>
After controlling energy losses you can make taro plants grow better by adding plant food to the soil.<br>
Plant foods can be put into the soil in three ways:<br>
Put fertilizers in the soil.<br>
Ask an agriculture extension officer to recommend a suitable fertilizer for taro.<br>
Taro plants need potash fertilizer<br>
In some places taro is fertilized with a 6: 9: 8 mixture of ammonium sulfate, superphosphate and potassium sulfate.<br>
Do not use too much fertilizer and do not put it too closer than 10 cm to the plants.<br>
One matchbox full for every square metre of soil may be enough.<br>
Make compost and put it on the soil near the taro plants.<br>
The best kind of compost includes animal manure.<br>
Ask an agriculture extension officer to advise on the use of compost.<br>
In some places, mulching taro is NOT recommended, because the mulch may contain the larvae of the taro beetle.<br>
Green manure.<br>
Dig into the taro garden some legume plants, e.g. siratro, desmodium, cowpea.<br>
The rotting legumes will add nitrogen to the soil.<br>

Other names: Taro Blight, Leaf Blight, Phytophthora Leaf Blight, Yu Yi Ping (China)<br>
The Taro Leaf Blight fungus produces small round watery spots that get bigger.<br>
Later these rotten areas may get larger, especially near the tip of the leaf.<br>
During the day the spots dry and contain a white powder.<br>
The taro plant produces a clear liquid at the leaf tips from a structure, called a hydathode.<br>
Producing liquid from leaves is called guttation.<br>
The liquid dries to form brown pellets where the spores of the Taro Leaf Blight can survive dry conditions.<br>
Taro Leaf Blight may be spread by runoff water along the path of drainage.<br>
Planting material may be infected and become the source of the disease.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Control of Taro Leaf Blight<br>
1. Use only healthy planting material.<br>
Do not use planting material infected with the disease from the previous year.<br>
If the disease occurs, observe how it spreads then think of ways to control it, e.g. change to surface drainage may control further spread of then disease.<br>
Plant the taro plants further apart so the disease cannot move so easily from one plant to another.<br>
Spray the plants with Bordeaux Mixture.<br>
It is a mixture of copper (II), sulfate and calcium hydroxide or slaked lime (calcium hydroxide).<br>
2. Viruses cause diseases that may make light and dark streaks on taro leaves, or may make the leaves die.<br>
The only way to stop these diseases is to dig out diseased plants and burn them.<br>
Then the disease cannot spread to other plants.<br>

Taro Beetle, Babai Beetle (<i>Papuana huebneri</i> and <i>Papuana uninodis</i>), Classification: Coleoptera, Scarabaeidae<br>
The adult beetles of <i>Papuana huebneri</i> are serious pests of taro and other plants, e.g. Chinese taro <i>Xanthosoma sagittifolium</i>, oil palm, young coconuts, bananas, sweet potato,<br>pit pit and a fern Angiopteris.<br>
The adults can make the plants wilt and die.<br>
They enter the stalks and bore down into the corms, making 10 mm diameter tunnels.<br>
They give a sour taste to the corm.<br>
In the Solomon Islands, <i>Papuana uninodis</i> adults burrows into the corm below ground level base.<br>
The larvae may live in the coconut roots, but may not cause damage.<br>
The adult female lays eggs deep in the soil.<br>
The larvae hatch as white curl grubs.<br>
They eat rotting vegetation, so they can live in mulch, cow dung and garbage tips.<br>
They form a pupa in the soil.<br>
The adult emerges about 20 weeks after the egg was laid and lays eggs after about 7 weeks.<br>
The adults move about at night and live for up to one year.<br>
No insecticide can control this pest.<br>

Taro corms do not store well, keep for about two weeks at room temperature, but if into plastic bags, or refrigerated, they may keep longer.<br>
Some varieties have less water and more starch food.<br>
It contains much starch, so is a very good energy food.<br>
It contains almost no fat and little protein.<br>
There is not much fibre, so the food is easily digested.<br>

When the taro plants are ready for harvest, they can be dug up a little at a time or all dug up and sold in a market.<br>
Dig up the taro plants, then cut off the leaf stalks about 90 cm in length.<br>
Sell the taro crop in the market.<br>
Record the following information:<br>
Total weight of the taro crop harvested and total weight sold<br>
Costs of growing the taro crop<br>
Separate costs into:<br>
* Production costs, which would have to be paid again next year, and<br>
* Establishment costs, which would not have to be paid again for, say, five years.<br>
Divide the establishment costs by 5 and add this the production costs to be the total cost.<br>
Total receipts from selling the taro crop (Profit = total receipts from selling the taro crop - production costs - establishment costs/5),.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="18.0H">18.0</a> Growing taro for profit<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="20.0H">20.0</a> Developing salt-tolerant varieties of taro<br>
Taro, in the Pacific Islands, is under threat from rising sea levels, but wild Australian plants being cultivated by The University of Queensland may help boost food
security in the region.<br>
The genetics of wild relatives of taro may hold the key to developing salt tolerant varieties.<br>
Tidal inundations caused by rising sea levels, increased cyclone activity and contaminated groundwater can cause toxic levels of salt to affect taro production.<br>
A team is looking at the physiological mechanisms and underlying genetics of native and naturalised Australian wild taro that grow in tidal habitats.<br>
It is developing a high-throughput, low cost system at UQ to screen taro plants for salinity tolerance.<br>
It is are using specialised pots to expose taro plants to elevated salinity through simulated tidal inundation to get a DNA ‘fingerprint’ of each plant’s unique genetic sequence.<br>
The entire collection of more than 2000 taro samples held in the SPC Genetic Resource Centre in Fiji will also be DNA fingerprinted.<br>
It is cataloguing DNA markers that breeders can use to rapidly transfer stress tolerance genetics into cultivated taro varieties.<br>
The importance of identifying the genetic diversity of taro was highlighted in the 1990s when an outbreak of taro leaf blight wiped out Samoa’s taro industry.<br>
The threat to other Pacific Islands drove home the need for a gene bank of highly diverse taro material that included disease resistance genes.<br>
New breeding technologies can be used to develop taro better suited to a changing climate.<br>
<br>
Dr Bradley Campbell, based at the Centre for Crop Science at Queensland Alliance for Agriculture and Food Innovation, University of Queensland, (QAAFI, UQ) reports that a leading threat to the Pacific region is the risk of rising sea levels and increased cyclone activity due to climate change.<br>
Toxic levels of salt can impact the cultivation of major food crops such as taro (Colocasia spp.).<br>
Wild relatives of taro are native or naturalised to Australia and are often found growing in areas with regular tidal intrusion, suggesting these species may have adapted to salinity.<br>
We will identify and conserve taro wild relatives growing in saline habitats in and around South-East Queensland.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="21.0H">21.0</a> Cooking taro<br>
There are many ways to cook taro to avoid the ill effects of the sharp calcium oxalate raphides in raw taro.<br>
Do not eat the leaves or stem.<br>
Slice the tubers and cook thoroughly by boiling with baking soda, steaming or braising, and serve with milk, yoghurt or coconut milk.<br>
Some people are allergic to it, so do not eat too much at first try and do not feed it to babies or young children.<br>
Most Chinese restaurants serve taro dumplings, so taste to see if you are allergic to taro.<br>
(Taro - Chinese: yu to)<br>
Some varieties become purple during cooking caused by phenolic compounds, but these compounds are not harmful.<br>
Taro keeps its shape during cooking and becomes waxy when cooled.<br>
Freshly-cooked taro has an "egg yolk" smell.<br>
Poi is a Hawaiian food made by mashing cooked taro corms in water.<br>
Recipe 1.<br>
Taro leaves with coconut cream<br>
24 taro leaves (three per parcel), 3 cups coconut cream, 1 cup water, 2 medium thinly sliced onions, 1 tsp. salt, pepper to taste, 8 aluminium foil sheets (30 × 24 cm)<br>
Prepare the taro leaves before cooking, as follows:<br>
* Pick young leaves, rinse well and shake off excess water<br>
* For each leaf, remove the tip, all of the stalk and 1 cm of the leaf around the stalk.<br>
Remove all these parts, because they contain substances that may cause uncomfortable itching in the mouth and throat.<br>
Recipe 2.<br>
Baked taro leaves in parcels<br>
* Mix the coconut cream, water, salt and pepper<br>
* Put one foil sheet on a small bowl.<br>Arrange three taro leaves on top of the foil.<br>
Gently push down the centre of the foil to form a hollow, without splitting the taro leaves.<br>
Put some coconut cream, water, onion, salt and pepper mixture into the hollow.<br>
Collect the ends of the taro leaves into the centre to form a round parcel.<br>
Collect the ends of the foil together in the same way, and twist the ends of the foil together in the centre.<br>
Put the parcels in a roasting dish and bake for one hour.<br>
Recipe 3.<br>
Boiled taro leaves<br>
* Cut the taro leaves and put them in a saucepan of boiling water to cook for 10 minutes then drain off the water<br>
* Combine the coconut cream, water, onions, salt and pepper, and add this mixture to the taro leaves.<br>
* Heat the mixture and taro leaves until they boil and simmer for 
a further 10, or until the taro leaves are tender to the taste.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2">Taro<br>
It is grown all over Africa.<br>
Taro never has an aerial stem as is the case with some varieties of tania.<br>
Taro leaves are a lighter green and less shiny than those of tania.<br>
They are smaller.<br>
The leaf blade is thin and flexible.<br>
The leaf-stalk is thin, flexible and has no sheath.<br>
The leaf-stalk is not a continuation of the midrib, as with tania.<br>
The taro leaf- stalk is not attached to the edge of the leaf, but near  the centre of the leaf blade.<br>
The underground stem varies a lot.<br>
It may be round or flat, branching or not branching.<br>
 the underground stems of taro often produce secondary tubers, but they  are smaller.<br>
Unlike what happens with tania, it is chiefly the bigger, central tuber that is used for food.<br>
It remains tender when ripe, at harvest time.<br>
There are many varieties of taro, as there are of tania.<br>
The tubers may be large or small, with flesh that is yellow, red or white,  hard or soft, that becomes floury after cooking, or doughy.<br>
Taro are usually propagated from small tubers or pieces of tuber.<br>
Sometimes the suckers, or new shoots that appear some distance from the  parent plant, are used.<br>
With tania, pieces of the aerial stem can sometimes be used, or the main  tuber if it has become too hard to eat.<br>
The tubers, pieces of tuber or of aerial stem are cut into pieces 10 to 15 cm long.<br>
The leaf- stalks are cut at about 10 cm from the junction with  the leaf.<br>
Taro may be planted by themselves or they may be planted with other crops in the same field.<br>
For example, they can be grown in the shade of a plantation of plantains.<br>
They can also be grown under the dense foliage of big forest trees.<br>
Because tania and taro have large leaves, they may be used as a cover crop when starting a new cocoa plantation.<br>
Planting is done at the beginning of the rainy season in rather shallow  holes.<br>
When grown alone, the distance between the holes may be 60 cm  in all directions, or else 60 cm by 80 cm.<br>
When grown with other crops, for example, when tania and taro are used  to shade young cocoa trees,<br>
 the distance between the holes varies between 50 cm and 1 metre.<br>
Taro require very little care.<br>
One or two cultivations in the early stages of growth are all that is necessary before the harvest.<br>
Often the plants are lightly earthed up when these cultivations are carried  out.<br>
Harvesting.<br>
Depending on variety, taro are between 6 and 14 months in the field.<br>
The tubers are ripe and ready for harvest when the leaves turn yellow and the plant begins to wither.<br>
The fully ripe tubers should be harvested in dry weather.<br>
If you harvest during the dry season, the tubers may be left in the earth  for some time and will not spoil.<br>
When the field is wet, the ripe tubers must be harvested quickly.<br>
They may sprout and will then be no good for human food.<br>
Each tania or taro plant may yield several harvests during one crop period.<br>
As a rule, the harvests should be organized as follows:<br>
The first harvest begins 6 to 8 months after planting.<br>
After that, harvest again two or three times from the same plant at intervals  of 2 or 3 weeks.<br>
When harvesting dig out the soil right up to the plant, take the biggest  tubers and detach them from the parent plant.<br>
Then fill in the hole.<br>
Let the young tubers develop before harvesting again.<br>
The harvested tubers are cleaned and can be sold fresh.<br>
But tania and taro tubers may be kept for some time, and eaten as and when needed.<br>
To keep the tubers for some months after harvesting, you must prevent them from rotting.<br>
To do that, put the tubers on dry ground, or on boards supported on posts,  in a well- aired, dry, cool place, sheltered from sun and rain.<br>
