<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.10.1H">10.10.1</a> Reduce copper oxide with natural gas, methane<br>
 1. Pass natural gas, about 95% methane, over heated copper (II) oxide powder.<br>
 The reduction reaction is slow and may need twenty minutes of strong heating.<br>
 The copper does not glow with heating so it is not clear when all the copper oxide has been reduced.<br>
 4CuO (s) + CH4 (g) --> 4Cu (s) + 2H2O (l) + CO2 (g)<br>
 2. Repeat the experiment with a 1 cm cubic piece of metaldehyde in the reduction tube.<br>
 The reduction is quicker.<br>
 3. Repeat the experiment with natural gas that has bubbled through ethanol.<br>
 The reduction is quicker and a slight glow is seen as the copper oxide is reduced.<br>
 6CuO (s) + C2H5OH (l) --> 6Cu (s) + 3H2O (l) + 2CO2 (g)<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.10.2H">10.10.2</a> Reduce copper (I) oxide to copper.<br>
<a href="../images/10.10.1ch.gif">See diagram 10.10.2</a>: Copper oxide to copper.<br>
 Most school science laboratories are not equipped to show the reactions that occur in a blast furnace.<br>
 Heat copper (I) oxide on a charcoal block until brown colours are observed in the residue.<br>
 Cool the bead formed then grind it with a mortar and pestle and examine with a magnifier.<br>
 Compare the reaction of dilute nitric acid with the ground residue and with copper filings.<br>
 The residue might be copper.<br>
 Repeat the procedure using red iron oxide.<br>
 Test the ground up residue with a magnet.<br>
 You have extracted copper from copper oxide and iron from iron oxide by their reaction with carbon.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.10.3H">10.10.3</a> Reduce iron (III) chloride with hydrogen sulfide<br>
 Hydrogen sulfide reduces yellow acidified iron (III) chloride to green Fe 2+ with precipitation of sulfur.<br> 
 Add sodium hydroxide to the filtered precipitate to form a green-brown precipitate of iron (II) hydroxide.<br> 

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.10.4H">10.10.4</a> Reduce iron (III) chloride with sulfur dioxide<br>
 Pass sulfur dioxide through brown-yellow iron (III) chloride solution.
 Sulfur dioxide reduces iron (III) chloride to Fe 2+ .<br>
 The reaction turns red.<br>
 Pour off some solution and boil.<br>
 The solution turns green.<br>
 Add drops of sodium hydroxide solution.<br>
 The reaction forms a brown-red precipitate of iron (III) hydroxide.<br>
 FeCl3 (aq) + 3NaOH (aq) --> Fe(OH)3 (s) +NaCl (aq)<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.10.5H">10.10.5</a>Reduce metal oxides to metals, red lead to lead and oxygen.<br>
<a href="../images/10.10.1ch.gif">See diagram 10.10.1</a>: "Red lead" to lead and oxygen.<br>
 1. Use a crucible lid to heat red or orange "red lead " (red lead oxide), molecular formula Pb3O4 (2PbO.PbO2), lead tetroxide (triplumbic tetroxide, minium).<br>
 If you heat "red lead" in a glass test-tube, the lead compounds in "red lead" may combine with the lead in the glass causing the glass to crack and spill its hot contents.<br>
 The "red lead" melts at 500 o C, then decomposes to the yellow solid lead (II) oxide (lead monoxide, litharge) and oxygen gas.<br>
 Test the gas evolved with a glowing splint.<br>
 Put some yellow residue in a cavity in a charcoal block.<br>
 Heat the metal oxide strongly with a blowpipe.<br>
 The residue is the element lead.<br>
 You have extracted oxygen and lead from "red lead".<br>
 2Pb3O4 (s) --&gt; 6PbO (s) + O2 (g).<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.10.6H">10.10.6</a> Reduce metal oxides to metals with hydrogen gas<br>
<a href="../images/3.41.3ch.gif">See diagram 3.41.3ch</a>: Reduce metal oxides to metals with hydrogen gas<br>
<a href="../images/3.41.3x.gif">See diagram 3.41.3x</a>: Hydrogen over heated copper oxide<br>
 Be careful! Use a safety screen and wear eye protection.<br> 
 1. Pass hydrogen gas over copper (II) oxide, or lead (II) oxide (lithage) or iron (III) oxide.<br> 
 Hydrogen gas reduces metal oxides to metals.<br> 
 The products are the metal and water.<br> 
 CuO (s) + H2 (g)--> Cu (s) + H2O (l)<br>
 2. Pass hydrogen over 5 g of copper (II) oxide (CuO, black copper oxide) or lead (II) oxide (lead monoxide.<br> 
 PbO, lithage) or iron (III) oxide (haematite, Fe2O3).<br>
 Hydrogen reduces metal oxides to metals.<br> 
 The products are the metal and water.<br> 
 Weigh a reduction tube empty then with copper oxide.<br> 
 Pass hydrogen over the copper oxide and light the gas as it comes out of the hole in the end of the combustion tube.<br> 
 Heat the copper oxide with a Bunsen burner flame until it glows then turns pink.<br> 
 The glow shows that reduction occurs.<br> 
 Remove the Bunsen burner.<br> 
 Let the combustion tube cool then discontinue the supply of hydrogen.<br>
 When the flame has gone out, remove the stopper and weigh the reduction tube and contents again.<br> 
 CuO (s) + H2 (g)--> Cu (s) + H2O (l)<br>
 In the industrial process, blistered copper is heated in a furnace and natural gas is passed through the molten copper oxide until the flame burns green.<br>
This indicates that almost pure copper remains.<br> 
 3. Repeat the experiment with 5 g of copper (I) oxide (red copper oxide, Cu2O).<br> 

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.10.7H">10.10.7</a> Reduce potassium manganate (VII) with hydrogen sulfide<br>
 Do this experiment in a fume cupboard, fume hood.<br> 
 Pass hydrogen sulfide through a dilute acidified potassium manganate (VII) solution.<br> 
 The colour of the manganate ion is lost and a milky precipitate of sulfur forms.<br> 
 2MnO4 - (aq) + 6H + (aq) + 5H2S (g) --> 2Mn 2+ (aq) + 8H2O (l) + 5S (s)<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.10.8H">10.10.8</a> Reduce potassium manganate (VII) with sulfur dioxide<br>
 Add 10 mL of 0.1M potassium manganate (VII) solution and 10 mL of 3M dilute sulfuric acid solution to 200 mL of water containing sulfur dioxide.<br>
 The solution will gradually become colourless as the sulfur dioxide reacts with the potassium permanganate.<br>
 The colour of the manganate ion is lost as the sulfurous acid is oxidized to sulfuric acid.<br>
 Add a 0.25M barium chloride solution when the solution becomes "milky", because of the formation of barium sulfate<br>
 SO2 (g) + H2O (l) --> H2SO3 (aq)<br>
 2MnO4 - (aq) + 6H + (aq) + 5SO3 2- (aq) --> 2Mn 2+ (aq) + 3H2O (l) + 5SO4 2- (aq)<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="10.10.9H">10.10.9</a> Reduce red iron oxide, or rust, to iron<br>
 In a blast furnace, there are 3 reactions when iron ore is smelted, i.e. melted and reduced.<br>
 3Fe2O3 (s) + CO (g) --> 2Fe3O4 + CO2 (g)<br>
 Fe3O4 (s) + CO (g) --> 3FeO (s) + CO2 (g)<br>
 FeO (s) + CO (g) --> Fe (l) + CO2 (g)<br>
 Also, water gas forms.<br>
 H2O (l) + C (s) + energy --> CO (g) + H2 (g) (water gas).<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="13.10.2H">13.10.2</a> Properties of sulfur dioxide and sulfites<br>
Sulfur dioxide has a covalently bonded molecular structure so it does not conduct electricity and has a low melting point and boiling temperature.<br>
Experiments<br>
1. Heat sulfur in an evaporating basin and test the sulfur dioxide formed by drops reagents on a glass rod.<br>
Alternatively, pass sulfur dioxide into 6 cm of water.<br>
Show that the solution is acid, potassium permanganate loses its colour, reduces potassium dichromate, and forms a deposit of sulfur with hydrogen sulfide.<br>
2. Prepare sodium sulfite and sodium bisulfite in solution.<br>

Add 10 mL of sodium hydroxide solution to form sodium sulfite, Na2SO3.<br>
NaOH + SO2 (g) --> NaHSO3<br>
NaHSO3 + NaOH --> Na2SO3 + H2O.<br>
3. Hold 2 cm of magnesium ribbon in a pair tongs 
 and heat until it ignites, then hold the burning magnesium in sulfur dioxide.<br>
Sulfur dioxide decomposes into sulfur and oxygen.<br>
Magnesium oxide forms.<br>
2Mg + SO2 (g) --> 2MgO (s) + S (s)<br>
SO2 (g) --> S (s) + O2 (g)<br>

Unlike barium sulfate, barium sulfite is soluble in dilute hydrochloric acid.<br>
SO3 2- + Ba 2+ --> BaSO3 (s).<br>
8. Add drops of iodine in potassium iodide solution (tincture of iodine) to sodium sulfite solution.<br>
The iodine loses its colour.<br>
Test the final solution for sulfate ion.<br>
