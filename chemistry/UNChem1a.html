 Carbon dioxide (called "gas sylvestre" by Jan Baptist van Helmont, Belgium 1580-1644), is a gas that does not support life, so it is a simple asphyxiant.<br>
 Carbon dioxide and other gases that could accumulate in coal mines to cause choking and suffocation were called choke-damp, after-damp, foul-damp, black damp.<br>
 Miners used to keep a caged canary bird with them that would die before a concentration of carbon dioxide fatal to humans occurred.<br>
 Carbon dioxide is used in photosynthesis.<br>
 Excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from excess burning of fossil fuels causes a greenhouse effect so the temperature of the atmosphere rises, called global warming.<br>
 An increase of the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere may increase the rate of photosynthesis.<br>
 At standard temperature and pressure, the density of carbon dioxide is approximately 1.98 kg / m<sup>3</sup>, i.e., about 1.5 X the density of air.<br>
 Carbon dioxide is not liquid at pressures below 5.1 standard atmospheres, 520 kPa.<br>
 At 1 atmosphere, approximately mean sea level pressure, the gas precipitates directly as a solid at temperatures below -78.5 C, and the solid sublimes directly to a gas above -78.5 C.<br>
 Solid state carbon dioxide is commonly called "dry ice" and is used by travelling ice cream sellers.<br>
 Liquid carbon dioxide forms only at pressures above 5.1 atm.<br>
 The triple point of carbon dioxide is approximately 518 kPa at -56.6 C.<br>
 The critical point above which distinct liquid and gas phases do not exist is 7.38 MPa at 31.1<sup>o</sup>C.<br>

<a href="../images/3.34.1ch.gif">See diagram 3.34.1</a>: Limewater test for carbon dioxide<br>
 Limewater test A The limewater turns milky.<br> 
 1. Prepare the weak alkali calcium hydroxide solution, limewater, by adding solid calcium hydroxide, slaked lime, to demineralized water.<br> 
 Shake the solution vigorously and leave to stand.<br> 
 Calcium hydroxide solid is only slightly soluble in water.<br> 
 When a white solid has settled as a fine white sediment, decant the clear limewater above the sediment.<br> 
 To replenish the limewater, add more demineralized water to the sediment in the stock bottle, shake and allow to settle.<br> 
 The settling process may take several days.<br> 
2. Prepare limewater by adding calcium oxide (quicklime) to water to form calcium hydroxide.<br> 
 CaO (s) + H2O (l)--> Ca(OH)2 (s)<br>
 calcium oxide + water--> calcium hydroxide<br>
 Then the calcium hydroxide dissolves in water to form a weak alkaline solution.<br> 
 Limewater is a saturated solution of calcium hydroxide.<br> 
 Ca(OH)2 (aq) &lt; = &gt; Ca<sup>2+</sup> (aq) + 2OH<sup>-</sup> (aq)<br>
When testing for the presence of carbon dioxide, make a fresh solution of limewater, otherwise the surface turns milky on standing, because of the reaction with
the carbon dioxide in the air.<br> 
Store limewater in a container with a rubber or plastic stopper.<br> 
If you use a screw top container, calcium carbonate may form in the screw of the lid, so you cannot open the container.<br> 
3. Pass carbon dioxide through limewater or blow through it.<br> 
 Carbon dioxide turns limewater milky.<br> 
 A fine suspension of calcium carbonate causes the milky colour in the Ca(OH)2 (s) + CO2 (g) --> CaCO3 (s) + H2O (l)<br>
 Pass more carbon dioxide through the solution.<br> 
 The solution becomes clear again, because soluble calcium hydrogen carbonate forms.<br> 
 CaCO3 (s) + CO2 (g) + H2O (l) --> Ca(HCO3)2 (aq)<br>
 The reaction can be reversed to form the calcium carbonate precipitate once again, either by boiling the solution or bubbling air through it.<br> 
 4. Pass air through freshly made limewater.<br> 
 After a long time may see a faint cloudy precipitate.<br> 
 The air contains about 0.4% carbon dioxide.<br> 
 5. Use a drinking straw to exhale into the limewater .<br> 
 A cloudy precipitate soon forms, because exhaled breath contains about 4% carbon dioxide.<br> 
 6. Pass carbon dioxide into water to form carbonic acid.<br> 
 CO2 (g) + H2O (l)--> H2CO3 (aq)<br>
 Add limewater to neutralize the carbonic acid to form the carbonate ion<br>
 H2CO3 (aq) + 2OH<sup>-</sup> (aq)--> CO3<sup>2-</sup> (aq) + 4H2O (l)<br>
 Calcium carbonate is insoluble and precipitates<br>
 Ca<sup>2+</sup> (aq) + CO3<sup>2-</sup> (aq)--> CaCO3 (s)<br>
 Pass more carbon dioxide into the solution to use up the OH<sup>-</sup> and make the solution acidic, so the carbonate ion is converted into the soluble bicarbonate ion.<br> 
 CaCO3 (s)+ H2CO3 (aq)--> Ca<sup>2+</sup> (aq) + 2HCO3<sup>-</sup> (aq)<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.5.3H"></a>3.5.3 Tests for carbon dioxide with burning charcoal<br>
 Put limewater into a container with a lid.<br>
 Attach charcoal to the end of a wire.<br>
 Ignite the charcoal with a Bunsen burner.<br>
 Hold the burning charcoal in the container above the surface of the lime water.<br>
 Remove the burning charcoal.<br>
 Close the container and shake it.<br>
 The solution turns a milky colour.<br>
 The formation of this white solid in limewater is a test for carbon dioxide.<br>
 No other gas does this.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.5.4H"></a>3.5.4 Tests for carbon dioxide with "pouring tests"<br>
1. Test whether carbon dioxide gas is heavier than air by "pouring" the gas into a test-tube, held either above the first test-tube or below it.<br>
Use a lighted taper to investigate where the carbon dioxide has gone.<br>
2. Test the density of the carbon dioxide by "pouring" the gas into a container containing a short lighted candle, e.g. a happy birthday candle.<br>
The carbon dioxide extinguishes the lighted candle.<br>

 Carbonation, dissolving CO2 in water under pressure to become effervescent, fizzy.<br>
 Carbon dioxide is an acidic oxide that dissolves in water to form the weak acid carbonic acid (H2CO3), pH about 4, and the carbonate ion.<br>
 H2O (l) + CO2 (g) &lt;--> H2CO3 (aq)<br>
 Carbonation is the dissolving of carbon dioxide in water under pressure to become effervescent, fizzy.<br>
 Do not store carbonic acid, because it easily decomposes to carbon dioxide and water.<br>
 Soda water is carbon dioxide dissolved in water under pressure that makes the gas more soluble.<br>
 Carbonic acid is the basis for all aerated waters, e.g. fizzy lemonade or cola, gaseous natural spring waters and sparkling wines.<br>
 If a glass of cold fizzy drink is left on the table, as the temperature of the drink increases, carbon dioxide is lost from the drink as bubbles of carbon dioxide escape, effervescence, and the drink becomes "flat".<br>
 Carbonic acid soon decomposes, but it can form stable sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate and hydrogen carbonate salts.<br>
 Aerated water, carbonated water, soda water, club soda, "soda", sparkling water, seltzer water, dissolved CO2 by carbonation to prepare effervescent fizzy drinks, soft drinks.<br>
 Carbonic acid, H2CO3 is the basis for all aerated waters, e.g. fizzy lemonade, cola, bottled gaseous natural spring waters and sparkling wines.<br>
 Carbonation is the dissolving of CO2 in water under pressure to become effervescent, "fizzy"<br>
 In 1772, Joseph Priestly published "Directions for Impregnating Water with Fixed Air", passing gas from sulfuric acid on chalk through water.<br>
 The process was developed to produce soda water by the Swiss chemist Jacob Schweppe in London.<br>
 His company still functions to produce aerated water.<br>
 Seltzer water was first produced in 1775 from water at Seltz in France on the Rhine River, but nowadays it is soda water.<br>
 Soda water and club soda may also contain sodium salts.<br>
 In USA, "soda" is any soft drink.<br>

 If dry ice is touched, the moisture on the skin freezes and the dry ice  sticks to the skin, causing frostbite.<br>
 When carbon dioxide is cooled under pressure, it becomes a solid.<br>
 Dry ice is used as a refrigerant by mobile ice cream sellers, in fire  extinguishers, and for stage effects to produce artificial smoke or mist.<br>
 At atmospheric pressure dry ice sublimes at -78.5<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
 The temperature of dry ice is always &lt; 78.5<sup>o</sup>C at atmospheric pressure, whatever the air temperature.<br>

2. Dry ice in water<br>
 Fill a 10 cc measuring cylinder water and add universal indicator.<br>
 Add drops of sodium hydroxide solution.<br>
 Add a lump dry ice.<br>
 Note how the dry ice sinks to the bottom and gives off bubbles of carbon dioxide to make a fog at the mouth of the measuring cylinder.<br>

 Prepare carbon dioxide by adding vinegar to sodium bicarbonate in a beaker.<br>
 Hold the beaker above one of the plastic bags and pour the invisible carbon dioxide into the bag without pouring out any froth or chemicals.<br>
 The plastic bag containing the carbon dioxide sinks down showing that carbon dioxide is heavier than air.<br>
 The density of carbon dioxide is about 1.98 g per litre, which is about 1.5 × as heavy as air.<br>
 The fact that you can pour the carbon dioxide into the plastic bag shows that it is heavier than air.<br>
 2. Weight of carbon dioxide<br>
 Attach a drawing pin, sharp side up, to the corner of a flat table.<br>
 Attach a small plastic bag to each end of a wooden ruler.<br>

 Washing soda (sodium carbonate decahydrate, Na2CO3.10H2O), allows sodium ions to displace calcium ions in clay particles so that clay particles in mud can be dispersed and held in suspension in the 
 washing water.<br>
 Baking soda (sodium hydrogen carbonate, bicarbonate of soda, baking powder), is used in cooking to form bubbles of carbon dioxide to expand bread dough, cake mix and pastry dough, to make them 
light and pleasant to eat.<br>
 Baking powders often contain a solid acid that reacts with  the sodium hydrogen carbonate only when moist.<br>
 Baking powder contains sodium hydrogen carbonate (sodium bicarbonate),  which reacts with an acid, e.g. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid,  (lactic acid), from sour milk, to form carbon dioxide.<br>
 The heat from the oven helps the decomposition of sodium hydrogen carbonate  to form carbon dioxide.<br>
 Yeast cells convert sugar to carbon dioxide gas and alcohol to make bread  rise.<br>
 Baking powder, or sodium bicarbonate, NHCO3, reacts with an acid such as lactic acid from sour milk to produce carbon dioxide.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.38.1H"></a>3.38.1 Test for carbon dioxide  as a greenhouse gas<br>
 The carbon dioxide level decreases during the day through the photosynthesis  of green plants, and increases at night when these plant  respire and release it.<br>
 So the blanketing effect on heat movement would increase at night impeding  radiation of heat away from the surface of the earth and  cause higher surface temperatures.<br>
 If the concentration of carbon dioxide was stable at all times it would  impede as much incoming heat to the surface of the earth as  outgoing heat.<br>
 When a cloud cover forms at the end of a clear day, it blankets the movement  of heat from the lower atmosphere to the upper  atmospheres so the night temperature does not drop as much as on a clear 
 night.<br>
 If the cloud cover is there in the day and the night sky is clear, the same clouds become the opposite of a greenhouse gas.<br>

 Add only about 1.4 cc of carbon dioxide to double the concentration from  the ambient level to 700 parts per million, then seal the  hole with adhesive tape.<br>
 Insulate the apparatus with styrofoam and locate it out of direct sunlight  and away from moving air.<br>

 Pour both solutions into the drink bottle, but not enough to cover the candle!.<br>
 Bubbles of carbon dioxide appear and then the candle goes out.<br>
 You cannot relight the candle with a lighted match, because of the carbon  dioxide around the candle and carbon dioxide is heavier  than air.<br>
 So the match goes out before you can light the candle.<br>
 Some people can blow a soap bubble with a bubble pipe and sit the bubble  on top of the layer of carbon dioxide, but doing this is not easy.<br>
 Light the sparkler and hold the sparkling end in the drink bottle.<br>
 The sparkler does not go out, because the sparkles come from burning magnesium  powder and magnesium reacts with carbon dioxide.<br>

 Put a candy, e.g. a spearmint candy, "Mentos", into a test-tube.<br>
 Add aerated water, e.g. cola, diet cola.<br>
 Observe the bubbles of carbon dioxide coming from the surface of the candy.<br>
 The grainy surface of the candy provides nucleation sites for the formation of carbon dioxide gas from carbon dioxide in the cola solution.<br>
 It snags small dissolved bubbles that coalesce to form large bubbles, which in turn coalesce to form gigantic bubbles that break off and move upwards like rockets, whooshing through any nozzle.<br>
 "Diet colas" usually works better than other colas, because they usually contain corn syrup that inhibits bubble formation.<br>
 <b>Be careful!</b> Too many Mentos tablets in a cola bottle may injure people from the resulting explosion!<br>
 The geyser effect is caused by the uncoloured, unglazed version of Mentos that provides nucleation sites for the dissolved carbon dioxide in the cola to escape as a gas.<br>
 Other active ingredients in the cascade effect reaction include the artificial sweetener, aspartame, the preservative, potassium benzoate, and caffeine in the diet cola.<br>
 Also, Mentos contains gum arabic and gelatin.<br>
 The ingredients add to the nucleation, to create a chemical reaction that forces the soda to release immediately all of its dissolved carbon dioxide, causing a more violent eruption than only carbonated water (soda 
 water).<br>
 By using a nozzle, the geyser can reach 9.1 m.<br>
 However, it may extend to 10 m by using rock salt, which is more porous and provides even more nucleation sites per unit area than Mentos.<br>
