<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.1.1H">3.1.1</a> Boiling point of liquids<br>
Evaporation occurs only at the surface of liquids, but may occur at all temperatures.<br>
When boiling occurs, bubbles form inside the liquid and the liquid boils at a definite temperature, the boiling point depending on the pressure.<br>
When boiling occurs the temperature of the liquid remains constant until all the liquid has evaporated.<br>
The liquid boils when the saturation pressure is equal to the pressure acting on the surface of the liquid.<br>
Air bubbles form first as small nuclei increasing in size with temperature.<br>
When bubbles of vapour form in a boiling liquid, the vapour pressure of the gas in the bubbles is greater than atmospheric pressure.<br>
When the chemical bonds between liquid molecules are strong, only a few molecules can break the bonds to become a vapour.<br>
Smaller molecules usually have lower boiling points.<br>
The boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which the liquid boils when exposed to the atmosphere.<br>
So the boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which the vapour pressure of the liquid equals the pressure of the atmosphere, 1 atmosphere.<br>
At 100 oC, the vapour pressure of pure water is one atmosphere (101.325 KPa, kNm-2).<br>
The boiling point varies with pressure, so water boils at <100 oC on high mountains.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.1.2H">3.1.2</a> Boiling point of inflammable liquids<br>
<a href="../images/3.6x.gif">See diagram 3.6</a>: Boiling point of inflammable liquids.<br>
 A rubber band, B capillary tube, C test-tube, D inflammable liquid, E thermometer<br>
 1. Do not use a Bunsen burner to find the boiling point of inflammable liquids, e.g. ethanol (B P 78.4 oC) and acetone (B P 56 oC).<br>
 Use an electric hot plate or use the following method.<br>
 Pour 2 cm of the inflammable liquid into a test-tube in an empty container.<br>
 Place a thermometer in the test-tube with its bulb in the liquid.<br>
 Boil water in an electric jug or on an electrical hot plate.<br>
 Pour the hot water into the container so that the level is higher than the inflammable liquid in the test-tube.<br>
 Stir the inflammable liquid gently with the thermometer and read thermometer when the inflammable liquid boils.<br>
 It is not good practice to stir liquids with thermometers!<br>
2. Use a very small test-tube or seal one end of a piece of glass tubing, 8 cm length and 3 cm external diameter.<br>
 Put the inflammable liquid into this test-tube.<br>
 Put a capillary tube, sealed at one end, into the inflammable liquid with the sealed end up and the open end down in the inflammable liquid.<br>
 Use a rubber band to attach the test-tube containing inflammable and capillary tube to the bulb of a thermometer.<br>
 Hold the apparatus in a container of water and heat gently with an electric hot plate.<br>
 When the temperature rises, bubbles slowly come out of the capillary tube.<br>
 At the boiling point the bubbles suddenly come out as a steady stream.<br>
 Read the temperature.<br>
 Let the water cool and read the temperature again when the steady stream of bubbles stops.<br>
 Calculate the boiling point as the average of the two readings.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.1.3H">3.1.3</a> Boiling point of sodium chloride solution<br>
 1. A solution of sodium chloride in water boils at a higher temperature and has a lower freezing point than pure water.<br>
 Use freezing points and boiling points to find the purity of substances.<br>
 Use three test-tubes containing the same volume of water.<br>
 Add some sodium chloride to the second test-tube.<br>
 Keep adding sodium chloride to the third test-tube until no more dissolves to produce a saturated solution at that temperature.<br>
 Join the test-tubes with an elastic band.<br>
 Heat the test-tubes equally over a Bunsen burner.<br>
 The first test-tube containing only water boils first.<br>
 The second test-tube containing some sodium chloride boils next.<br>
 The third test-tube containing the saturated solution of sodium chloride boils last.<br>
 However, it is reported that the addition of 20 g of salt to 5 litres of water increases the boiling temperature to only 100.04 oC.!<br>
 2. Put a beaker containing demineralized water in a broad pan containing a concentrated salt solution.<br>
 Slowly heat the broad pan and note that the demineralized water boils first.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.1.5H">3.1.5</a> Boiling point of water<br>
<a href="../images/3.5x.gif">See diagram 3.5</a>: Boiling point of water.<br>
 1. Pour water into a test-tube.<br>
 Hold a thermometer with its bulb just under the water.<br>
 Heat very slowly by moving the test-tube in and out of the flame or add boiling chips, anti-bumping granules.<br>
 Heat the water gently until it boils.<br>
 Record the temperature.<br>
 Note the same temperature in all parts of the test-tube.<br>
 Note any change in the reading if the thermometer touches the bottom of the test-tube.<br>
 The water must cover the bulb of the thermometer and the bulb must not touch the sides of the test-tube.<br>
 2. Show that the boiling point of water does not depend on the size of the container.<br>
 Repeat the experiment with a large container.<br>
 Heat the water quickly.<br>
 The water first starts to boil near the bottom and sides of the container.<br>
 Note the temperature in different parts of the container.<br>
 Note any change in the reading if the thermometer touches the bottom of the container.<br>
 The boiling point is the same in small and large containers.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.1.6H">3.1.6</a> Elevation of boiling points, ebullioscopy constant, kB<br>
 The boiling point of a liquid is raised if substances are dissolved in it.<br>
 The elevation is proportional to the number of particles or molecules or ions dissolved in the liquid.<br>
 The elevation in oC = the molal concentration of the solute in the liquid × a constant.<br>
 The value of the constant (ebullioscopy constant, kB) depends on the solvent.<br>
 So if kB is known, the molecular weight of the solute can be calculated.<br>
 Addition of substances to water used for cooking has little effect on cooking time, because adding a tablespoon (20 g), of sodium 
 chloride (common salt), to 5 litres of water increases the boiling point of pure water by only 0.04 oC.<br>
 The presence of a solute both raises the boiling point and lowers the freezing point of the solvent.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.1.7H">3.1.7 </a> Leidenfrost effect, water drops on hot stove<br>
 An insulating layer of vapour may support liquids hotter than the liquid's boiling point.<br>
 Let drops of water fall on a very hot stove top.<br>
 The drops do not immediately evaporate or spread into a puddle, but jump around supported by a vapour layer below them caused by the high heat that evaporated some of the liquid.<br>
 The liquid floats on this vapour cushion and boils without bubbling.<br>
 If the hot surface suddenly cools, the vapour layer can collapse and the water bubbles explosively.<br>
 In chemical factories, there is a risk of explosion if water touches very hot metal, but this may be controlled if the metal has a rough texture.<br>
 Similarly, liquid nitrogen may mover erratically over the floor.<br>
 Foolish experimenters have demonstrated the Leidenfrost effect by dipping their fingers in molten lead with temperature &gt; 450 oC<br>
 Do not try to demonstrate this molten lead experiment in the laboratory!<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.1.8H">3.1.8</a> Volatility of different liquids, perfume<br>
 Evaporation is the movement of particles from the surface of a liquid to the gas state, when below the boiling point.<br>
 Volatile liquids evaporate readily at room temperatures.<br>
 1. Select liquids from the laboratory, e.g. water, methylated spirits, gasoline, mineral turpentine, kerosene (paraffin oil), household oil, machine oil, car oil, vinegar, vanilla essence, eucalyptus oil, glycerine.<br>
 Wet a 5 cm piece of absorbent paper with a liquid.<br>
 Write the name of the test liquid in pencil.<br>
 Attach the piece of paper to a horizontal string.<br>
 Examine the paper every ten minutes, every two hours, and each day.<br>
 2. Repeat the experiment with perfumes.<br>
 Smell the paper every ten minutes, every two hours and each day.<br>
 Some perfumes soon disappear, but others last for days.<br>
 Record the relative "person-attracting" capacity for each perfume!<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.2.1H">3.2.1</a> Heat substances that decompose and lose mass when heated<br>
<a href="../images/3.30x.gif">See diagram 3.30</a>: Heat copper sulfate crystals.<br>
 The phrase "Substances that do not decompose when heated" refers to substances that remain stable after heating constantly with a Bunsen burner flame.<br>
 However, all compounds breakdown when heated to a high enough temperature.<br>
 1. Most carbonates decompose to form carbon dioxide and a metallic oxide.<br>
 Sodium hydrogen carbonate, NaHCO3 (sodium bicarbonate), begins to lose carbon dioxide at 50 oC to form sodium carbonate.<br>
 A solution of a sodium hydrogen carbonate begins to lose carbon dioxide at 20 oC.<br>
 2. Hydroxides decompose to form water and a metallic oxide.<br>
 3. Nitrates decompose to form oxygen, nitrogen dioxide and a metallic oxide, except potassium nitrate and sodium nitrate that form 
 the nitrite and oxygen.<br>
 Lead nitrate decomposes at 470 oC.<br>
 4. Nearly all oxides are stable, e.g. zinc oxide, ZnO, MP above 1, 800 oC.<br>
 5. Some sulfates decompose to form sulfur trioxide and metallic oxide.<br>
 6. Metal compounds higher in the activity series are usually more stable 
 than compounds of metals lower in the activity series.<br>
 7. Some salts first lose water of crystallization and then become stable.<br>
 8. The salts that remain stable when heated constantly with a Bunsen burner flame are calcium sulfate, potassium chloride, potassium sulfate, sodium carbonate, sodium chloride, and sodium sulfate.<br>
 Ammonium oxalate (NH4COO)2, and ammonium dichromate (NH4)2Cr2O7, decompose before melting.<br>
 Ammonium sulfate (NH4)2SO4, decomposes above 280 oC.<br>
 9. Boric acid, H3BO3, loses water until it decomposes to the anhydride, B2O3.<br>
 10. Oxalic acid begins to sublime at 100 oC, becomes anhydrous at 189 oC and when heated rapidly decomposes into carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, formic acid and water.<br>
 11. Potassium chlorate, KClO3, decomposes above 368 oC into potassium perchlorate and oxygen.<br>
 Potassium ferricyanide, K2Fe(CN)6, decomposesbefore melting.<br>
 12. Monosodium orthophosphate, NaH2PO4.H2O, and disodium orthophosphate (disodium hydrogen phosphate (V), Na2HPO4.12H2O, lose water of crystallization.<br>
Experiments<br>
 1. Heat copper sulfate crystals.<br>
 Put 4 cm of crushed blue copper (II) sulfate crystals in a dry test-tube fitted with a one-hole stopper and delivery tube.<br>
 Heat the dry test-tube and crystals gently.<br>
 Note whether vapour collects on the cooler parts of the dry test-tube and whether any liquid collects in the receiving test-tube.<br>
 Observe any change of colour of the crystals from blue to white.<br>
 Identity the liquid in the receiving test-tube by measuring the boiling point.<br>
 When all the copper (II) sulfate crystals have become white and the dry test-tube has cooled, pour the liquid in the receiving test-tube back on the white crystals.<br>
 Note whether the blue colour of the crystals is restored and if any heat is given off.<br>
 (blue) copper (II) sulfate crystals + heat &lt; = &gt; (white) anhydrous copper (II) sulfate + water.<br>
 2. Prepare test-tubes containing 1 cm of (a) iodine crystals (b) sodium hydrogen carbonate granules or crystals (c) silica sand (d) zinc oxide.<br>
 Fix a cotton wool plug in the mouth of each test-tube to prevent loss of solid during heating, then weigh each test-tube.<br>
 Heat each test-tube and cotton wool plug thoroughly and weigh it again.<br>
 Note any change in weight, because of the loss of water of crystallization.<br>
 3. Put black, shiny crystals of iodine in an evaporating dish.<br>
 Cover the dish with a piece of filter paper and stand a filter funnel upside down on the dish.<br>
 Heat the dish gently.<br>
 Purple vapours rise through the filter paper.<br>
 As they cool in the filter funnel, shiny black crystals of iodine form again.<br>
 4. Heat sodium hydrogen carbonate crystals.<br>
 The crystals lose water and carbon dioxide, and at 100 oC are converted to sodium carbonate.<br>
 5. Silica sand consists of pieces of silicon (IV) oxide (SiO2) crystals.<br>
 Heat sand in a crucible.<br>
 The sand particles may break up physically, but do not break up chemically.<br>
 6. Heat zinc oxide in a crucible.<br>
 The colour changes from white to yellow, but no change in weight occurs.<br>
 The substance does not decompose and does not gain anything from the air or lose anything to the air.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.3.1H">3.3.1</a> Ice melts, de-icers<br>
 1. Calcium chloride, can melts ice down to -31.7 oC, and gives off heat as it dissolves to melt the ice quicker than other de-icers, but leaves a slimy residue, corrosive to metal, damages vegetation if over-application.<br>
 2. Magnesium chloride is less corrosive and safer on concrete and plants, fast-acting and more effective at de-icing than rock salt, over-application can damage plants
and keep pavement wet. 
 3. Sodium chloride, rock salt, least expensive and very efficient, melts ice down to -6.7 oC, dries icy surfaces, not harmful to concrete, but damages vegetation, corrosive to metal and may leach into soil and contaminate groundwater.<br>
 However, saltwater freezes at -18 oC, so salt is an ineffective de-icer below this temperature.<br>
 4. Potassium chloride, more expensive than other ice melt products, but works well as 50/50 with rock salt.<br>
 It can melt ice down to -25 oC, but can cause plant injury.<br>
 5. Urea, melts ice to -9 oC, but may harm vegetation with excess nitrogen or may add useful nitrogen fertilizer to plants, frequently used by gardeners, but
potential of runoff into water sources.<br> 
 6. Calcium magnesium acetate, [CaMg2(CH3COO)6], (CMA), from dolomite limestone and acetic acid, not effective below -6.7 oC, only slight affect on plants and concrete, does not form a brine-like salts, prevents snow particles from sticking together on road surface, prevents re-freezing and leave a slush.<br>
 When the freezing point of water is lowered by creating a brine, freeze/thaw cycles and expansion of freezing water can damage concrete.<br>
 However, calcium magnesium acetate has relatively few environmental impacts, because it readily biodegrades and does not persist in the environment.<br>
7. Potassium acetate is a high-performing de-icer, which is biodegradable and non-corrosive.<br>
8. Beet Juice is quicker and less toxic for melting ice on roads and it has less of an impact on the environment, because it is a natural material.<br>
It can lower the melting point of water to -29 oC.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.3.2H">3.3.2</a> Impurities affect the melting point of a substance<br>
 Mix stearic acid with the naphthalene to make the naphthalene impure.<br>
 Note changes in the melting point.<br>
 Impurities lower the melting point.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.3.3H">3.3.3</a> Melting point, MP, of solids<br>
<a href="../images/3.3.3.jpg">See diagram 3.3.3< /a>: Melting point curves - Pure substance and impure substance<br>
"DigiMelt"" is a modern, low cost, digital melting point apparatus designed specifically for the student lab.", (Commercial)<br>
 The melting point (MP or fusing point), is the temperature at which a solid starts to liquefy.<br>
 The melting point and freezing point of a pure substance are the same temperature.<br>
 Melting (fusion), is the "solid to liquid" type of phase change.<br>
 Other phase changes include change from liquid to solid (freezing), solid to gas (sublimation), liquid to gas (evaporation), gas to liquid (condensation).<br>
 Pure substances melt at constant temperature.<br>
 Impurities lower the melting point.<br>
 Impure substances, e.g. alloys, melt over a range of temperature.<br>
 The melting point graph for a pure substance is horizontal as the solid melts.<br>
 The melting point graph for an impure substance has an inclined line as the solid melts.<br>
 Melting points and melting behaviours can be used to identify a substance and decide if it is pure.<br>
 Melting is also called fusion and the melting point can be called the fusing point.<br>
 The melting point of glass is 1400-1600 oC, depending on the composition of the glass.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.3.4H">3.3.4</a> Melting point and cooling curve of stearic acid<br>
<a href="../images/3.2.2ch.gif">See diagram 3.2.2</a>: Melting point and cooling curve of stearic acid<br>
 Stearic acid melts at 69 oC.<br>
 Stearic acid (octadecanoic acid), is a safer alternative to using naphthalene for the following experiments:<br>
 1. Put 2 cm of the acid in a test-tube with a thermometer.<br>
 Put the test-tube in a beaker containing water.<br>
 Heat the beaker tube gently until the acid just melts.<br>
 Note the time and remove the test-tube from the beaker.<br>
 Note the temperature every 30 seconds as the substance cools.<br>
 The acid solidifies again at the same temperature.<br>
 Heat the test-tube again to free thermometer.<br>
 Draw the cooling curve of the acid.<br>
 Plot temperature on the vertical axis and time on the horizontal axis.<br>
 When the acid is changing from liquid to solid, the curve is horizontal.<br>
 2. For a more accurate method to measure melting points, heat one end of a 10 cm capillary tube to seal it and put octadecanoic acid in the capillary tube.<br>
 Attach the capillary tube to a thermometer with a rubber band.<br>
 Put thermometer in a beaker of water.<br>
 Heat the water while stirring with thermometer.<br>
 Record the temperature at which the acid melts.<br>
 Leave the capillary tube to cool.<br>
 Record the temperature at which the acid solidifies.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.3.6H">3.3.6</a> Melting point and pressure<br>
<a href="../images/24.1.3.gif">See diagram 24.1.3</a>: Melting point and pressure.<br>
<a href="../images/24.1.3a.gif">See diagram 24.1.3a</a>: Regelation.<br>
Regelation is when ice melts under pressure and refreezing when pressure is reduced.<br>
Increase of pressure increases the freezing point of substances, but increase of pressure on substances that expand on freezing lowers the freezing point.<br>
So increased pressure on ice turns it to liquid, but when increased pressure stops the ice freezes again without change in temperature, regelation.<br>
Experiments<br>
1. Regelation<br>
Cut through a block of ice with a copper wire loop that has a heavy mass hanging from each end.<br>
Copper wire cuts through faster than iron or cotton thread.<br>
At the start of the experiment the copper wire should be the same temperature as the ice, otherwise it is just transferring heat and melting the ice.<br>
When the copper wire exerts pressure on the ice below it the ice melts, because its melting point is now lower.<br>
The ice under pressure is still at 0 oC, which is above its melting point.<br>
So the wire sinks down through the melt water.<br>
However, above the wire the pressure decreases to near atmospheric pressure.<br>
The melt water still at 0 oC refreezes. because the melting point is again 0 oC.<br>
The refreezing water above the wire loses latent heat of fusion, which is conducted down to the copper wire and increases the melting process.<br>
The copper wire keeps passing down through the whole block of ice, cutting it on two and joining the cut regions together again.<br>
2. When you apply pressure to ice, you lower the freezing point of it.<br>
Freeze a rectangular ice cube in a freezer.<br>
Put it on a wooden board.<br>
Tie 500 g weights to each end of a thin nylon thread.<br>
Spread the thread across the upper surface of the ice and hang the weights at each side.<br>
Observe the ice melting below the thread as it cuts slowly into the ice.<br>
If the temperature is low enough, as the ice freezes the ice above the thread can freeze again, regelation.<br>
Then you can lift the ice cube by nylon thread.<br>
Substances that expand on freezing show a lowering melting point under pressure.<br>
3. Tie the ends of a 50 cm length of iron wire or nylon cord to two 10 cm lengths of cut broomstick to act as handles.<br>
 Lean over a block of ice, grip the handles and use them to push the wire or cord down onto it.<br>
 Move the wire from side to side and with a downward motion, as if you are sawing on the ice.<br>
 Eventually you can move the wired or cord down through the whole block of ice, but it remains as one block of ice.<br>
4. Push your finger down on the middle of an ice cube.<br>
Some ice at the upper surface melts, because of the increased temperature and pressure.<br>
Sprinkle salt on the ice cube and press it again.<br>
The ice cube melts slower. because salt lowers the melting point of ice.<br>
5. Squeeze crushed ice in a thick walled cylinder to form a solid block.<br>
In a snowball fight, throw loose snow only.<br>
If you squeeze the snow in your gloved hand, you create a rocky piece of ice that is dangerous to throw.<br>
6. The ice under a skaters ice skates quickly melts under the skate then refreezes again when the skater has passed.<br>
However, some people claim that pressure from ice skates is not enough to melt ice, except when the temperature is a fraction of a degree below 0 oC.<br>
Skates move easily over ice, because a very thin layer of water already on the ice lowers the friction, and melting from frictional heating give more water lubricant.<br>

 "Ice Melting Blocks", endothermic heat flow (toy product).<br>
 For pure substances, the melting point (MP) = freezing point (FP).<br>
The melting point of ice at 1 atmosphere of pressure is 0°C (32 °F; 273 K ) = the freezing point of water.<br>
 For water, MP and FP = 0 oC.<br>
 However, freezing mixtures of ice and salt have temperatures below 0 oC.<br>
 The freezing point of water in motor car radiators is lowered by adding antifreeze solutions, e.g. ethylene glycol (ethane-1,2-diol), that does not freeze above -20.6o.<br>
 Freezing points can be used for detecting water in milk or other adulteration.<br>
 2. Use a refrigerator with the temperature in the freezer about -5 oC.<br>
 Cover a 250 mL beaker with insulating material, half fill it with water and add small pieces of ice.<br>
 After 10 minutes, record the temperature of mixture of water and ice with a thermometer.<br>
 Take out some water from the beaker, add smaller pieces of ice just taken from the freezer.<br>
 Add layers of ice and salt until they half fill the beaker.<br>
 Put a test-tube with half full of water into the beaker so that it becomes surrounded by ice.<br>
 Put a thermometer in the test-tube.<br>
 Compare the melting temperature of ice in the beaker with the freezing temperature of water in the test-tube.<br>
 Let the ice in the beaker melt completely and let the water in the tube freeze to ice completely.<br>
 The readings of the two thermometers both reach the same value below 0 oC.<br>
 Observe the liquid water and solid water exist together.<br>
3. Heating curve of water<br>
Crush enough ice cubes to fill a large beaker, insert a thick pencil into the crushed ice and refreeze the crushed ice in the beaker overnight.<br>
The next day, replace the thick pencil with a bulb thermometer and place the beaker on a hot plate.<br>
The starting temperature should be at or below -5 oC.<br> 
Record the inital temperatue in a column and on a sheet of graph paper, then keep recording every 30 seconds.<br>
Continuously stir the solid/liquid mixture with the thermometer until almost all the ice has melted, but do not break the thermometer!<br>
When all the ice has melted, use a retort stand to hold the thermometer vertically and insulate the beaker with alfoil.<br>
Continue recording until the water has been boiling fir two minutes.<br>
During a change of state. added energy breaks the bonds between particles, increaing their potential energy, on the way to a change in state.<br>

 Make a capillary tube by drawing out a glass tube over a hot flame.<br>
 Put a very small amount of naphthalene in a capillary tube sealed at one end.<br>
 Attach a thermometer to the capillary tube, a sealed end down.<br>
 Put the thermometer and capillary tube in a container of water and slowly heat the water while stirring with the thermometer and capillary tube.<br>

 Leave it to stand for 5 minutes and note the liquid level.<br>
 The drop in water level is not, because water is absorbed by the salt.<br>
 Pour out some water before all the salt dissolves and refill it with fresh water.<br>
 The water level drops again, because the crystals of the dissolving salt breaks down into ions that can slip in between the water molecules and make the total volume decrease.<br>

 Add water until the measuring cylinder is exactly full.<br>
 After a few minutes, note that as the sodium chloride dissolves, the liquid level drops.<br>
 2. Repeat the experiment using sucrose crystals instead of sodium chloride crystals.<br>
 The water level does not drop, because the sugar molecule is larger than water molecules and does not form ions.<br>
 The sucrose crystals dissolve to form sucrose molecules that are much bigger than the sodium ions or chloride ions.<br>
 3. Half fill a test-tube with water.<br>
 While holding this test-tube at an angle, pour ethanol slowly from a beaker until the test-tube is full.<br>
 Hold the test-tube by placing your thumb on the mouth of the tube so that no air bubble is trapped.<br>
 The test-tube seems full.<br>
 Invert the test-tube several times while keeping a thumb on the opening.<br>
 Do not release the pressure.<br>
 The liquid level becomes lower.<br>
 The alcohol or water did not evaporate and no liquid spilt, because of inverting the test-tube.<br>
 By inverting the test-tube, mixing of water and alcohol occurs, and the alcohol molecules slip between the water molecules in the spaces between the molecules, thus making the total volume of the mixture become less.<br>
 The spaces between the molecules cannot be seen by the naked eye.<br>
 4. Repeat the experiment with methanol or rubbing alcohol (isopropanol).<br>
 Not all combinations of liquids give the strange shrinking illusion, but many water / alcohol mixtures do.<br>

 Observe the colour change as the food colourings mix and note the final total level of the solution.<br>
 Use a pipette to bring the solution up to the total volume of the smaller measuring cylinders.<br>
 Calculate the % shrinkage, about 2 vols 1 / vol 2 = 1.9.<br>

Heated hydrated salts may first lose their water of crystallization, and then become stable anhydrous powders.<br>
In doing so, they lose their former crystalline shape and may lose their colour.<br>
Experiments<br>
 Prepare test-tubes containing 1 cm of 1. iodine crystals 2. sodium hydrogen carbonate granules or crystals 3. silica sand 4. zinc oxide.<br>
 Fix a cotton wool plug in the mouth of each test-tube to prevent loss of solid during heating, then weigh each test-tube.<br>
 Heat each test-tube and cotton wool plug thoroughly and weigh it again.<br>
 Note any change in weight, because of the loss of water of crystallization.<br>

1. If it takes 54 mL of 0.10 M NaOH to neutralize 125 mL of an HCl solution, what is the concentration of the HCl?<br>
2. If it takes 25 mL of 0.050 M HCl to neutralize 345 mL of NaOH solution, what is the concentration of the NaOH solution?<br>
3. If it takes 50.0 mL of 0.50 M KOH solution to completely neutralize 125 mL of sulfuric acid solution (H2SO4), what is the concentration of the H2SO4 solution?<br>
4) Can I titrate a solution of unknown concentration with another solution of unknown concentration and still get a meaningful answer?<br> 
5) Explain the difference between an endpoint and equivalence point in a titration.<br> 
Answers<br>
For questions 1 and 2, the units for your final answer should be “M”, or “molar”, because you’re trying to find the molarity of the acid or base solution. 
To solve these problems, use M1V1 = M2V2.<br>
1. 0.043 M HCl<br>
2. 0.0036 M NaOH<br>
3. 0.10 M H2SO4<br>
In 3, the final answer is divided by two, because H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so there are two acidic hydrogens to be neutralized during the titration.<br> 
As a result, it takes twice as much base to neutralize it, making the concentration of the acid appear twice as large as it really is.<br>
4. A titration cannot be done without knowing the molarity of at least one of the substances, because an equation cannot be done with two unknowns, M1 and M2.<br>
5. Endpoint: When you actually stop doing the titration (usually, this is determined by a color change in an indicator or an indication of pH=7.0 on an electronic pH probe.<br>
Equivalence point: When the solution is exactly neutralized.<br>
The equivalence point and the endpoint are not exactly the same because indicators don’t change color at exactly 7.0000 pH and pH probes aren’t infinitely accurate.<br> 
However, the effectiveness of a titration can be measured by the closeness of the endpoint to the equivalence point.<br>

 Carbon dioxide is an acidic oxide that dissolves in water to form the weak acid carbonic acid (H2CO3), pH about 4, and the carbonate ion.<br>
 H2O (l) + CO2 (g) &lt;--> H2CO3 (aq)<br>
 Carbonation is the dissolving of carbon dioxide in water under pressure to become effervescent, fizzy.<br>
 Do not store carbonic acid, because it easily decomposes to carbon dioxide and water.<br>
 Soda water is carbon dioxide dissolved in water under pressure that makes the gas more soluble.<br>
 Carbonic acid is the basis for all aerated waters, e.g. fizzy lemonade or cola, gaseous natural spring waters and sparkling wines.<br>
 If a glass of cold fizzy drink is left on the table, as the temperature of the drink increases, carbon dioxide is lost from the drink as bubbles of carbon dioxide escape, effervescence, and the drink becomes "flat".<br>
 Carbonic acid soon decomposes, but it can form stable sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate and hydrogencarbonate salts.<br>

 Carbon dioxide and other gases that could accumulate in coal mines to cause choking and suffocation were called choke-damp, after-damp, foul-damp, black damp.<br>
 Miners used to keep a caged canary bird with them that would die before a concentration of carbon dioxide fatal to humans occurred.<br>
 Carbon dioxide is used in photosynthesis.<br>
 Excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from excess burning of fossil fuels causes a greenhouse effect so the temperature of the atmosphere rises, called global warming.<br>
 An increase of the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere may increase the rate of photosynthesis.<br>
 At standard temperature and pressure, the density of carbon dioxide is approximately 1.98 kg / m 3, i.e., about 1.5 X the density of air.<br>
 Carbon dioxide is not liquid at pressures below 5.1 standard atmospheres, 520 kPa.<br>
 At 1 atmosphere, approximately mean sea level pressure, the gas precipitates directly as a solid at temperatures below -78.5 C, and the solid sublimes directly to a gas above -78.5 C.<br>
 Liquid carbon dioxide forms only at pressures above 5.1 atm.<br>
 The triple point of carbon dioxide is approximately 518 kPa at -56.6 C.<br>
 The critical point above which distinct liquid and gas phases do not exist is 7.38 MPa at 31.1 o C.<br>

 Attach a small piece of magnesium ribbon to the end of a wire.<br>
 Light the magnesium ribbon and put it quickly into a test-tube of carbon dioxide.<br>
 The magnesium continues to burn with a spluttering reaction.<br>
 White magnesium oxide and specks of black carbon form.<br>
 The magnesium reduces the carbon dioxide to carbon.<br>
 If you see no carbon specks, add sulfuric acid to remove the magnesium oxide and unburned magnesium so that the carbon becomes more visible.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.1.2H">3.1.2</a> Frozen carbon dioxide, ("dry ice", "hot ice" "cardice")<br>
Solid state carbon dioxide is commonly called "dry ice" and is used by travelling ice cream sellers.<br>
 <b> Be careful! </b>When handling dry ice in the laboratory, wear eye protection and wear gloves to avoid frostbite.<br>
 Store dry ice in an expanded polystyrene box.<br>
 If dry ice is touched, the moisture on the skin freezes and the dry ice sticks to the skin, causing frostbite.<br>
 When carbon dioxide is cooled under pressure, it becomes a solid.<br>
 Dry ice is used as a refrigerant by mobile ice cream sellers, in fire extinguishers, and for stage effects to produce artificial smoke or mist.<br>
 At atmospheric pressure dry ice sublimes at -78.5 o C.<br>
 The temperature of dry ice is always &lt; 78.5 o C at atmospheric pressure, whatever the air temperature.<br>
 When heated, it changes directly from solid to gas, sublimes.<br>
Experiments<br>
1. <b>Be careful!</b> DO NOT LICK DRY ICE, because your tongue will stick to it!<br>
 Purchase dry ice from an ice cream stand.<br>
 Hold it in a gloved hand.<br>
 Watch it disappear as the carbon dioxide sublimes.<br>
2. Dry ice in water<br>
 Fill a 10 cc measuring cylinder water and add universal indicator.<br>
 Add drops of sodium hydroxide solution.<br>
 Add a lump dry ice.<br>
 Note how the dry ice sinks to the bottom and gives off bubbles of carbon dioxide to make a fog at the mouth of the measuring cylinder.<br>
 The universal indicator slowly changes colour from blue, pH 9, to orange, pH 5, as the pH reaches about 4.5.<br>
 OH - (aq) + CO2 (g) &gt; HCO3 - (aq)<br>
 Repeat the experiment with ammonia solution.<br>
 The colour change of the universal indicator is more gradual, because of the reaction of weak acids with weak bases.<br>

 1. Compare the weight of carbon dioxide and air<br>
 Put two identical plastic bags on each pan of a scale or attach them to each arm of a simple beam balance.<br>
 The plastic bags should be open upwards and must balance perfectly.<br>
 Prepare carbon dioxide by adding vinegar to sodium bicarbonate in a beaker.<br>
 Hold the beaker above one of the plastic bags and pour the invisible carbon dioxide into the bag without pouring out any froth or chemicals.<br>
 The plastic bag containing the carbon dioxide sinks down showing that carbon dioxide is heavier than air.<br>
 The density of carbon dioxide is about 1.98 g per litre, which is about 1.5 × as heavy as air.<br>
 The fact that you can pour the carbon dioxide into the plastic bag shows that it is heavier than air.<br>
 2. Weight of carbon dioxide<br>
 Attach a drawing pin, sharp side up, to the corner of a flat table.<br>
 Attach a small plastic bag to each end of a wooden ruler.<br>
 Suspend the centre of the ruler with attached plastic bags over the point 
 of the drawing pin so that the ruler balances horizontally.<br>
 Add vinegar to powdered sodium hydrogencarbonate in a small beaker.<br>
 Pout the gas above the mixture into on of the plastic bags.<br>
 This bag sinks, because of the weight of the transferred carbon dioxide gas.<br>

 The limewater will turn milky indicating that the carbon dioxide has fallen into the lower jar, because it is the heavier gas.<br>
 2. Repeat the experiment with the carbon dioxide in the lower jar and invert a jar of air on top of it.<br>
 If the jars are left for 5 minutes carbon dioxide will be carried into the upper jar by diffusion, in the same way air will be carried into the lower jar.<br>

1. Vinegar contains up to 8% acetic acid.
Mothballs consist of naphthalene, which is flammable, so newer mothballs contain other chemicals that are not flammable
Mix vinegar with bicarbonate of soda in a glass jar.<br>
 Drop some naphthalene mothballs into the solution.<br>
 The carbon dioxide formed by the reaction of the vinegar (acetic acid) with the sodium hydrogencarbonate forms bubbles of carbon dioxide on the mothballs.<br>
 The mothballs rise to the surface, lose the bubbles and sink again, so this experiment may be called "dancing mothballs".
 NaHCO3 + CH3COOH --> CH3COONa + H2O + CO2 (g).<br>
2. Mix vinegar (acetic acid) with sodium hydrogencarbonate in a big container.<br>
 Drop naphthalene mothballs into the solution.<br>
 The carbon dioxide formed by the reaction of the vinegar with the sodium hydrogencarbonate forms bubbles of carbon dioxide within the rough surface of the mothballs at the bottom of the container.<br>
 When enough bubbles are attached to a mothball, it becomes less dense than the surrounding liquid and mothballs rises to the surface.<br>
 At the surface, the carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere, the mothball becomes more dense than the surrounding liquid and sinks again.<br>

 <b>Be careful!</b> The wire of an extinguished sparkler may still be very hot.<br>
 Arrange for extinguished sparklers to be dropped in a safe place, e.g. a container of sand.<br>
 Sparklers may be illegal in some countries and are not allowed in some school systems.<br>
 Use Plasticine to stick a small birthday candle to the bottom of a cut-off plastic drink bottle and light the candle.<br>
 Mix one teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda in half a cup of water.<br>
 Mix one teaspoon of cream of tartar (tartaric acid) in another half a cup of water.<br>
 Pour both solutions into the drink bottle, but not enough to cover the candle!.<br>
 Bubbles of carbon dioxide appear and then the candle goes out.<br>
 You cannot relight the candle with a lighted match, because of the carbon dioxide around the candle and carbon dioxide is heavier than air.<br>
 So the match goes out before you can light the candle.<br>
 Some people can blow a soap bubble with a bubble pipe and sit the bubble on top of the layer of carbon dioxide, but doing this is not easy.<br>
 Light the sparkler and hold the sparkling end in the drink bottle.<br>
 The sparkler does not go out, because the sparkles come from burning magnesium powder and magnesium reacts with carbon dioxide.<br>
 You can now relight the candle with a match, because all the carbon dioxide has reacted with the magnesium in the sparkler and oxygen has returned to the cut-off drink bottle.<br>
 Have a dish of sand nearby to take the hot end of the sparkler.<br>
 Teachers refuse to do this experiment with some classes, because undisciplined children may burn themselves or children, or leave the hot sparkler on the desk.<br>

 Washing soda (sodium carbonate decahydrate, Na2CO3.10H2O), allows sodium ions to displace calcium ions in clay particles so that clay particles in mud can be dispersed and held in suspension in the 
 washing water.<br>
 Baking soda (sodium hydrogencarbonate, bicarbonate of soda, baking powder), is used in cooking to form bubbles of carbon dioxide to expand bread dough, cake mix and pastry dough, to make them 
light and pleasant to eat.<br>
 Baking powders often contain a solid acid that reacts with the sodium hydrogencarbonate only when moist.<br>
 Baking powder contains sodium hydrogencarbonate (sodium bicarbonate), which reacts with an acid, e.g. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, (lactic acid), from sour milk, to form carbon dioxide.<br>
 The heat from the oven helps the decomposition of sodium hydrogencarbonate to form carbon dioxide.<br>
 Yeast cells convert sugar to carbon dioxide gas and alcohol to make bread rise.<br>
 Baking powder, or sodium bicarbonate, NHCO3, reacts with an acid such as lactic acid from sour milk to produce carbon dioxide.<br>

 Cola-Mentos Fountain Kit<br>
Experiment<br>
 Put a candy, e.g. a spearmint candy, "Mentos", into a test-tube.<br>
 Add aerated water, e.g. cola, diet cola.<br>
 Observe the bubbles of carbon dioxide coming from the surface of the candy.<br>
 The grainy surface of the candy provides nucleation sites for the formation of carbon dioxide gas from carbon dioxide in the cola solution.<br>
 It snags small dissolved bubbles that coalesce to form large bubbles, which in turn coalesce to form gigantic bubbles that break off and move upwards like rockets, whooshing through any nozzle.<br>
 "Diet colas" usually works better than other colas, because they usually contain corn syrup that inhibits bubble formation.<br>
 <b>Be careful!</b> Too many Mentos tablets in a cola bottle may injure people from the resulting explosion!<br>
 The geyser effect is caused by the uncoloured, unglazed version of Mentos that provides nucleation sites for the dissolved carbon dioxide in the cola to escape as a gas.<br>
 Other active ingredients in the cascade effect reaction include the artificial sweetener, aspartame, the preservative, potassium benzoate, and caffeine in the diet cola.<br>
 Also, Mentos contains gum arabic and gelatin.<br>
 The ingredients add to the nucleation, to create a chemical reaction that forces the soda to release immediately all of its dissolved carbon dioxide, causing a more violent eruption than only carbonated water (soda 
 water).<br>
 By using a nozzle, the geyser can reach 9.1 m.<br>
 However, it may extend to 10 m by using rock salt, which is more porous and provides even more nucleation sites per unit area than Mentos.<br>

 The carbon dioxide level decreases during the day through the photosynthesis of green plants, and increases at night when these plant respire and release it.<br>
 So the blanketing effect on heat movement would increase at night impeding radiation of heat away from the surface of the earth and cause higher surface temperatures.<br>
 If the concentration of carbon dioxide was stable at all times it would impede as much incoming heat to the surface of the earth as outgoing heat.<br>
 When a cloud cover forms at the end of a clear day, it blankets the movement of heat from the lower atmosphere to the upper atmospheres so the night temperature does not drop as much as on a clear 
 night.<br>
 If the cloud cover is there in the day and the night sky is clear, the same clouds become the opposite of a greenhouse gas.<br>

2. Prepare limewater by adding calcium oxide (quicklime) to water to form calcium hydroxide.<br>
 CaO (s) + H2O (l)--> Ca(OH)2 (s)<br>
 calcium oxide + water--> calcium hydroxide<br>
 Then the calcium hydroxide dissolves in water to form a weak alkaline solution.<br>
 Limewater is a saturated solution of calcium hydroxide.<br>
 Ca(OH)2 (aq) &lt; = &gt; Ca 2+ (aq) + 2OH - (aq)<br>
When testing for the presence of carbon dioxide, make a fresh solution of limewater, otherwise the surface turns milky on standing, because of the reaction with

Store limewater in a container with a rubber or plastic stopper.<br>
If you use a screw top container, calcium carbonate may form in the screw of the lid, so you cannot open the container.<br>
3. Pass carbon dioxide through limewater or blow through it.<br>

 A fine suspension of calcium carbonate causes the milky colour in the Ca(OH)2 (s) + CO2 (g) --> CaCO3 (s) + H2O (l)<br>
 Pass more carbon dioxide through the solution.<br>
 The solution becomes clear again, because soluble calcium hydrogencarbonate forms.<br>
 CaCO3 (s) + CO2 (g) + H2O (l) --> Ca(HCO3)2 (aq)<br>
 The reaction can be reversed to form the calcium carbonate precipitate once again, either by boiling the solution or bubbling air through it.<br>

<a href="../images/9.157.gif">See diagram 9.157</a>: Production of carbon dioxide during plant respiration.<br>
 1. Plant respiration can only be observed where no photosynthetic activity occurs.<br>
 So use fungi or parts of plants that have no chlorophyll necessary for photosynthesis, e.g. mushrooms or the white flowers of the Compositae family, e.g. daisy.<br>
 Remove the green leaflets of the calyx to prevent photosynthesis.<br>
 Use the burning time of a candle in an enclosed known volume of air to prove the presence of oxygen.<br>
 Smear the bottom edge of a big jar with petroleum jelly then put it on a glass plate.<br>
 Open the neck of the jar then put a lighted candle down the neck on to the glass plate.<br>
 Be careful! Melting wax from a burning candle can cause severe skin burns so use safety glasses and insulated heat-proof gloves.<br>
 Close the neck of the jar immediately.<br>
 Record the burning time of the candle.<br>
 Put mushrooms or white flowers in the jar.<br>
 Close the neck of the jar.<br>
 Two hours later, put the lighted candle into the jar.<br>
 Record the burning time of the candle.<br>
 The candle burns a shorter time, because plants extract oxygen from the air during respiration.<br>
 2. Repeat the experiment by pumping air from the jar through limewater.<br>
 Continue pumping until the limewater becomes milky to show the presence of carbon dioxide.<br>

<a href="../images/3.2.39ch.gif">See diagram 3.2.39</a>: Yeast reacting with sugar solution.<br>
 1. Make a sugar solution and half fill a container with this solution.<br>
 Add a spoonful of dry yeast and leave to stand for two days.<br>
 Construct a bubbler to fit on the top of the container.<br>
 Note whether the yeast forms a gas.<br>
 Note whether carbon dioxide gas collects in the upper part of the container.<br>
 Yeast breaks down sugar into ethanol using enzymes that act as catalysts in the conversion:<br>
 C6H12O6 --> 2C2H5OH + 2CO2 (g)<br>
 glucose --> ethanol + carbon dioxide<br>
Soda bread is leavened with baking soda, not yeast<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.10.0H">3.10.0</a> Soft drinks, carbonated beverages, fizzy drinks, sports drinks<br>
Carbonation is the dissolving of CO2 in water under pressure to become effervescent, fizzy.<br>
A "soft drink" is a drink that contains no alcohol.<br>
A "soft drink" is a general term for a non-alcoholic drink, but in some countries it may contain < 0.5% by volume of alcohol, if more it is called a "hard drink".<br>
The US term "hard liquor" refers to distilled alcoholic drinks, e.g. whisky.<br>
Soft drinks are commonly called fizzy drinks, because of the effervescent carbon dioxide, or soda or pop, e.g. cola, ginger ale, lemonade.<br>
Soft drinks usually contain the following:<br>
1. carbonated water,<br>
2. a sweetener, e.g. sucrose, fructose, or an artificial sweetener, e.g. saccharin C7H5NO3S, sucralose C12H19Cl3O8, in diet drinks.<br>
3. flavouring, flavour enhancing agents<br>
Sports drinks, e.g. "Gatorade" and energy drinks, e.g. "Red Bull" may not be carbonated, but they are usually just soft drinks containing caffeine and perhaps other stimulants.<br>
Sports drinks contain high sugar content and electrolytes, and are designed to quench the thirst and rehydrate the body after exercise.<br>
Some sports drinks are used for oral rehydration therapy.<br>
They contain potassium, sodium, sugars, water, citric acid, citrus and food colouring to replaces electrolyte and fluid for ingestion after strenuous exercise.<br>
Also, sports drinks have been used to treat morning sickness, diarrhoea, heat exhaustion, and dehydration after vomiting.<br>
However, these conditions require proper medical attention, because high intake of sports drinks may cause obesity, dental caries and type-2 diabetes.<br>
The UK government is introducing a tax on drinks containing excess sugar and some manufacturers of soft drinks have reduced the sugar contents of their products.<br>
Energy drinks contain high sugar content and stimulants, usually caffeine.<br>
These drinks cause rapid increase in alertness, attention and energy, followed by drowsiness and a slump in attention, causing problems in school classrooms.<br>
Perhaps the combination of high sugar content with caffeine causes behavioural problems not associated with drinks containing only caffeine.<br>
Some countries have banned the sale of energy drinks to people under 18 years of age.<br>
