<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.1.1H">3.1.1</a> Boiling point of liquids<br>
Evaporation occurs only at the surface of liquids, but may occur at all temperatures.<br>
When boiling occurs, bubbles form inside the liquid and the liquid boils at a definite temperature, the boiling point depending on the pressure.<br>
When boiling occurs the temperature of the liquid remains constant until all the liquid has evaporated.<br>
The liquid boils when the saturation pressure is equal to the pressure acting on the surface of the liquid.<br>
Air bubbles form first as small nuclei increasing in size with temperature.<br>
When bubbles of vapour form in a boiling liquid, the vapour pressure of the gas in the bubbles is greater than atmospheric pressure.<br>
When the chemical bonds between liquid molecules are strong, only a few molecules can break the bonds to become a vapour.<br>
Smaller molecules usually have lower boiling points.<br>
The boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which the liquid boils when exposed to the atmosphere.<br>
So the boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which the vapour pressure of the liquid equals the pressure of the atmosphere, 1 atmosphere.<br>
At 100oC, the vapour pressure of pure water is one atmosphere (101.325 KPa, kNm-2).<br>
The boiling point varies with pressure, so water boils at <100oC on high mountains.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.1.2H">3.1.2</a> Boiling point of inflammable liquids<br>
<a href="../images/3.6x.gif">See diagram 3.6</a>: Boiling point of inflammable liquids.<br>
 A rubber band, B capillary tube, C test-tube, D inflammable liquid, E thermometer<br>
 1. Do not use a Bunsen burner to find the boiling point of inflammable liquids, e.g. ethanol (B P 78.4oC) and acetone (B P 56oC).<br>
 Use an electric hot plate or use the following method.<br>
 Pour 2 cm of the inflammable liquid into a test-tube in an empty container.<br>
 Place a thermometer in the test-tube with its bulb in the liquid.<br>
 Boil water in an electric jug or on an electrical hot plate.<br>
 Pour the hot water into the container so that the level is higher than the inflammable liquid in the test-tube.<br>
 Stir the inflammable liquid gently with the thermometer and read thermometer when the inflammable liquid boils.<br>
 It is not good practice to stir liquids with thermometers!<br>
2. Use a very small test-tube or seal one end of a piece of glass tubing, 8 cm length and 3 cm external diameter.<br>
 Put the inflammable liquid into this test-tube.<br>
 Put a capillary tube, sealed at one end, into the inflammable liquid with the sealed end up and the open end down in the inflammable liquid.<br>
 Use a rubber band to attach the test-tube containing inflammable and capillary tube to the bulb of a thermometer.<br>
 Hold the apparatus in a container of water and heat gently with an electric hot plate.<br>
 When the temperature rises, bubbles slowly come out of the capillary tube.<br>
 At the boiling point the bubbles suddenly come out as a steady stream.<br>
 Read the temperature.<br>
 Let the water cool and read the temperature again when the steady stream of bubbles stops.<br>
 Calculate the boiling point as the average of the two readings.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.1.3H">3.1.3</a> Boiling point of sodium chloride solution<br>
 1. A solution of sodium chloride in water boils at a higher temperature and has a lower freezing point than pure water.<br>
 Use freezing points and boiling points to find the purity of substances.<br>
 Use three test-tubes containing the same volume of water.<br>
 Add some sodium chloride to the second test-tube.<br>
 Keep adding sodium chloride to the third test-tube until no more dissolves to produce a saturated solution at that temperature.<br>
 Join the test-tubes with an elastic band.<br>
 Heat the test-tubes equally over a Bunsen burner.<br>
 The first test-tube containing only water boils first.<br>
 The second test-tube containing some sodium chloride boils next.<br>
 The third test-tube containing the saturated solution of sodium chloride boils last.<br>
 However, it is reported that the addition of 20 g of salt to 5 litres of water increases the boiling temperature to only 100.04oC.!<br>
 2. Put a beaker containing demineralized water in a broad pan containing a concentrated salt solution.<br>
 Slowly heat the broad pan and note that the demineralized water boils first.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.1.5H">3.1.5</a> Boiling point of water<br>
<a href="../images/3.5x.gif">See diagram 3.5</a>: Boiling point of water.<br>
 1. Pour water into a test-tube.<br>
 Hold a thermometer with its bulb just under the water.<br>
 Heat very slowly by moving the test-tube in and out of the flame or add boiling chips, anti-bumping granules.<br>
 Heat the water gently until it boils.<br>
 Record the temperature.<br>
 Note the same temperature in all parts of the test-tube.<br>
 Note any change in the reading if the thermometer touches the bottom of the test-tube.<br>
 The water must cover the bulb of the thermometer and the bulb must not touch the sides of the test-tube.<br>
 2. Show that the boiling point of water does not depend on the size of the container.<br>
 Repeat the experiment with a large container.<br>
 Heat the water quickly.<br>
 The water first starts to boil near the bottom and sides of the container.<br>
 Note the temperature in different parts of the container.<br>
 Note any change in the reading if the thermometer touches the bottom of the container.<br>
 The boiling point is the same in small and large containers.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.1.6H">3.1.6</a> Elevation of boiling points, ebullioscopy constant, kB<br>
 The boiling point of a liquid is raised if substances are dissolved in it.<br>
 The elevation is proportional to the number of particles or molecules or ions dissolved in the liquid.<br>
 The elevation in oC = the molal concentration of the solute in the liquid × a constant.<br>
 The value of the constant (ebullioscopy constant, kB) depends on the solvent.<br>
 So if kB is known, the molecular weight of the solute can be calculated.<br>
 Addition of substances to water used for cooking has little effect on cooking time, because adding a tablespoon (20 g), of sodium 
 chloride (common salt), to 5 litres of water increases the boiling point of pure water by only 0.04oC.<br>
 The presence of a solute both raises the boiling point and lowers the freezing point of the solvent.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.1.7H">3.1.7 </a> Leidenfrost effect, water drops on hot stove<br>
 An insulating layer of vapour may support liquids hotter than the liquid's boiling point.<br>
 Let drops of water fall on a very hot stove top.<br>
 The drops do not immediately evaporate or spread into a puddle, but jump around supported by a vapour layer below them caused by the high heat that evaporated some of the liquid.<br>
 The liquid floats on this vapour cushion and boils without bubbling.<br>
 If the hot surface suddenly cools, the vapour layer can collapse and the water bubbles explosively.<br>
 In chemical factories, there is a risk of explosion if water touches very hot metal, but this may be controlled if the metal has a rough texture.<br>
 Similarly, liquid nitrogen may mover erratically over the floor.<br>
 Foolish experimenters have demonstrated the Leidenfrost effect by dipping their fingers in molten lead with temperature &gt; 450oC<br>
 Do not try to demonstrate this molten lead experiment in the laboratory!<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.1.8H">3.1.8</a> Volatility of different liquids, perfume<br>
 Evaporation is the movement of particles from the surface of a liquid to the gas state, when below the boiling point.<br>
 Volatile liquids evaporate readily at room temperatures.<br>
 1. Select liquids from the laboratory, e.g. water, methylated spirits, gasoline, mineral turpentine, kerosene (paraffin oil), household oil, machine oil, car oil, vinegar, vanilla essence, eucalyptus oil, glycerine.<br>
 Wet a 5 cm piece of absorbent paper with a liquid.<br>
 Write the name of the test liquid in pencil.<br>
 Attach the piece of paper to a horizontal string.<br>
 Examine the paper every ten minutes, every two hours, and each day.<br>
 2. Repeat the experiment with perfumes.<br>
 Smell the paper every ten minutes, every two hours and each day.<br>
 Some perfumes soon disappear, but others last for days.<br>
 Record the relative "person-attracting" capacity for each perfume!<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.2.1H">3.2.1</a> Heat substances that decompose and lose mass when heated<br>
<a href="../images/3.30x.gif">See diagram 3.30</a>: Heat copper sulfate crystals.<br>
 The phrase "Substances that do not decompose when heated" refers to substances that remain stable after heating constantly with a Bunsen burner flame.<br>
 However, all compounds breakdown when heated to a high enough temperature.<br>
 1. Most carbonates decompose to form carbon dioxide and a metallic oxide.<br>
 Sodium hydrogen carbonate, NaHCO3 (sodium bicarbonate), begins to lose carbon dioxide at 50oC to form sodium carbonate.<br>
 A solution of a sodium hydrogen carbonate begins to lose carbon dioxide at 20oC.<br>
 2. Hydroxides decompose to form water and a metallic oxide.<br>
 3. Nitrates decompose to form oxygen, nitrogen dioxide and a metallic oxide, except potassium nitrate and sodium nitrate that form 
 the nitrite and oxygen.<br>
 Lead nitrate decomposes at 470oC.<br>
 4. Nearly all oxides are stable, e.g. zinc oxide, ZnO, M P above 1, 800oC.<br>
 5. Some sulfates decompose to form sulfur trioxide and metallic oxide.<br>
 6. Metal compounds higher in the activity series are usually more stable 
 than compounds of metals lower in the activity series.<br>
 7. Some salts first lose water of crystallization and then become stable.<br>
 8. The salts that remain stable when heated constantly with a Bunsen burner flame are calcium sulfate, potassium chloride, potassium sulfate, sodium carbonate, sodium chloride, and sodium sulfate.<br>
 Ammonium oxalate (NH4COO)2, and ammonium dichromate (NH4)2Cr2O7, decompose before melting.<br>
 Ammonium sulfate (NH4)2SO4, decomposes above 280oC.<br>
 9. Boric acid, H3BO3, loses water until it decomposes to the anhydride, B2O3.<br>
 10. Oxalic acid begins to sublime at 100oC, becomes anhydrous at 189oC and when heated rapidly decomposes into carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, formic acid and water.<br>
 11. Potassium chlorate, KClO3, decomposes above 368oC into potassium perchlorate and oxygen.<br>
 Potassium ferricyanide, K2Fe(CN)6, decomposesbefore melting.<br>
 12. Monosodium orthophosphate, NaH2PO4.H2O, and disodium orthophosphate (disodium hydrogen phosphate (V), Na2HPO4.12H2O, lose water of crystallization.<br>
Experiments<br>
 1. Heat copper sulfate crystals.<br>
 Put 4 cm of crushed blue copper (II) sulfate crystals in a dry test-tube fitted with a one-hole stopper and delivery tube.<br>
 Heat the dry test-tube and crystals gently.<br>
 Note whether vapour collects on the cooler parts of the dry test-tube and whether any liquid collects in the receiving test-tube.<br>
 Observe any change of colour of the crystals from blue to white.<br>
 Identity the liquid in the receiving test-tube by measuring the boiling point.<br>
 When all the copper (II) sulfate crystals have become white and the dry test-tube has cooled, pour the liquid in the receiving test-tube back on the white crystals.<br>
 Note whether the blue colour of the crystals is restored and if any heat is given off.<br>
 (blue) copper (II) sulfate crystals + heat &lt; = &gt; (white) anhydrous copper (II) sulfate + water.<br>
 2. Prepare test-tubes containing 1 cm of (a) iodine crystals (b) sodium hydrogen carbonate granules or crystals (c) silica sand (d) zinc oxide.<br>
 Fix a cotton wool plug in the mouth of each test-tube to prevent loss of solid during heating, then weigh each test-tube.<br>
 Heat each test-tube and cotton wool plug thoroughly and weigh it again.<br>
 Note any change in weight, because of the loss of water of crystallization.<br>
 3. Put black, shiny crystals of iodine in an evaporating dish.<br>
 Cover the dish with a piece of filter paper and stand a filter funnel upside down on the dish.<br>
 Heat the dish gently.<br>
 Purple vapours rise through the filter paper.<br>
 As they cool in the filter funnel, shiny black crystals of iodine form again.<br>
 4. Heat sodium hydrogen carbonate crystals.<br>
 The crystals lose water and carbon dioxide, and at 100oC are converted to sodium carbonate.<br>
 5. Silica sand consists of pieces of silicon (IV) oxide (SiO2) crystals.<br>
 Heat sand in a crucible.<br>
 The sand particles may break up physically, but do not break up chemically.<br>
 6. Heat zinc oxide in a crucible.<br>
 The colour changes from white to yellow, but no change in weight occurs.<br>
 The substance does not decompose and does not gain anything from the air or lose anything to the air.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.3.1H">3.3.1</a> Ice melts, de-icers<br>
 1. Calcium chloride, can melts ice down to -31.7oC, and gives off heat as it dissolves to melt the ice quicker than other de-icers, but leaves a slimy residue, corrosive to metal, damages vegetation if over-application.<br>
 2. Magnesium chloride is less corrosive and safer on concrete and plants, fast-acting and more effective at de-icing than rock salt, over-application can damage plants
and keep pavement wet. 
 3. Sodium chloride, rock salt, least expensive and very efficient, melts ice down to -6.7oC, dries icy surfaces, not harmful to concrete, but damages vegetation, corrosive to metal and may leach into soil and contaminate groundwater.<br>
 However, saltwater freezes at -18oC, so salt is an ineffective de-icer below this temperature.<br>
 4. Potassium chloride, more expensive than other ice melt products, but works well as 50/50 with rock salt.<br>
 It can melt ice down to -25oC, but can cause plant injury.<br>
 5. Urea, melts ice to -9oC, but may harm vegetation with excess nitrogen or may add useful nitrogen fertilizer to plants, frequently used by gardeners, but
potential of runoff into water sources.<br> 
 6. Calcium magnesium acetate, [CaMg2(CH3COO)6], (CMA), from dolomite limestone and acetic acid, not effective below -6.7oC, only slight affect on plants and concrete, does not form a brine-like salts, prevents snow particles from sticking together on road surface, prevents re-freezing and leave a slush.<br>
 When the freezing point of water is lowered by creating a brine, freeze/thaw cycles and expansion of freezing water can damage concrete.<br>
 However, calcium magnesium acetate has relatively few environmental impacts, because it readily biodegrades and does not persist in the environment.<br>
7. Potassium acetate is a high-performing de-icer, which is biodegradable and non-corrosive.<br>
8. Beet Juice is quicker and less toxic for melting ice on roads and it has less of an impact on the environment, because it is a natural material.<br>
It can lower the melting point of water to -29oC.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.3.2H">3.3.2</a> Impurities affect the melting point of a substance<br>
 Mix stearic acid with the naphthalene to make the naphthalene impure.<br>
 Note changes in the melting point.<br>
 Impurities lower the melting point.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.3.3H">3.3.3</a> Melting point, MP, of solids<br>
"<i>DigiMelt</i> is a modern, low cost, digital melting point apparatus designed specifically for the student lab.", (Commercial)<br>
 The melting point (MP or fusing point), is the temperature at which a solid starts to liquefy.<br>
 The melting point and freezing point of a pure substance are the same temperature.<br>
 Melting (fusion), is the "solid to liquid" type of phase change.<br>
 Other phase changes include change from liquid to solid (freezing), solid to gas (sublimation), liquid to gas (evaporation), gas to liquid (condensation).<br>
 Pure substances melt at constant temperature.<br>
 Impurities lower the melting point.<br>
 Impure substances, e.g. alloys, melt over a range of temperature.<br>
 The melting point graph for a pure substance is horizontal as the solid melts.<br>
 The melting point graph for an impure substance has an inclined line as the solid melts.<br>
 Melting points and melting behaviours can be used to identify a substance and decide if it is pure.<br>
 Melting is also called fusion and the melting point can be called the fusing point.<br>
 The melting point of glass is 1400-1600oC, depending on the composition of the glass.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.3.4H">3.3.4</a> Melting point and cooling curve of stearic acid<br>
<a href="../images/3.2.2ch.gif">See diagram 3.2.2</a>: Melting point and cooling curve of stearic acid<br>
 Stearic acid melts at 69oC.<br>
 Stearic acid (octadecanoic acid), is a safer alternative to using naphthalene for the following experiments:<br>
 1. Put 2 cm of the acid in a test-tube with a thermometer.<br>
 Put the test-tube in a beaker containing water.<br>
 Heat the beaker tube gently until the acid just melts.<br>
 Note the time and remove the test-tube from the beaker.<br>
 Note the temperature every 30 seconds as the substance cools.<br>
 The acid solidifies again at the same temperature.<br>
 Heat the test-tube again to free thermometer.<br>
 Draw the cooling curve of the acid.<br>
 Plot temperature on the vertical axis and time on the horizontal axis.<br>
 When the acid is changing from liquid to solid, the curve is horizontal.<br>
 2. For a more accurate method to measure melting points, heat one end of a 10 cm capillary tube to seal it and put octadecanoic acid in the capillary tube.<br>
 Attach the capillary tube to a thermometer with a rubber band.<br>
 Put thermometer in a beaker of water.<br>
 Heat the water while stirring with thermometer.<br>
 Record the temperature at which the acid melts.<br>
 Leave the capillary tube to cool.<br>
 Record the temperature at which the acid solidifies.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.3.6H">3.3.6</a> Melting point and pressure<br>
<a href="../images/24.1.3.gif">See diagram 24.1.3</a>: Melting point and pressure.<br>
<a href="../images/24.1.3a.gif">See diagram 24.1.3a</a>: Regelation.<br>
Regelation is when ice melts under pressure and refreezing when pressure is reduced.<br>
Increase of pressure increases the freezing point of substances, but increase of pressure on substances that expand on freezing lowers the freezing point.<br>
So increased pressure on ice turns it to liquid, but when increased pressure stops the ice freezes again without change in temperature, regelation.<br>
Experiments<br>
1. Regelation<br>
Cut through a block of ice with a copper wire loop that has a heavy mass hanging from each end.<br>
Copper wire cuts through faster than iron or cotton thread.<br>
At the start of the experiment the copper wire should be the same temperature as the ice, otherwise it is just transferring heat and melting the ice.<br>
When the copper wire exerts pressure on the ice below it the ice melts, because its melting point is now lower.<br>
The ice under pressure is still at 0oC, which is above its melting point.<br>
So the wire sinks down through the melt water.<br>
However, above the wire the pressure decreases to near atmospheric pressure.<br>
The melt water still at 0oC refreezes. because the melting point is again 0oC.<br>
The refreezing water above the wire loses latent heat of fusion, which is conducted down to the copper wire and increases the melting process.<br>
The copper wire keeps passing down through the whole block of ice, cutting it on two and joining the cut regions together again.<br>
2. When you apply pressure to ice, you lower the freezing point of it.<br>
Freeze a rectangular ice cube in a freezer.<br>
Put it on a wooden board.<br>
Tie 500 g weights to each end of a thin nylon thread.<br>
Spread the thread across the upper surface of the ice and hang the weights at each side.<br>
Observe the ice melting below the thread as it cuts slowly into the ice.<br>
If the temperature is low enough, as the ice freezes the ice above the thread can freeze again, regelation.<br>
Then you can lift the ice cube by nylon thread.<br>
Substances that expand on freezing show a lowering melting point under pressure.<br>
3. Tie the ends of a 50 cm length of iron wire or nylon cord to two 10 cm lengths of cut broomstick to act as handles.<br>
 Lean over a block of ice, grip the handles and use them to push the wire or cord down onto it.<br>
 Move the wire from side to side and with a downward motion, as if you are sawing on the ice.<br>
 Eventually you can move the wired or cord down through the whole block of ice, but it remains as one block of ice.<br>
4. Push your finger down on the middle of an ice cube.<br>
Some ice at the upper surface melts, because of the increased temperature and pressure.<br>
Sprinkle salt on the ice cube and press it again.<br>
The ice cube melts slower. because salt lowers the melting point of ice.<br>
5. Squeeze crushed ice in a thick walled cylinder to form a solid block.<br>
In a snowball fight, throw loose snow only.<br>
If you squeeze the snow in your gloved hand, you create a rocky piece of ice that is dangerous to throw.<br>
6. The ice under a skaters ice skates quickly melts under the skate then refreezes again when the skater has passed.<br>
However, some people claim that pressure from ice skates is not enough to melt ice, except when the temperature is a fraction of a degree below 0oC.<br>
Skates move easily over ice, because a very thin layer of water already on the ice lowers the friction, and melting from frictional heating give more water lubricant.<br>

 "Ice Melting Blocks", endothermic heat flow (toy product).<br>
 For pure substances, the melting point (MP) = freezing point (FP).<br>
The melting point of ice at 1 atmosphere of pressure is 0°C (32 °F; 273 K ) = the freezing point of water.<br>
 For water, MP and FP = 0oC.<br>
 However, freezing mixtures of ice and salt have temperatures below 0oC.<br>
 The freezing point of water in motor car radiators is lowered by adding antifreeze solutions, e.g. ethylene glycol (ethane-1,2-diol), that does not freeze above -20.6o.<br>
 Freezing points can be used for detecting water in milk or other adulteration.<br>
 2. Use a refrigerator with the temperature in the freezer about -5oC.<br>
 Cover a 250 mL beaker with insulating material, half fill it with water and add small pieces of ice.<br>
 After 10 minutes, record the temperature of mixture of water and ice with a thermometer.<br>
 Take out some water from the beaker, add smaller pieces of ice just taken from the freezer.<br>
 Add layers of ice and salt until they half fill the beaker.<br>
 Put a test-tube with half full of water into the beaker so that it becomes surrounded by ice.<br>
 Put a thermometer in the test-tube.<br>
 Compare the melting temperature of ice in the beaker with the freezing temperature of water in the test-tube.<br>
 Let the ice in the beaker melt completely and let the water in the tube freeze to ice completely.<br>
 The readings of the two thermometers both reach the same value below 0oC.<br>
 Observe the liquid water and solid water exist together.<br>

 Leave it to stand for 5 minutes and note the liquid level.<br>
 The drop in water level is not, because water is absorbed by the salt.<br>
 Pour out some water before all the salt dissolves and refill it with fresh water.<br>
 The water level drops again, because the crystals of the dissolving salt breaks down into ions that can slip in between the water molecules and make the total volume decrease.<br>

 Add water until the measuring cylinder is exactly full.<br>
 After a few minutes, note that as the sodium chloride dissolves, the liquid level drops.<br>
 2. Repeat the experiment using sucrose crystals instead of sodium chloride crystals.<br>
 The water level does not drop, because the sugar molecule is larger than water molecules and does not form ions.<br>
 The sucrose crystals dissolve to form sucrose molecules that are much bigger than the sodium ions or chloride ions.<br>
 3. Half fill a test-tube with water.<br>
 While holding this test-tube at an angle, pour ethanol slowly from a beaker until the test-tube is full.<br>
 Hold the test-tube by placing your thumb on the mouth of the tube so that no air bubble is trapped.<br>
 The test-tube seems full.<br>
 Invert the test-tube several times while keeping a thumb on the opening.<br>
 Do not release the pressure.<br>
 The liquid level becomes lower.<br>
 The alcohol or water did not evaporate and no liquid spilt, because of inverting the test-tube.<br>
 By inverting the test-tube, mixing of water and alcohol occurs, and the alcohol molecules slip between the water molecules in the spaces between the molecules, thus making the total volume of the mixture become less.<br>
 The spaces between the molecules cannot be seen by the naked eye.<br>
 4. Repeat the experiment with methanol or rubbing alcohol (isopropanol).<br>
 Not all combinations of liquids give the strange shrinking illusion, but many water / alcohol mixtures do.<br>

 Observe the colour change as the food colourings mix and note the final total level of the solution.<br>
 Use a pipette to bring the solution up to the total volume of the smaller measuring cylinders.<br>
 Calculate the % shrinkage, about 2 vols 1 / vol 2 = 1.9.<br>

 In this website, the word "solution" refers to substances dissolved in water, i.e. aqueous solutions.<br>
 A solvent is a liquid that dissolves another substance, the solute, to form a solution.<br>
 The three ways to increase the rate at which a solid dissolves in water are as follows:<br>
 1. grinding the solid until finely divided,<br>
 2. shaking the solution while the solid is dissolving, and<br>
 3. heating the solution.<br>
