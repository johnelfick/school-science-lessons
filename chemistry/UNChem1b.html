Ammonia anhydrous, NH3, ammonia liquefied gas, ammonia gas<br>
Ammonia, aqueous 28% to 30%, aqueous ammonia, aqua ammonia, ammonia water<br>
"Ammonia (total)"' refers to the mixture of ammonia, NH3, and the ionized form (NH4<sup>+</sup>).<br>
Ammonia is less dense than air, 0.769 kg/m3 at STP, so it lighter than air, but vapours from a leak initially hug the ground.<br>
Ammonia solution is a weak electrolyte, so the properties of the molecules and the ions in the solution affect its properties.<br>
The (NH3) compound is the volatile, potentially hazardous, substance present in the mixture.<br>
 Ammonia is a colourless gas with a distinct, pungent odour that is distinctive of drying urine.<br>
 Ammonia is easily liquefied under pressure.<br>
 Ammonia is alkaline and is corrosive to copper.<br>
 Ammonia reacts strongly with oxidizers, acids, halogens, and attacks copper, aluminium, silver, zinc and their alloys, and some plastics.<br>
 Ammonia is very soluble in water, chloroform and ether, soluble in alcohol and is a good solvent.<br>
 Ammonia is toxic if at high levels with increased pH to animals, birds, and fish caused by the (NH3).<br>
 Ammonia is formed naturally by the decomposition of urine and manure.<br>
 Ammonia is an invisible, extremely irritating gas with a choking smell and is flammable in the presence of sufficient oxygen.<br>
 Do not prepare ammonia in an open room, but use a fume cupboard.<br>
Ammonia is extremely irritating to the nose and lungs.<br>
 Ammonia absorbs impurities on charcoal<br>

<a name="3.9.0H">3.9.0</a> Uses of ammonia<br>
* Ammonia is used in household and industrial cleaners, bleaching agents and disinfectants
* Ammonia is used in the preparation of synthetic fibres, e.g. nylons), plastics and explosives, resins, medicines, fertilizers, fuel cells and in refrigeration.<br>
* Ammonia is used in smelling salts, household and industrial cleaners, and window-cleaners
* Ammonia is used as a fertilizer, as a refrigerant, and in the manufacture of other chemicals.<br>
*  Household use of ammonia solution, in the soapy wash water, to loosen dirt, add whiteness and prevent shine, remove burnt food in aluminium pans, 
clean tops of stoves, remove fruit juice stains.<br>
* Ammonia is used in tests for aldehydes, Tollens' test, <a href="UNBiol6.html#9.8.4H">9.8.4</a> (ammonia solution)<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="3.2.0H">3.2.0</a> Ammonia gas, NH3, ammonium ion, NH4+<br>
Ammonia is a colorless gas with a pungent odour, said to smell like decaying fish.<br>
Ammonia occurs naturally in the environment, and bacteria in the human intestine produce ammonia.<br>
Hot ammonia gas is a reducing agent, e.g. hot black copper oxide is reduced to copper by a stream of hot ammonia.<br>
Ammonia forms complex ions with metallic ions, e.g. cuprammonium sulfate, (IUPAC Tetraamminecopper(II) sulfate monohydrate), [Cu(NH3)4]SO4·H2O.<br>
Ammonia dissolves in water to produce clear colourless ammonia solution, liquid ammonia, aqueous ammonia, NH3 (aq), ("ammonium hydroxide"), 
which is mainly undissociated, but contains enough hydroxyl ions to behave as a weak alkali.<br>
NH3 + H2O --> NH<sup>+</sup><sub>4</sub> + OH<sup>−</sup><br>
ammonia + water --> ammonia solution<br>
The reaction does not form [NH+4][OH−]<br>
Ammonia solution is a very weak acid.<br>
The ammonium ion, NH4<sup>+</sup>, is stable and has a metallic character.<br>
When heated with a high concentration of hydroxyl ions, the ammonium ion forms ammonia gas.<br>
NH4<sup>+</sup> + OH<sup>-</sup> --> NH3 (g) + H2O<br>
By hydrolysis, ammonium salts may react acidic.<br>
NH4<sup>+</sup> + H2O --> NH4OH +H<sup>+</sup><br>
Ammonium salts sublime when heated.<br>
Ammonia can be deprotonated in non-aqueous solutions to give the amide ion NH2-, and you can buy sodium amide.<br>
2Na + 2NH3 --> 2NaNH2 + H2<br>
sodium + ammonia --> sodium amide + hydrogen<br>
Sodium amidem sodamide, sodium azanide is used as an organic chemistrystrong base, e.g for production of indigo dye for blue jeans, C16H10N2O2.<br>

Ammonia solution
Ammonia solution, ammonium hydroxide, (NH3), (weak ammonia, about 10%, is sold as a household cleaner)<br>
Ammonia solution is a weak electrolyte so the properties of the molecules and the ions in the solution affect its properties.<br>
Concentrated ammonia solution forms ammonia gas whenever the container holding it is opened.<br>
Ammonia solution<br>
 If ammonia solution is spilt in a fume cupboard, evacuate the area until the ammonia fumes have dispersed.<br>
 Do not allow ammonia solution to contact the skin.<br>
 Do not add concentrated ammonia solution to solid iodine, because a black solid, called touch powder, (NI3NH3) forms, and, if dry, the slightest friction causes it to explode.<br>
 Do not add concentrated ammonia solution to bleach or bleaching powder, because nitrogen trichloride, (NCl3), may form, a violently unstable liquid that may explode.<br>
 Common name: Household ammonia, 10% solution, ammonium hydroxide, (NH4OH), is a strong solution of the gas used for cleaning.<br>
 Common name: Strong ammonia is a 27% solution.<br>
Ammonia solution is used for neutralizing acids and for precipitating hydroxides of metals, usually as jelly-like precipitates, formed when ammonia is added to solutions of soluble compounds of the metals, 
e.g. alum (aluminium potassium sulfate), iron alum, (iron (III) ammonium sulfate), magnesium sulfate, and zinc sulfate.<br>
Household ammonia is far too strong for most school experiments, so prepare a dilute solution by adding about five parts of water to one part of household ammonia.<br>
Prepare a dilute solution by adding about five parts of water to one part of the strong solution.<br>
The gas dissolves in water to form an alkali.<br>

 When a strong electrolyte dissolves in water, it almost completely dissociates into ions.<br>
 Weak electrolytes do not dissociate so much.<br>
 Water is a very weak electrolyte.<br>
 The properties of weak electrolytes are affected both by the properties of the molecules in the solution and the properties of the ions in the solution.<br>
 1. Note the odour of dilute aqueous ammonia solution.<br>
 Shake the solution vigorously and smell by very cautious smelling, as in the diagram.<br>
 Use very small amounts of reacting chemicals.<br>
 Do not inhale directly from a test-tube, but fan the air above the test-tube towards you.<br>

 Ammonia is the most soluble of all gases.<br>
 Ammonia dissolves in water to form ammonia solution, NH3 (aq).<br>
 Do not call it "ammonium hydroxide", because while "(NH4)<sup>+</sup>" ions and "OH<sup>-</sup>" ions can be detected, "(NH4OH)" cannot be detected.<br>

 Fill a flask with ammonia and close the flask with a one-hole stopper with a delivery tube.<br>
 Add litmus to acidified water in a beaker.<br>
 Warm the flask gently to expand the gas and then hold the flask upside down with the lower end of the delivery tube in the acidified water.<br>

 When the flask is full of gas, replace the stopper and jet, and quickly invert the flask with the other end of the jet tube in the litmus solution.<br>
 With the spirit burner at a safe distance, pour a finger width of methylated spirit on the flask and blow on it.<br>
 This causes the spirit to evaporate and thereby cool the flask and the gas inside it.<br>
 The contraction of the gas reduces its pressure, and atmospheric pressure forces litmus solution up the glass tube and out of the jet.<br>
 The fountain from the jet suddenly increases and the litmus changes colour.<br>
 The fountain from the jet suddenly increases for the reason given above.<br>
 The red litmus solution turns blue, because the water in the litmus solution turns part of the ammonia into the alkali ammonium hydroxide.<br>
 3. Gently heat in a bath of warm water 100 mL of concentrated ammonia solution in a 250 mL conical flask fitted with a rubber stopper and a short glass tube.<br>

 Ammonia is less dense than air.<br>
 When the round bottom flask is full of ammonia, insert a rubber stopper fitted with a short glass tube tapered inside to a narrow jet.<br>
 Immerse the external end of the glass tube in water.<br>
 Ammonia will dissolve in the water in the tube, reducing the pressure inside the flask.<br>
 Atmospheric pressure will then force water into the tube, creating a jet of water, called the ammonia fountain.<br>

 <b>Be careful!</b> Prepare ammonia gas only in a fume hood or fume cupboard!<br>
 1. Put a mixture of calcium hydroxide and ammonium chloride into a test-tube to a depth of 4 cm.<br>
 Fill a U-tube with lumps of calcium oxide mixed with cotton wool.<br>
 The cotton wool is to prevent blocking of the U-tube.<br>
 Gently heat the test-tube.<br>
 The calcium oxide is to dry the ammonia gas.<br>
 Collect the less dense gas (0.769 kg / m<sup>3</sup>), by downward displacement of air.<br>
 Test whether the receiver test-tube is full by holding a piece of moist red litmus paper at the opening.<br>
 Ammonia gas turns red litmus blue.<br>
 Collect test-tubes of ammonia gas and apply stoppers.<br>
 2NH4Cl (aq) + Ca(OH)2 (s) --> 2NH4OH (s) + CaCl2 (aq),<br>
 then NH4OH (s) --> NH3 (g) + H2O (l)<br>
 2NH4Cl (aq) + Ca(OH)2 (s) --> 2NH3 (g) + CaCl2 (aq) + 2H2O<br>
 2. Prepare ammonia with ammonium chloride and sodium carbonate<br>
 <a href="../images/1.13.gif">See diagram 1.13</a> : Smelling test.<br>
 Put 5 g of ammonium chloride (sal ammoniac) in 2 cm depth sodium carbonate (washing soda) solution.<br>
 Heat the test-tube.<br>
 Test for ammonia gas and with wet red litmus paper.<br>
 3. Prepare ammonia with ammonia solution and sodium hydroxide.<br>
 Add 15 g of granular sodium hydroxide to 30 mL of concentrated ammonia solution contained in a conical flask.<br>
 Immediately fix in the flask a stopper with a straight delivery tube inserted in it.<br>
 A large quantity of ammonia forms quickly.<br>
 Simultaneously, the temperature of the reaction increases and froth seethes inside the flask.<br>
 NH4Cl (aq) + NaOH (s) --> NaCl (s) + H2O (l) + NH3 (g)<br>
4. Heat a finger width of ammonium chloride mixed with an equal amount of calcium hydroxide in a large test-tube fitted with stopper and delivery tube.<br>
 The test-tube should be inclined slightly, otherwise the water formed in the reaction can flow back into the hot end of the tube.<br>
 Collect the gas by passing it upwards into another test-tube, since ammonia is less dense than air.<br>
 A piece of moist red litmus paper, held at the mouth of the container, will show when each is full.<br>
 Insert a stopper and store the test-tubes of ammonia.<br>
5. Mix a finger width of calcium hydroxide with an equal quantity of ammonium chloride on a sheet of paper.<br>
 Rub the mixture with the glass rod, and notice the smell of ammonia gas evolved.<br>
 Hold a piece of moistened red litmus paper over the mixture.<br>
 The litmus turns blue.<br>
 Ammonia is a gas which, when moist, has alkaline properties.<br>
 6. Prepare ammonia with sodium hydroxide and ammonium salts.<br>
 Moisten a salt spoon of ammonium chloride, carbonate, or sulfate with drops of caustic soda solution.<br>
 Ammonia gas forms.<br>
 It can be tested by smell and by the turning blue of damp red litmus paper.<br>
 7. To prepare dry ammonia gas attach an U-tube packed with calcium oxide granules between the horizontal Pyrex test-tube and the vertical inverted collection test-tube.<br>
 Heat a mixture of ammonium chloride and calcium hydroxide solids in the test-tube and collect the pungent ammonia by upward delivery.<br>
 It has a very pungent odour and turns red litmus blue.<br>
