 <p>Teachers of science in the State of Queensland, Australia, must refer 
 to the latest version of the guidelines "Aspects of Science Management: 
 A Reference Manual for Schools" prepared by the Education Services Directorate, 
 Education Queensland, (PO Box 33, Brisbane) Albert Street, Qld. 4002, 
 Australia. The following information is consistent with these guidelines 
 but does not replace it. 
 <p><a name=3.1.0Lab></a>3.1.0 <b>Laboratory organization that lowers risk 
 level of science activity</b> <br>
 Laboratory organization that lowers the risk level of science activity 
 includes the following: 
 <ol>
 <li>Equipment and chemicals are stored in a systematic, orderly and a 
 neat manner. 
 <li>Equipment and chemicals borrowed from a preparation room or storage 
 area is returned to the assigned place. 
 <li>Teaching and storage rooms are uncluttered with no equipment protruding 
 over benches, no dangling wires and no equipment stored on the floor. 
 <li>Bench tops are always clean. Any spillage is wiped up immediately. 
 <li>Reagent bottles are clearly labelled and filled regularly. 
 <li>Sinks are clean and not blocked with wastes. 
 <li>Separate waste bins are used for broken glass, which must be wrapped, 
 paper, cloth and solid chemical residues. 
 <li>Water outlets, gas turrets on the benches, power outlets and electrical 
 switches are in good working order. Non-asbestos fibro sheets are placed 
 under the Bunsen burners. 
 <li>The laboratory and storeroom doors are locked when not occupied. 
 <li>Time is allowed for all the above. <br>
 &nbsp;</li>
 </ol>
 <a 
name=3.2.0></a>3.2.0 <b>Supervision of Students</b> <br>
 Supervision of students must be continuous and vigilant so that unauthorized 
 or inappropriate behaviour does not lead to accidents resulting in physical 
 injury, fires or other dangers. Teachers should choose a set of laboratory 
 rules. The rules should be prominently displayed and copies given to students. 
 Students should know and understand the rules. Teachers must pay particular 
 attention to the following: 
 <ol>
 <li>Students must not enter any laboratory or storeroom unless a teacher 
 is present. 
 <li>Students must not eat or drink in the laboratory or storeroom. Students 
 must not taste chemicals. 
 <li>Students must behave in a careful and businesslike manner. 
 <li>Student dress must not be dangerous. Pay attention to unconfined long 
 hair, jewellery, ties, unbuttoned long sleeves, loose clothing, synthetic 
 garments that may be a fire hazard. 
 <li>Student footwear must completely cover the feet and protect them from 
 spilt corrosive or hot liquids. Students may not wear sandals. 
 <li>Students should be safely seated and not crowded. Fellow students, 
 chemicals and glassware should not be within "elbow width". </li>
 </ol>
 <a 
name=3.3.0></a>3.3.0 <b>Manipulative Skills</b> <br>
 Teachers should teach the necessary manipulative skills by demonstration 
 before asking students to use the skill in an experiment. These skills include: 
 <ol>
 <li>Lighting and use of a Bunsen burner 
 <li>Heating of liquids or solids in test tubes 
 <li>Heating large volumes of liquids 
 <li>Handling glassware containing hot liquids 
 <li>Carrying glassware 
 <li>Handling of reagent bottles 
 <li>Diluting concentrated acids 
 <li>Inserting glass tubing in rubber stoppers </li>

 <p><a name=3.4.1></a>3.4.1 <b>Handling chemicals</b> <br>
 Students should not touch any chemical. They should use a spatula or gloves. 
 Pipettes should be filled with a pipette-filler and not by sucking by 
 mouth. If students do touch any chemical, they should immediately wash 
 their hands with soap and water 
 <p><a name=3.4.2></a>3.4.2 <b>Chemical vapours</b> <br>
 Isolate chemical vapours by doing experiments in a fume cupboard or by 
 using very small quantities of chemicals near an open window where there 
 is good ventilation. 
 <p><a name=3.4.3></a>3.4.3 <b>Smelling Chemicals</b> <br>
 Do not smell gases directly from the test tube. Use the hand to fan towards 
 the nose and sniff cautiously. If no odour, move closer and try again. 
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><a name=3.4.4></a>3.4.4 <b>Tasting Chemicals</b> <br>
 Never taste a chemical in the laboratory. 
 <p><a name=3.4.5></a>3.4.5 <b>Amount of Chemical Used in Experiments</b> 
 <br>
 In this document, "dilute solution" refers to a 2-M solution, unless otherwise 
 specified. Also, "concentrated acid", or any other substance, refers to 
 the concentration supplied by commercial suppliers, e.g.. concentrated 
 hydrochloric acid is 36% w/w, unless otherwise specified. <br>

 <p align="center"><b>3.5.0 Experimental procedures</b></p>
 <p>Read the label on reagent bottles twice to avoid errors. Always 
 follow exactly the instructions for chemical experiments. Do not 
 substitute another chemical for chemicals specified in this book. 
 Always add a solid to a liquid reagent to achieve better control 
 of gases that form in the reaction. Do not let students do unauthorized 
 experiments. Some chemicals are safe by themselves, but they may 
 form explosive mixtures when mixed with oxidizing agents, e.g.. 
 sulfur, sucrose (cane sugar), and powdered zinc. The use of gas 
 generators, e.g.. Kipp's apparatus, is NOT recommended.</p>

 <p align="center"><a name=3.6.0></a><b>3.6.0 </b><font size="+1" color="#000066">Dangerous 
 chemicals</font>
 <p><a name=3.6.1></a>3.6.1 <b>Toxicity</b> <br>
 Toxicity is the capacity of a substance to cause harm. All substances 
 should be considered as partially toxic . The toxicity of a substance 
 is determined by the quantity of that substance required to cause harm. 
 It is usually reported as an LD50 oral rate, i.e.. the lethal dose that 
 will kill 50% of a sample rate population if administered orally. The 
 following values are approximate indicators for ingestion: 
 <ul>
 <li>very toxic: LD50 &lt; 25 mg/kg body weight; 
 <li>toxic: &lt; 200 mg/kg body weight; 
 <li>harmful: &lt; 2000 mg/kg body weight </li>
 </ul>
 Risks of injury associated with any particular chemical relate directly 
 to the route of entry, i.e. ingestion, inhalation or skin contact. A substance 
 that may be very toxic by ingestion may be quite safe to handle if it is 
 not to be ingested. 
 <p><a name=3.6.2></a>3.6.2 <b>Corrosive substances</b> <br>
 Corrosive substances are those that cause severe skin damage. How corrosive 
 a substance is depends on the length of time taken for the damage to occur. 
 Splashes to the eyes present a far greater risk of severe injury than 
 splashes to skin. The following are approximate indicators of corrosiveness: 
 <ul>
 <li>highly corrosive: causes visible severe skin damage at the site of 
 contact in less than 3 minutes, 
 <li>corrosive: causes visible severe skin damage at the site of contact 
 in a period of 3 to 60 minutes, 
 <li>irritating: causes visible severe skin damage at the site of contact 
 in a period of up to four hours. </li>
 </ul>
 <a name=3.6.3></a>3.6.3 <b>Hygroscopic and deliquescent chemicals</b> <br>
 Hygroscopic substances absorb water from the air. Deliquescent substances 
 are hygroscopic substances that absorb water to such an extent that they 
 form a concentrated solution of the substance. Both hygroscopic and deliquescent 
 substances may absorb moisture from tissue and consequently should be treated 
 as potentially highly corrosive <br>
 <p><a name=3.6.4></a>3.6.4 <b>Correct names of chemicals</b> <br>
 (a) Usually, the chemical name used in this document is the standard name 
 followed by synonyms. These names were checked with names in the document 
 "Education Queensland (Australia) - Aspects of Science management: A reference 
 manual for Schools" 1997 and the catalogue of Phillip Harris, UK. Chemicals 
 marked with an asterisk, e.g. EDTA*, are not in the List of Chemicals 
 in the Appendix 
 <p><a name=3.6.5></a>3.6.5 <b>Dangerous chemicals</b> <br>
 (a) The experiments do not require the use of any chemicals with the following 
 hazard classifications: EXPLOSIVE, OXIDIZING, TOXIC, RADIOACTIVE, HIGHLY 
 FLAMMABLE or EXTREMELY FLAMMABLE (flash point 21<sup>o</sup>C), or any 
 chemical specified in the Schedule 1 of the Poison Rules, UK. However, 
 some experiments requiring the use of acetone (propanone) as a solvent 
 are included. Preparations of small amounts of some dangerous gases are 
 included on the assumption that only experienced science teachers demonstrate 
 the experiment and direct observation of these gases has educational value. 
 These experiments contain the warning "<span 
style="COLOR: #ff0000">BE CAREFUL!</span>" . This experiment must be done in a 
 fume cupboard. Another criterion for including some limited handling of 
 dangerous substances by experienced teachers is that students may experience 
 these substances in their daily lives. Acetone is used for nail polish 
 remover. Chlorine compounds are used for bleaches and water disinfectants. 
 Sulfuric is used in a motor car battery.

 <tr bgcolor="#FFCC99"> 
 <td>The warning "<font color="#FF0033">BE CAREFUL!</font>" is used in 
 this document where experiments or procedures require special care. 
 However, the experiments described have been selected on the basis 
 that a trained science teacher practises them before deciding whether 
 to include them in the teaching programme. The trained science teacher 
 who has the duty of care must decide which students are allowed to 
 do the experiments themselves. </td>

 <p><a name=3.6.6></a>3.6.6 <b>Sto<a name="366"></a>ring Chemicals</b> 
 <ul>
 <li>Store concentrated acids in plastic boxes on the floor. 
 <li>Store flammable liquids at eye level in a well ventilated area away 
 from heat sources. 
 <li>Store powerful oxidizing agents away from other chemicals, e.g. in 
 a desiccator. Oxidizing materials are chemicals that support combustion 
 or burning. If they are placed in contact with materials that act as 
 fuels, there is danger of an explosion or fire. Oxidizing materials 
 include chlorates, peroxides, perchlorates, and perchloric acid. Sodium 
 chlorate is dangerous if not handled safely. Keep it away from strong 
 acids and any substances that are easily oxidized, e.g. sulfur, sulfides, 
 phosphorus, sucrose (cane sugar), alcohols, organic solvents, ammonium 
 compounds, powdered metals, oils or grease, and dust. 
 <li>Store ammonia as with acids but separate from them, not near oxidizing 
 agents 
 <li>Store formalin in glass bottles away from hydrochloric acid. 
 <li>Store concentrated sodium hydroxide as with acids but separate from 
 them. Do not use glass stoppers. 
 <li>Because of constant use, reagent solutions and solids must be constantly 
 checked and replaced where necessary from stock bottles. The reagent 
 bottles should be labelled with the name of the substance and the concentration 
 of the solution. Unused reagents should never be returned to the stock 
 bottles. </li>
 </ul>
 <a name=3.7.0></a>3.7.0 <b>Protective clothing</b> 
 <ul>
 <li>Students must wear protective glasses or safety goggles when diluting 
 concentrated acids, bases, or heat chemicals. There is always the danger 
 of hot or caustic materials being splashed into the eyes. 
 <li>Students in chemistry classes should wear strong shoes and take care 
 of unbuttoned long sleeves and long hair. 
 <li>Students must wear protective clothing, e.g. gloves, aprons, safety 
 goggles, when necessary. Students must wear safety goggles when chemicals 
 are being handled. Teachers should be aware of students who wear contact 
 lenses. </li>
 </ul>
 <a name=3.8.0></a>3.8.0 <b>Disposal of Chemicals</b> <br>
 Do not keep any chemicals that do not have labels, are not listed in this 
 book, or are not on a list of chemicals approved by the Department of Education. 
 Ask a Government Chemical laboratory how to dispose of them. Do not burn 
 unwanted chemicals because they may form carcinogenic gases. 
 <h4>Methods of disposal</h4>
 <ul>
 <li>Wash to waste in a sink. 
 <li>Dilute with a large volume of water, then neutralize with sodium carbonate 
 or dilute hydrochloric acid, then wash to waste in a sink. 
 <li>Add water or strong alkali or let evaporate in a fume cupboard. 
 <li>Dispose with normal refuse. 
 <li>Deliver to Government Chemical Laboratory. </li>
 </ul>
 <a name=3.9.0></a>3.9.0 <b>Mercury</b> <br>
 Do not use mercury in experiments. Mercury vapour is TOXIC and may damage 
 the nervous system. Mercury enters the body readily by inhalation by ingestion 
 or through the skin. It causes poisoning and damage to the nervous system. 
 Give any mercury stored in the laboratory to a government laboratory. If 
 mercury is spilt from a broken thermometer, immediately pick up all the 
 mercury with a damp cloth or a water suction pump. Sprinkle sulfur powder 
 over the area of the spillage and collect it. This book does not include 
 use of mercury salts or compounds. 
 <p><a name=3.10.0></a>3.10.0 <b>Acids and Bases</b> <br>
 Make dilute acids by slowly adding <b>ACID TO WATER</b>. Keep concentrated 
 mineral acids, e.g. hydrochloric sulfuric or nitric acids in a special 
 put on the floor of a locked cupboard. Only the teacher or laboratory 
 worker may handle concentrated acids or strong bases. Wear safety glasses 
 to protect the eyes when handling concentrated acids. Students may handle 
 dilute mineral acids and bases, but if they are spilt on the skin or in 
 the eyes, wash immediately with plenty of water. Organic acids are not 
 so dangerous as mineral acids, but phenol (carbolic acid) and ethanedioic 
 acid-2-water (oxalic acid) are <b>TOXIC</b>. Strong bases, e.g. sodium 
 hydroxide (caustic soda) and potassium hydroxide (caustic potash) can 
 cause burns. Weaker bases, e.g. calcium hydroxide (lime water, slaked 
 lime), can cause burns if they are left in contact with the skin. 
 <p align="center"><a name=3.11.0></a><br>
 3.11.0 <font size="+1" color="#000066">Fire</font> 
 <p><a name=3.11.1></a>3.11.1 <b>Equipment</b> <br>
 The location and mode of operation of fire extinguishers, fire blankets 
 and sand buckets must be known by all participants in any science activity. 
 Safety equipment, especially fire extinguishers, should be checked frequently 
 to make sure they are in working condition. They should be checked for 
 leakage, tampering and expiration of use-by dates. Store fire extinguishers 
 on the floor near the front door of the laboratory. Keep a fire blanket 
 near the fire extinguishers. School laboratories should have two doors. 
 <p><a name=3.11.2></a>3.11.2 <b>Fire Prevention</b> <br>
 Fires in school areas for the teaching of science may arise from chemical 
 reactions, electrical faults, gas leakage and poor laboratory procedures. 
 The speed with which the fire can spread will depend on the nature of 
 the burning substances and the materials close to the fire. Fires of solids 
 propagate slowly. Fires of liquids spread less rapidly. Gas, vapour or 
 dust fires propagate so rapidly that they seem to explode. 
 <p><a name=3.11.3></a>3.11.3 <b>Possible sources of ignition </b>
 <ul>
 <li>Matches should be completely extinguished after use and placed in 
 a non-flammable container. They should not be thrown into a waste receptacle. 
 Friction or piezoelectric lighters can be used instead of matches in 
 some circumstances. 
 <li>Bunsen burner flames may be nearly invisible in strong light. If there 
 is a need to leave the burners alight when not in use, the flame should 
 be made visible by closing the air hole. 
 <li>Apparatus used during heating should be allowed to cool before storage. 
 <li>Hot objects should not be placed directly on bench tops, paper or 
 other flammable substances. A cool gauze mat should be used. 
 <li>Hot plates, radiators and similar sources of high heat should not 
 normally be operated unattended or left turned on overnight. 
 <li>Sodium and phosphorus should not be left exposed to air. 
 <li>All paper, hair and flammable clothing should be kept away from flames 
 during experiments. 
 <li>Gas installations. All personnel involved in science activities must 
 know the position of the isolating valve for the room and the isolating 
 valve at the bottled gas cylinders or gas meter. 
 <li>Gas fittings on the benches and hoses connecting Bunsen burners to 
 gas turrets should be regularly inspected to ensure leak-free connections. 
 <li>Students must not tamper with any gas fittings. </li>
 </ul>
 <a 
name=3.11.4></a>3.11.4 <b>Flammable substances</b> <br>
 Flammability varies with the ease with which a solid, liquid, vapour or 
 gas will ignite easily and burn rapidly. There are many factors used to 
 measure flammability such as ignition temperature and flash point. The following 
 are descriptions of various degrees of flammability: 
 <ul>
 <li>Highly flammable substances have a very low boiling point, form vapours 
 easily at room temperature and are easily ignited. 
 <li>Flammable substances have a higher boiling point, form vapours less 
 easily and require a higher temperature for ignition. 
 <li>Combustible substances do not form vapours easily at room temperature 
 and require a much higher temperature for ignition. </li>
 </ul>
 <a 
name=3.11.5></a>3.11.5 <b>Flammable liquids</b> <br>
 No sources of ignition should be used near flammable liquids. Some common 
 flammable liquids are listed below. Low flash point substances ignite very 
 easily: may form an explosive vapour-air mixture. The following flammable 
 liquids are included in this document provided the precautions listed in 
 this document are followed.<br>

 3.11.6 <b>Flammable gases</b> 
 <ul>
 <li>All sources of ignition should be extinguished when handling flammable 
 gases. If ignition tests of gases are being demonstrated, use only small 
 quantities. The source of gas should be closed off or well removed from 
 the demonstration. 
 <li>If the combustion of substances in an oxygen rich environment is being 
 demonstrated, only small quantities should be used. The substance may 
 flare and burn rapidly. 
 <li>Many propellant gases in pressure cans are flammable. Carbon dioxide 
 cylinders should not be used as a source of propellant gases. 
 <li>Some fluorescent lights, electrical switches and transmitting devices 
 (radios and mobile telephones) may be sources of ignition. </li>
 </ul>
 <a 
name=3.11.7></a>3.11.7 <b>Combustible Solids</b> 
 <ul>
 <li>Most combustible solids will not present a great fire hazard unless 
 they are ground into a powder. Powders of combustible solids can be 
 explosive when dispersed in air. Metals in a finely divided form, e.g. 
 zinc dust, may ignite easily. 
 <li>Unstable solids may decompose explosively if heated or subjected to 
 friction. These include: potassium chlorate; sodium nitrate; potassium 
 nitrate; and powdered metal and sulfur. 
 <li>Strong oxidizing agents must be kept away from organic substances 
 as the combination may lead to spontaneous ignition. 
 <li>Some solids will react spontaneously and exothermally with water or 
 air. These include lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, hydrides, nitrides, 
 sulfides, acid anhydrides and concentrated acids and alkalis. Use only 
 small quantities. Small narrow necked containers should never be used. 
 Appropriate procedures to avoid contact with these substances and their 
 products should be followed. </li>
 </ul>
 <a name=3.11.8></a>3.11.8 <b>Electrical fires</b> 
 <ul>
 <li>The electrical wiring in science laboratories and other activity areas 
 should be adequately protected against overloading by circuit breakers. 
 Repairs should be done only by a qualified electrician. 
 <li>Wiring should not be overloaded by using appliances or equipment whose 
 current rating is greater than that of the power outlet. General purpose 
 outlets (GPOs) were usually rated at 10 amps. Some GPOs may be rated 
 at 15 amps. 
 <li>The use of double adapters should be avoided. Portable power boards 
 (multiple point power boards), especially those with circuit breakers, 
 should be used. 
 <li>All power leads must be in good condition, of the appropriate current 
 rating for the appliance(s) being used, and of the minimum length necessary 
 for practical use. </li>

 <a name=3.11.9></a>3.11.9 <b>Some practices to prevent fires in teaching 
 areas</b> 
 <ul>
 <li>Appropriate storage, handling and disposal procedures for chemicals 
 should be followed as shown in<a href="#366"> 3.6.6. </a>
 <li>Good ventilation should be maintained in laboratories and preparation 
 rooms to reduce the chances of flammable vapours or gases building up. 
 <li>Procedures that release flammable vapours would normally be carried 
 out in a fume cupboard or an appropriate outdoor location. 
 <li>Large quantities of flammable liquids should not be stored in the 
 laboratory. Bulk quantities should be stored in a preparation room or 
 appropriate store room. 
 <li>Flammable liquids should not be stored or used near sources of ignition. 
 <li>Flammable liquids should only be heated on water baths using electrical 
 hot plates, not Bunsen burners. 
 <li>Apparatus to be used in heating must be carefully checked for defects, 
 such as small cracks or uneven thickness. 
 <li>All fires and hazardous occurrences must be reported in the appropriate 
 manner. </li>
 </ul>
 <a name=3.11.10></a>3.11.10 <b>Action in Case of Fire</b> 
 <ul>
 <li><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">Clothes on fire</span> If 
 a person's clothes have caught fire, lay the person down, 'roll them 
 over' and smother the flames with the fire blanket. Seek urgent medical 
 attention for any burns. Dry chemical fire extinguishers can be used 
 on all types of fires. Follow the manufacturer's instructions. 
 <li><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">Evacuation&nbsp;</span>If 
 a fire should break out in an area for the teaching of science, the 
 students must be moved from the source of the fire and evacuated, if 
 necessary. A whole school evacuation may be necessary. Observe the school's 
 evacuation procedures, including contact with the fire brigade. Besides 
 the school fire drill, science classes should practice a special fire 
 drill for the laboratory. </li>

 <div align="left"><a name=3.12.0></a>3.12.0 <b>Using Test Tubes and Containers<br>
 </b>Never look down a test tube or point the open end of a test tube at 
 a person while a reaction occurs. Hold it up to the light and look from 
 the side. Before putting chemicals to a test tube, first put the test 
 tube in a test tube rack. When heating substances in test tubes, move 
 the test tube back and forth across the flame. Point the mouth of the 
 tube away from nearby persons. When transferring materials from one container 
 to another, hold the containers at arms length. </div>
 <p><a name=3.13.0></a>3.13.0 <b>Glassware</b> <br>
 Check glassware for cracks before use. Put broken glass metal pieces and 
 unused chemicals in a specially marked container and bury them. Microscope 
 slides and cover slips are easily broken. Do not leave broken pieces on 
 the desk. After each class where microscopes are used, wipe the benches 
 with a damp cloth to remove broken glass. 
 <p><a name=3.14.0></a>3.14.0 <b>Glass Tubing</b> <br>
 Hold glass tubing wrapped in a towel before inserting it through a hole 
 in a stopper. First lubricate the glass tubing with glycerol or water. 
 Then hold it with the towel. Then push it through the stopper with a twisting 
 motion.
