 1. Use a small jar with a screw-on metal lid.<br>
 Invert the metal lid on a block of wood and use a large nail to punch a hole in the centre.<br>
 Note that when you replace the lid on the jar, the projecting metal around the hole will point upward.<br>
 Make a wick by tearing away a strip from old cloth.<br>
 Use a pencil to push the end of the wick through the hole in the lid, starting from the smooth side of the hole.<br>
 Half fill the jar with methylated spirits.<br>
 Screw the lid tightly on the jar and light the wick.<br>
 The metal lid will conduct heat away from the flame so that the flame does not go below the lid into the methylated spirits.<br>
 2. Use a small bottle with a screw metal cap as a simple spirit burner (an alcohol lamp).<br>
 Punch a hole in the centre of the metal cap.<br>
 Enlarge the hole so that a metal tube 4 cm long fits into the hole.<br>
 Push the tube 1 cm into the bottle.<br>
 Make a wick from cotton waste or a cotton bath towel.<br>
 Put the wick in the bottle and pull it up through the tube.<br>
 Fill the bottle with methylated spirit.<br>
 Make a simple tripod stand with tin snips to cut away the sides of a tin can.<br>
 The wick should protrude about 3 cm from the cap and fit tightly into the wick holder.<br>
 The wick holder should fit tightly into the burner.<br>
 Use only methylated spirit or absolute alcohol (ethanol), as the fuel in the spirit burner.<br>
 3. Place the spirit burner on a metal tray or where it cannot be knocked over, i.e. not within "elbow radius" of the user.<br>
 Keep the container of methylated spirit stored in another room.<br>
 To fill the spirit burner, remove the screw cap containing the wick and use a filter funnel to three quarters fill the glass reservoir.<br>
 Replace the screw cap, screw it down tightly, and wipe the spirit burner dry of methylated spirit.<br>
 Wash the filter funnel.<br>
 4. To put out the spirit burner (extinguish the flame), place a dry test-tube over it so that the rim of the test-tube touches the cap of the spirit burner, or use the glass / ceramic caps are fitted to some spirit
 burners, to extinguish the flame.<br>
 The spirit burner flame is almost invisible so be sure that the flame is really extinguished before handling or moving the spirit burner.<br>
 5. Students should not be allowed to lift the spirit burner or remove it from the bench.<br>
 However, they may move the spirit burner by sliding to move it to a safer or more convenient position.<br>
 6. Make an alcohol lamp, spirit lamp, from an ink bottle.<br>
 Use an ink bottle with a screw-on metallic cap, a metallic sheet of 2.5 cm × 4 cm, alcohol, and a wick made up of wasted cotton or cotton bath towel of length twice the height of the ink bottle.<br>
 Drill a hole with a nail in the centre of the cap of the bottle.<br>
 Use a file to enlarge the hole to diameter 10 mm and use a hard round object, e.g. a round file, to burnish the hole.<br>
 Roll the small metallic sheet into a cylinder.<br>
 The outer diameter of the cylinder is equal to the inner diameter of the hole on the cap of the bottle.<br>
 Push the cylinder about 1 cm into the hole on the cap.<br>
 If possible, solder the cylinder on the cap, and solder the cracks between the cylinder and the cap.<br>
 Insert the wick into the cylinder on the cap and leave a part of itslength outside of the cap and trim that part.<br>
 Fill fuel into the bottle, but not full.<br>
 Screw the cap on the bottle tightly to prevent evaporation.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="8.3.01H">8.3.01</a> Burn candles in closed containers<br>
<a href="/images/6.35.0.gif">See diagram 8.3.0</a>: Candles burning in closed containers.<br>
When you light a candle wick, some heat from the burning wick melts the wax at the top of the candle.<br>
The melted wax rises in the wick, because of capillary forces and some of that wax evaporates to form a vapour that rises then burns with a bright flame.<br>
The flame of a burning candle in a closed container will go out after some time, not, because all the oxygen is used up, but, because the hot carbon dioxide and water vapour produced by the ignition accumulates 
 down from the top of the container, displaces other gases, including oxygen, and finally stifles the flame.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="8.3.1H">8.3.1</a> Burn a floating candle under a jar<br>
<a href="/images/6.35.0.gif">See diagram 6.35.0</a>: Candles burning in closed containers.<br>
 1. Fix a short candle to a cork.<br>
 Put water in the trough so that the water level is about half the length of the candle.<br>
 Put water in the trough.<br>
 The short candle on the cork floats in the water.<br>
 2. Measure the depth of the water in the trough.<br>
 Measure the length of the jar.<br>
 The jar is full of air so you are really measuring how much air in the jar.<br>
 Light the candle.<br>
 3. Place an inverted jar over the candle quickly so that the mouth of the jar is under water.<br>
 4. While the candle is alight, gas bubbles come out from under the jar and rise through the water in the trough.<br>
 The candle flame heated the air in the jar causing the air to expand.<br>
 Lighter gases go to the top of the jar, because gravity exerts a stronger pull on denser gases.<br>
 As these colder, denser gases move downward, lighter gases take their place at the top of the jar.<br>
 5. The candle flame gets smaller, splutters, then goes out, because some oxygen was converted to carbon dioxide gas.<br>
 The blackened wick is carbon.<br>
 6. The volume of gases in the jar decreases, because the gases in the jar cool, some water vapour condenses inside the jar and on the 
 wick and some carbon dioxide dissolves in the water.<br>
 The gases in the jar cool and contract to a smaller volume than before so the air pressure in the jar becomes less than the atmospheric pressure.<br>
 The air pressure on the surface of the water in the trough pushes the water up into the jar.<br>
 The water level rises in the jar and drops slightly in the trough.<br>
 7. The decrease of volume inside the jar is about 20%.<br>
 Some people wrongly think that the candle flame has "consumed" all the oxygen and that the amount of oxygen consumed = the decrease in volume of gases in the jar, thus showing that air contains 
 20 % oxygen.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="8.3.2H">8.3.2</a> Burn a long candle standing under a jar<br>
<a href="/images/6.35.0.gif">See diagram 6.35.0</a>: Candles burning in closed containers.<br>
 1. Stand a long candle in a trough.<br>
 Put 3 rubber plugs on the bottom of the trough so that the rim of a jar may rest on them and allow water to enter under the jar.<br>
 2. Put water in the trough so that the water level is about half up the length of the candle.<br>
 Measure the depth of the water in the trough.<br>
 Measure the length of the jar.<br>
 3. Light the candle.<br>
 Quickly place an inverted jar over the lighted candle so that the mouth of the jar is under water, resting on the three rubber plugs.<br>
 4. While the candle is alight, gas bubbles come out from under the jar and rise through the water in the trough.<br>
 5. The candle flame gets smaller, splutters, then goes out.<br>
 6. The water level rises in the jar and drops slightly in the trough.<br>
 7. Some water has condensed inside the jar and on the wick.<br>
 8. The decrease of volume inside the jar is about 20%.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="8.3.3H">8.3.3</a> Burn long and short candles over water<br>
<a href="/images/6.35.7.gif">See diagram 6.35.7</a>: Burn long and short candles over water.<br>
 1. Attach a tall candle and a short candle to the bottom of a trough.<br>
 Add water to the trough and note the water level.<br>
 Add ink or cochineal to colour the water.<br>
 Light both candles.<br>
 Put an inverted jar over the burning candles.<br>
 The tall candle extinguishes first then the short candle.<br>
 Hot gas and less dense products of combustion including carbon dioxide gas and water vapour have filled the jar from the top down to extinguish the tall candle flame first.<br>
 The cloud of hot carbon dioxide and water vapour gets thicker and so descends to reach the tall candle flame first.<br>
 Some hot gases push out under the rim of the jar to form bubbles around the jar in the trough.<br>
 When the candles are extinguished, the hot gases cool and contract to form a partial vacuum and the water level rises inside the jar.<br>
 This experiment shows that in the above experiments the lighted candle did not "use up the oxygen in the jar", because when the tall candle goes out the short candle keeps burning for some time.<br>
 Candles will not burn when air has lost about 30% of its oxygen.<br>

<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="8.3.4H">8.3.4</a> Burn a candle, lighted inside a jar<br>
<a href="/images/6.35.4.gif">See diagram 6.35.4</a>: Ignite candle inside jar.<br>
 This is a more accurate way of doing the experiment, because the candle is not already burning when the inverted jar is placed over it.<br>
 So you are comparing the volumes of room temperature air before combustion and after combustion.<br>
 1. Use adhesive tape to attach the head of a match to a candle wick.<br>
 2. Place an inverted jay over the candle.<br>
 3. Light the match by focussing sunlight on it.<br>
 4. Leave the apparatus to cool to room temperature.<br>
 5. Measure the increase in water level inside the inverted jar.<br>
 The increase is about 5%, not 20%.<br>

<a href="/images/6.35.5.gif">See diagram 6.35.5</a>: Burn candles over water.<br>
 1. Fix the candles to Plasticine (modelling clay), at the bottom of the tray, then do the experiment as before.<br>
 2. The air in the jar is less heated with smaller candles so you probably do not see bubbles coming out from under the jar.<br>
 The jars contained about the same amount of oxygen, but the jar with the three candles showed the greatest water rise, because more heat was produced by the candles in it.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="8.3.6H">8.3.6</a> Burn a candle in falling plastic bottle<br>
<a href="/images/6.35.6.gif">See diagram 6.35.6</a>: Burning candle in falling plastic bottle.<br>
 Attach a candle to the screw top of a plastic bottle.<br>
 Darken the room.<br>
 Light the candle, attach the screw top, and drop the plastic bottle.<br>
 The candle flame heat the air around the wick, but the hot air falls with the same speed as the candle.<br>
 So the wick remains surrounded by the hot air and the products of combustion of the candle wax vapour.<br>
 Immediately after the plastic bottle is dropped, the candle flame becomes dimmer as a blue spherical disc.<br>
 The flame receives only a small supply of oxygen by diffusion, because the carbon dioxide remains around it and is replaced by the oxygen when it rises.<br>
 Hot carbon dioxide, and some water vapour, accumulate at the top over the candle until the flame is extinguished.<br>

<a href="/images/6.35.3.gif">See diagram 6.35.3</a>: Burn long and short candles over water.<br>
 1. Burn two candles over water.<br>
 Attach a tall candle and a short candle to the bottom of a trough.<br>
 Add water to the trough and note the water level.<br>
 Light both candles.<br>
 Put a large jar upside down over the candles.<br>
 The tall candle extinguishes first then the short candle.<br>
 Hot gas products of combustion, including carbon dioxide gas, have filled the jar from the top down to extinguish the candle flames.<br>
 Some hot gases push out under the rim of the jar to form bubbles around the jar in the trough.<br>
 When the candles are extinguished, the hot gases cool and contract to form a partial vacuum, and the water level rises inside the jar.<br>
2. In the jar over the tall candle, the water rises almost immediately, mostly before the flame is extinguished.<br>
 In the jar over the short candle, the water hardly rises until the flame dies, then rises rapidly.<br>
 When the candle goes out, most of the cooling of gases occurs at the top of the jar, where the air is hottest and contact with the glass is greatest.<br>
 The taller candle begins to dim earlier, caused by the smothering cloud of carbon dioxide, so the flame gives off less heat.<br>
 So the rate of cooling is largely determined by the temperature of the air at the top of the jar.<br>
 The flames of shorter candles are farther away from the top, so they take longer to heat up the air up there.<br>
 By the time a short candle completely goes out, much carbon dioxide has been produced, mostly lying close to the water.<br>
 After the air cools, there is more opportunity for the carbon dioxide to dissolve into the water than with a tall candle.<br>
 This may contribute to the rapid rise after a short candle is extinguished, because the air is losing carbon dioxide.<br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="8.1.22H">8.1.22</a> Test for carbon dioxide from a burning candle<br>
 Cut off each end of a plastic drink bottle to make a cylinder.<br>
 Place the cylinder vertically around the candles.<br>
 Pour sodium bicarbonate solution then tartaric acid solution into the water around the candles.<br>
 The acid reacts with the base to form bubbles of carbon dioxide gas.<br>
 As the cylinder fills with carbon dioxide gas the short candle flame then the long candle flame will be extinguished as the carbon dioxide gas displaces the air upwards.<br>
 Try to relight the candle with a match or taper.<br>
 The flame is extinguished when it reaches the carbon dioxide layer.<br>
 Make a loop with a piece of wire, dip it in a soap or detergent solution and blow a small bubble so that it falls gently into the cylinder.<br>
 The bubble will stop falling when it reaches the carbon dioxide gas layer.<br>

A flame is a region where a gas emits light, because of the high temperature.<br>
 Burning, i.e. combustion, needs oxygen gas, is exothermic process and has reaction products are carbon dioxide and water.<br>
 Spontaneous combustion does not need external heat energy to start it, e.g. white phosphorus in air.<br>
 Combustible substances catch fire easily, e.g. paper.<br>
 You can smother a flame to cut off the oxygen gas supply and put out the fire.<br>
 Water is used to put out fire, because it reduces the temperature of substances below its ignition point.<br>
 However, the temperature of burning oil is too high for an oil fire to be extinguished by water.<br>
 Most fire extinguishers either reduce the ignition temperature or cut off the oxygen gas supply.<br>

 Striking causes friction to generate heat to raise the temperature of red phosphorus to ignition temperature.<br>
 The match head contains mainly potassium chlorate, sulfur, fillers and glue.<br>
 The striking surface on the side of the matchbox contains mainly red phosphorus and powdered glass to cause friction.<br>
 In 1826 John Walker, London, invented the first matches called "Friction Lights", which were we copied and sold as "Lucifers" in 1829.<br>
 The "strike-anywhere" match, "lucifer match" can be ignited by striking the head of the match on any rough surface, e.g. the sole of a boot.<br>
 They are still used by campers, but are not allowed in some countries.<br>

"Pack up your troubles in your old kit-bag<br>
 And smile, smile, smile<br>

 The heads of the matchsticks contain potassium chlorate as an outside layer on the phosphorus sesquioxide (P4O6), match head.<br>
 Explosions based on collections of match heads are not permitted in schools.<br>
 The chemical that initiates the flame, phosphorous sulfide, is in the match head so friction will start it burning.<br>
 Safety matches used the strong oxidising agent potassium chlorate to react with sulfur.<br>
 The flame formed ignites the wax below the match head then the wooden match stick.<br>
 An early brand of safety matches contained:<br>
1. In the match heads<br>
Ammonium dihydrogen phosphate, to prevent afterglow and so no smouldering match to ignite something.<br>
Paraffin wax to coat the matchstick.<br>
Potassium chlorate for the chemical reaction with sulfur.<br>
Powdered glass to initiate heat from friction of about 200<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
Pigment and glue.
2. In the striking surface on the side of the matchbox<br>
Red phosphorus is stable, but is converted to flammable white phosphorus by friction.<br>

<a href="/images/3.1.2.4ch.gif">See diagram 3.1.2.4</a>: Bunsen burner flame, Candle flame.<br>
 1. Bunsen burner flame<br>
 A flame is the region where combustion occurs.<br>
 The colour of the flame depends on the temperature and the substance burning.<br>
 Hydrocarbon flames are either blue or yellow.<br>
 A blue flame is not luminous.<br>
 It occurs, because of complete burning of hydrocarbons with plenty of oxygen gas.<br>
 The blue flame does not leave any residue or any other gases.<br>
 A yellow flame occurs when there is insufficient oxygen gas.<br>
 It is a luminous flame.<br>
 The temperature is lower than the blue flame and it leaves black soot and other residues.<br>
 2. Candle flame
 A candle contains wax made from petrochemicals.<br>
 The wick is lighted, and the flame melts the wax.<br>
 The evaporated wax rises and catches fire.<br>
 As the vapours rise higher, they stay longer in the hot regions of the flame and start burning completely with oxygen gas.<br>
 A candle flame has three regions.<br>
 The inner zone appears black, contains unburned wax vapours and is the least hot region of the candle.<br>
 The middle zone is where the wax vapours start burning giving a yellowish flame of partially burnt gases, because of insufficient gases for complete combustion.<br>
 The flame in the luminous region, but not very hot.<br>
 The outer zone is where the wax vapours have enough oxygen gas to burn completely.<br>
 The flame appears blue and the temperature is very high, up to 1 100<sup>o</sup>C or more.<br>

 <a href="/images/3.1.2.6ch.gif">See diagram 3.1.2.6</a>: Candle burner.<br>
Candle wax is a mixture of different alkanes that are solid at room temperature.<br>
Candles are usually made of paraffin wax that is a residue from the distillation of petroleum.<br>
With enough air, the wax burns to form carbon dioxide and water.<br>
With insufficient air, the wax burns to form carbon monoxide and smoke containing carbon.<br>
The teardrop-shaped flame is called a diffusion flame, because oxygen gas diffuses in from the air to the combustion region and hydrocarbon vapour diffuses out wards form the wick.<br>
Heat radiated from the burning wick melts the wax drawn up the wick by capillarity.<br>
The melted wax vaporizes to form a cloud of hydrocarbon molecules that diffused into the flame and are broken down into small molecules by the intense heat of the flame.<br>
The smaller molecules react with oxygen.<br>
The smoke from the flame contains carbon particles (soot), water vapour and various products of the reactions of the hydrocarbon particles with oxygen gas.<br>
Experiments<br>
1. Cut the top off one of a clear plastic soft drink bottle and fill it with water.<br>
Float a candle on the water.<br>
 Light the candle.<br>
A cup of molten wax forms around the wick.<br>
As the candle flame burns the wax melts and moves up the wick by capillarity, then is converted to a vapour by the heat of the flame.<br>
The vapour rises and burns to form more flame.<br>
The ascending current of air, produced by the heat of the candle, keeps the outside edge cool, and forms a cup for the melted wax around the wick.<br>
The rising vapour draws up cold air containing oxygen gas.<br>
2. See the shape of the flame with three regions:<br>
* The innermost part is a dark area, the shape of the flame around the wick.<br>
It is not luminous and consists of the vapour from the molten wax.<br>
* The coloured part of the flame is orange-yellow to blue near the bottom.<br>
It is where some combustion occurs.<br>
* The outer, almost colourless region of the flame is where most combustion occurs, because more air (oxygen gas), is available.<br>
Blow out the candle then ignite again the vapour quickly with a lit match.<br>
The flame will go down and ignite again the candle.<br>
Complete combustion of the wax hydrocarbon should produce carbon dioxide and water only, but the candle flame is not hot enough to allow complete combustion so a mixture of 
gases and tiny specks of black carbon (soot), forms.<br>
The glowing carbon particles glow and are the main emitters of candle light.<br>
Hold a white plate above the flame to see the black soot.<br>
Suspend a suspended spiral of paper above the candle flame.<br>
The spiral turns, because of the force of the rising hot gases from the candle flame.<br>
3. Relight a candle.<br>
Light a match, then blow out the candle, keeping the match lit.<br>
Then immediately bring the burning match close to the smoking candle wick and observe closely.<br>
Note when the candle flame reignites.<br>
4. Repeat this experiment with a cold candle that has not been recently burning.<br>
A wax vapour still exists in the space between the hot wick and the match flame.<br>
Candle wax, or paraffin, is a mixture of high molecular weight saturated hydrocarbons consisting mostly of long chains of (-CH2-) units.<br>
The simplest hydrocarbon, methane, burns as follows:<br>
CH4 + 2O2 --> CO2 + 2H2O<br>
A single (-CH2-) unit burns as follows:<br>
2CH2 + 3O2 --> 2CO2 + 2H2O.<br>

The outer zone is where the wax vapours have enough oxygen gas to burn completely.<br>
The flame appears blue and the temperature is very high.<br>
2. Hold a piece of white cardboard behind the flame, so that you can see each part clearly.<br>
The candle flame has three regions.<br>
Each region has the shape of the flame around the wick.<br>
* The innermost region closest to the wick consists of vapours from the molten wax.<br>
It is dark in colour, because air cannot reach that region, so the gases are not burning.<br>
* The second region is bright yellow to orange to blue near the bottom.<br>
It forms much light.<br>
Incandescent soot particles cause some orange and yellow glow.<br>
The red area near the centre of the flame is about 800<sup>o</sup>C.<br>
The outer orange and yellow areas are hotter than this region.<br>
Some combustion occurs in this region.<br>
* The third region, the outer rim of the flame, is practically colourless.<br>
It is a very faint blue colour and is the hottest part of the candle flame.<br>
The blue colour shows that oxygen is mixing with the wax molecules.<br>
Most of the combustion occurs in this region.<br>
Complete combustion of the paraffin hydrocarbons should produce carbon dioxide and water only, but the candle flame may not be hot enough to produce complete combustion, so intermediate substances form.<br>
Tiny black specks in this region are particles of carbon (soot), that glow on ignition and emit most of the light from the candle.<br>
C + O2 --> CO2 + light energy.<br>

The soot deposited is the carbon used in the manufacture of inks and motor tires.<br>
Whenever fuels, e.g. kerosene (paraffin oil), or coal or wood, burn with insufficient oxygen, similar deposits of carbon (soot), can be seen.<br>
1. Hold a glass rod in the centre of the flame.<br>
The rod becomes coated with a sooty black film called lamp black (carbon black).<br>
Carbon deposits on the glass rod, because not enough oxygen is available for complete combustion.<br>
2. Hold a wire gauze heating mat over the candle flame.<br>
The wire gauze cools the flame by conduction and carbon, soot, deposits.<br>
3. Sprinkle flour on the candle flame.<br>
The flour particles sparkle as they catch fire to leave specks of carbon.<br>
4. Bend lemon peel near a candle flame.<br>
The squeezed peel emits oil and water.<br>

Push a piece of cardboard sideways into the flame.<br>
The outside of the flame forms a sooty ring as it scorches the cardboard.<br>
So the hottest part of a candle flame is near the edge of the flame where there is enough oxygen to burn all the vaporized candle wax completely.<br>
The burning gases rise to the tip of the flame so that is the hottest part.<br>
The flame near the wick is yellow, because there is not enough oxygen for complete combustion and this causes the deposit of black (unburnt), carbon on the wick.<br>

Float a lighted tea candle in water.<br>
The flat top of the candle wax forms a cup of molten wax around the wick.<br>
The burning candle should balance symmetrically when floating and the cup of molten wax is also symmetrical.<br>
As the wick burns, the wax nearby melts and molten wax is drawn up through the wick by capillarity.<br>
As the molten wax nears the flame it evaporates and the vapour rises and ignites.<br>
The ascending current of air above the flame keeps the outside edge of the candle wax cool forming a cup for the molten wax around the wick.<br>

<a href="/images/6.35.0.gif">See diagram 8.3.0</a>: Candles burning in closed containers.<br>
 1. Attach a tall candle and a short candle to the bottom of a trough.<br>
 Add water to the trough and note the water level.<br>
 Light both candles.<br>
 Put a large jar upside down over the candles.<br>
 The tall candle extinguishes first then the short candle.<br>
 Hot gas products of combustion including carbon dioxide gas have filled the jar from the top down to extinguish the candle flames.<br>
 Some hot gases push out under the rim of the jar to form bubbles around the jar in the trough.<br>
 When the candles are extinguished, the hot gases cool and contract to form a partial vacuum and the water level rises inside the jar.<br>
 Some decrease in volume will be caused by the candle wax burning to form carbon dioxide and water.<br>
 Some of the carbon dioxide will dissolves in the water from the trough and the water vapour formed will condense to form liquid water.<br>
 More air escaped from the jar in the beginning due to large amount of heat released by the two candles.<br>
 2. When we ignite the candle, the stearin (purified fatty acids), reacts with oxygen (in excess), to produce carbon dioxide and water.<br>
 The burning causes air currents to shape the candle flame and ensure complete combustion at the bottom and the outer surface of the flame.<br>
 The hot air and products of combustion rise up above the flame.<br>
 3. When a jar is placed over the burning candle the hot gases in the jar expand and pushing some of the air out of the jar as bubbles in the water.<br>
 As soon as the rim of the jar touches the water, the burning occurs in a closed environment.<br>
 Further pressing the jar down into the water helps to retain the hot air in the jar under a pressure greater than atmospheric pressure and balanced by the pressure of the depth of water.<br>
 The burning of hydrocarbon in the jar produces more molecules of carbon dioxide and water than the molecules of oxygen consumed in the reaction.<br>
 The increased heat and number of molecules increases the pressure in side as a result if not careful some bubbles of gas will escape from the jar.<br>
 Over the time the oxygen in the jar is reduced and conditions for burning are changed.<br>
 3. Burning under reduced oxygen may not produce carbon dioxide rather a little carbon monoxide.<br>
 When the candle is put out, the temperature decreases followed by also a decrease in pressure due to condensation of water vapour and decreased quantity of air due to thermal expansion during the process of placing the jar on the candle.<br>
 The overall situation is a decrease in pressure inside the jar as compared to atmospheric pressure so despite water being heavier than air, it is pulled into the jar.<br>
 A negligible amount of carbon dioxide is dissolved in the water during 30 - 40 minutes, the time the experiment usually takes for performing in a classroom situation.<br>
 4. If the number of candles is increased in the jar, the heat produced is more therefore more air is likely to escape from the jar due to thermal expansion during the process of pacing the jar over them.<br>
 Therefore, more water will rise in the jar with more candles.<br>
 The nature and quantity of the products will depend upon the composition of candle material.<br>
 However, it is assumed that combustion of saturated hydrocarbons is taking place during burning.<br>
 4. For the paraffins in the stearin candle, chain length, n = about 30 cm.<br>
 During combustion the solid stearin combines with oxygen gas to form carbon dioxide + water vapour.<br>
 So the expansion of gases caused by this chemical reaction = 4/3 = 1.3'.<br>
 2CH2 (s) + 3O2 (g)--> 2CO2 (g) + 2H2O (g)<br>
 However, after the candles are extinguished, drops of water appear on the inside of the jar caused by condensation, so 3 volumes of oxygen have produced 2 volumes of carbon dioxide, a contraction of 2/3.<br>
 5. Previously, teachers taught that the candle become extinguished, because all of the oxygen under the inverted jar "was used up", i.e. converted to carbon dioxide, and so the decrease in volume of air under
 the jar after the candles are extinguished indicating the proportion of oxygen in the air.<br>
 However, some oxygen remains in the inverted jar as can be demonstrated by testing with yellow phosphorus.<br>
 6. The rapid rise of water level in the jar after the candles are extinguished is caused by decrease in pressure as the hot gases cool and the condensation of water vapour.<br>
 The amount of condensation of water will depend upon the temperature difference between initial and final temperatures of the air in the jar.<br>
 Since air is above water, therefore saturated water vapour pressure is considered in the beginning of the experiment.<br>
 Increase in temperature, during the candle burning, will make air unsaturated to accommodate additional water vapours especially produced as a product of burning.<br>
 A decrease in temperature over time after the candle is off to the initial temperature will help water vapour to condense.<br>
 This condensation will decrease the pressure inside the jar and will help water rise in the jar.<br>
 The amount of water vapours condensed during a small change of temperature as usually occurs in this experiment may even be too small to notice.<br>
 A little carbon dioxide dissolves in the water during the experiment.<br>
 A jar full of carbon dioxide inverted over a trough of water does not completely dissolve after some days.<br>
 7. To study the level of water rise when the candle was put out as soon jar touched the water, a floating candle was used and it was made to sink as soon as jar touched the water in the trough.<br>
 It was found that water did rise to some extent, indicating that some air escaped from the jar, because hot air and burning products entered the jar from the candle during the process of placing the jar
 over the candle.<br>
 The oxygen in the jar after the candle was extinguished produced rust in steel wool, reacted with yellow phosphorus to produce white smoke of oxide and supported survival of a mouse and insect for a long
 time.<br>
 8. To test whether the presence of carbon dioxide or lack of oxygen extinguishes the candle, remove the carbon dioxide from the jar by using sodium hydroxide solution in the trough in place of water.<br>
 Also you can spray cotton wool with sodium hydroxide and attach it to the bottom of the jar before it is inverted on the candle.<br>
 The candle burning time was almost doubled indicating that it is thepresence of carbon dioxide that extinguishes the candle.<br>
 When a candle burning under a jar inverted over water in a trough was repeated using two and three candles.<br>
 The level of water in the jar increased with an increase in number of candles.<br>
 This finding was used to emphasize that more oxygen is escaped from the jar before or during the burning of candles.<br>
 However, it is not true that more oxygen was consumed with the increase in the number of candles.<br>

 Magnesium has density 1.74 g / cm<sup>3 </sup>and melting point 650<sup>o</sup>C, but magnesium oxide has density 3.58 g /cm<sup>3</sup> and melting point
 2 800<sup>o</sup>C, because the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-- O<sup>2-</sup> chemical bond is stronger than the Mg -- Mg bond.<br>
Experiments<br>
Experiment 1. Polish 3 cm of magnesium ribbon with emery paper, then use tongs to hold it in a flame.<br>
 When the magnesium ignites, hold it out of the flame and over an evaporating basin.<br>
 Do not look directly at the burning magnesium, because it emits a very bright light.<br>
 The magnesium takes fire and burns with a white, dazzling flame, leaving a white ash.<br>
Magnesium burns more easily than iron, forming white magnesium oxide, the ash.<br>
 Do not heat magnesium powder, because it may explode!<br>

Experiment 2. The magnesium ash appears lighter than the original magnesium ribbon.<br>
 To test this observation, weigh a clean dry crucible with lid, add a 15 cm coil of polished magnesium ribbon, then weigh the crucible with lid + magnesium.<br>
 Use a Bunsen burner flame to heat the crucible on a pipe clay triangle.<br>
 Occasionally raise the lid slightly with tongs to allow air to enter the crucible.<br>
 When burning ceases, heat the crucible for a short time without the lid, then leave the crucible to cool with the lid on.<br>
 Weigh the crucible with lid + ash.<br>
 The weight of the crucible with lid + ash &gt; weight of crucible with lid + magnesium ribbon, because oxygen from the air had combined with the magnesium to form magnesium oxide.<br>
Experiment 3. Repeat the experiment with the coil of magnesium covered with 1 cm thickness of sodium chloride.<br>
 After heating, the magnesium does not change in weight, because the layer of salt prevented the magnesium from contacting oxygen in the air.<br>
Experiment 4. Hold a 10 cm strip of magnesium ribbon in a pair of tongs.<br>
 Place the ribbon in a Bunsen burner flame until it starts to burn.<br>
 Be careful! Magnesium burns with a very bright white light.<br>
 Magnesium ribbon corrodes slightly in air and burns with an intense white flame to form a white ash of magnesium oxide.<br>
 Mg + O2 --> MgO.<br>
Experiment 5. Clean 25 cm of magnesium ribbon and cut into pieces 1 cm long.<br>
 Put the pieces into a crucible with a lid.<br>
 Weigh the crucible + lid + contents = W1.<br>
 Put the crucible on a pipe clay triangle on a tripod stand.<br>
 Heat gently then strongly.<br>
 Use tongs to raise the lid.<br>
 The magnesium darkens before it melts.<br>
 When the magnesium starts to burn, put the lid back on the crucible and remove the burner.<br>
 Every few seconds raise the lid slightly to let more air enter.<br>
 Do not let white magnesium oxide smoke escape.<br>
 When the magnesium does not burn after you raise the lid, remove the lid and heat the crucible strongly.<br>
 Hold the lid ready in case the magnesium starts to burn again.<br>
 Let the crucible cool.<br>
 Again weigh the crucible + lid + contents = W2.<br>
 Note W2 &gt; W1.<br>
 The formation of magnesium oxide causes the increase in weight.<br>
Experiment 6. Reports on "To derive the empirical formula of MgO"<br>
Report 1. I have been unable to obtain useful data when burning magnesium.<br>
My problems have been, igniting the Mg, keeping the Mg burning and recording little or no mass gain.<br>
We ended up with a gain in mass, not what you would expect based on the mass used, though it gave us something to talk about regarding errors and accuracy.<br>
Report 2. Use a coiled longer piece and make sure that as much of it as possible is in contact with the crucible.<br>
Leave the lid off until it ignites, then whilst still heating keep cracking the lid, (tongs holding crucible lid) to let more O2 in without releasing too much ash until the reaction appears complete.<br>
Report 3. Sand the magnesium before experimenting to remove the oxide layer and then placed the magnesium within the crucible, leaving the lid open until it was just going to react.<br>
Report 4. Our gas lines in the laboratory lose pressure around the room, so it took some time to get the magnesium fully burnt.<br>
Very carefully, we lifted the crucible lid slightly, but moving it up and down a bit in a fanning type of action, to get air into it.<br>
We did this many times during 20 to 30 minutes, to get a good burn.<br>
Each time, as the magnesium glowed well and started burning to produce white smoke, we put the lid down to trap all products.<br>
We kept on going with the heating and letting air in, until the magnesium appeared fully burnt and not lighting up any more.<br>
Each student group were given a different length of magnesium - 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 cm).
The result was that the ratio was almost exactly 1:1 for every student group.

 Magnesium oxide is a metallic oxide, and is therefore basic.<br>
 Magnesium oxide has a low solubility in water.<br>
 Dilute hydrochloric acid reacts rapidly with aqueous magnesium hydroxide, but slowly with solid magnesium oxide.<br>
 Magnesium oxide dissolves slowly in water.<br>
 Phenolphthalein is an indicator that shows changes in alkalinity of the
 solution.<br>
 An equilibrium is established between solid magnesium oxide and dissolved 
 magnesium ions.<br>
 The addition of acid disrupts the equilibrium by removing hydroxide 
 ions from the solution.<br>
 An equilibrium is established between solid magnesium oxide and dissolved 
 magnesium ions.<br>
 The addition of acid disrupts the equilibrium by removing hydroxide 
 ions from the solution.<br>
 Equilibrium is restored by slow dissolving of more magnesium oxide.<br>
 Addition of larger drops or higher concentration of acid causes a larger
 initial excess of acid in the solution.<br>
 Because the reaction of acid with the solid magnesium oxide is slow, 
 it will take a much longer time for the pink colour to return to the 
 mixture.<br>
 The magnesium oxide formed from combustion of magnesium ribbon forms
 a hard mass with a small surface area for reaction.<br>
 The rate of reaction with acid, and the rate of solution of the solid 
 to form an alkaline solution, would be increased by crumbling the ash.<br>
 Magnesium oxide is used as a component of refractory crucibles, fire
 bricks, insulation, rubber compounds, magnesia cements and 
 boiler scale compounds, as a reflector in optical instruments and a
white colour standard.<br>
 Magnesium oxide fume, airborne magnesium oxide and magnesia fume is an
 odourless white opaque smoke.<br>
 Solid magnesium oxide is a hygroscopic fine white powder.<br>
 It is slightly soluble in water, pH of a saturated aqueous solution is 10.3.<br>
 It is soluble in dilute acids and ammonium salts.<br>
 It reacts violently with strong acids and halogens.<br>

 for combustion, to ignite, ignition point<br>
 Combustion is the burning, usually in oxygen gas, of a substance releasing
 heat energy and light energy.<br>
 Ignition temperature is the temperature at which the substance ignites, 
 e.g. sulfur must reach a temperature of about 400<sup>o</sup>C before it 
 will burn.<br>
 To ignite means to makes something intensely hot by the action of fire, 
 to heat something to the point of combustion or chemical change, 
 to set fire to something, to catch fire and begin to burn, to cause 
 an electric arc, to start combustion in the cylinder of an internal 
 combustion engine.<br>
 The ignition point is the temperature at which the rate of reaction 
 is high enough to produce more heat than is lost to its surroundings.<br>
 When the heat energy accumulates it increases the rate of reaction, 
 so a fire occurs.<br>
